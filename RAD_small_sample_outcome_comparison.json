        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] XXXX XXXX (the \"principal appellant\"), his wife XXXX XXXX and their minor children XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX (the \"associated appellants\"), citizens of Bangladesh, appeal a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (the \"RPD\") rejecting their claim for refugee protection.\nDETERMINATION OF THE APPEAL\n[2] Pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the \"Act\"),1 the Refugee Appeal Division (the \"RAD\") confirms the determination of the RPD, namely, that the appellants are neither Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the Act nor persons in need of protection pursuant to section 97 of the Act. This appeal is therefore dismissed.\nBACKGROUND\n[3] The RPD heard the appellants' refugee protection claim on September 12, 2013. The RPD's reasons for the decision are dated October 21, 2013 and the Notice of Decision is dated October 28, 2013.\n[4] The principal appellant is XXXX years old, his wife is XXXX and their three children are aged XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX. All the appellants are citizens of Bangladesh. The principal appellant's wife and the three minor children relied on the Basis of the Claim (BOC) form put forward by the principal appellant to support their respective claims.\n[5] The principal appellant stated that he has been a long-time supporter and member of the Bangladesh National Party (BNP). He has been a member of the BNP since 1986. His father was also a member of the BNP. The principal appellant left Bangladesh in 1989 to work in XXXX. He remained in Switzerland until 2006. Two of his children were born in XXXX.\n[6] The principal appellant returned to Bangladesh in 2006 and opened up his own XXXX business. The company was successful and the principal appellant was well off financially. Upon returning to Bangladesh, the political situation in Bangladesh was in flux. The BNP which had been in power since 2006 was about to be removed from power. A military caretaker government replaced the BNP in 2007 and ultimately the Awami League came to power. The principal appellant was asked to take up the position of XXXX XXXX for the BNP XXXX Branch. The leader of this Branch was a person that the principal appellant referred to as Brother XXXX. The principal appellant stated in his BOC that he was asked to take the position as a result of his contribution to the BNP since his return to Bangladesh. The principal appellant stated that he provided pamphlets to inform people of upcoming BNP meetings and that he spoke at rallies.\n[7] The principal appellant did not have any problems in Bangladesh until XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010. On that day, the principal appellant received a visit from two officers of the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) at his home. The principal appellant explained that these two individuals worked for the Intelligence Branch of the Army. The two officers informed the principal appellant that he was required to meet their Superior, XXXX XXXX. The officers left his home but they called the principal appellant on XXXX XXXX, 2010. The officer who called the principal appellant threatened him and told him his life would be in danger if he did not meet XXXX XXXX.\n[8] The principal appellant received another call on that day, this time from XXXX XXXX himself. XXXX XXXX told him that if he did not meet with him at 2 PM on XXXX XXXX, 2010, that he would send his force to abduct him and his children. The principal appellant reported to XXXX XXXX as directed. He was held in a dark room and tortured. XXXX XXXX wanted some information from the principal appellant on his connection to XXXX XXXX, a high ranking member of the BNP. The principal appellant paid some money and was released from custody.\n[9] The principal appellant did not have any contact with the authorities in Bangladesh until XXXX XXXX, 2010. On that day, he received a phone call from an officer ordering him to meet XXXX XXXX. He did not meet with XXXX XXXX but instead he went to the police to report this incident. The police at first refused to take a report but after the principal appellant insisted and paid a bribe, they agreed. The principal appellant stated that the police informed the DGFI that he had filed a report against them. The principal appellant lived in fear after this time and went into hiding although he continued to attend BNP rallies and conferences as well as continuing to manage his business.\n[10] The principal appellant and his family believe that they will be persecuted or killed by the authorities or the Awami League if they return to Bangladesh. They do not believe that they can obtain adequate state protection or that there is anywhere safe within Bangladesh for them to live.\n[11] The RPD's written reasons dated October 21, 2013, stated that the appellants' case for refugee protection was rejected. The determinative issue in this claim was credibility. The appellant is represented for this appeal by the same legal counsel as at his RPD hearing.\nSubmissions\n[12] As grounds for this appeal, counsel for the appellants submits that:\n* the RPD erred in law in arriving at a negative decision on the claim;\n* the RPD based its decision on erroneous findings of facts made in a perverse and capricious manner and\/or without regard to the material before it;\n* the RPD based its decision on its own assumptions and contrary to evidence before it;\n* the RPD's negative decision is not supported by the evidence before it and is based upon irrelevant considerations;\n* the RPD erred in law wherein it failed to provide the reasons in details, on the credibility finding;\n* the RPD exceeded in its jurisdiction on the issue of negative credibility findings; and\n* the RPD misconstrued the evidence, and the negative decision based upon the misconstrued evidence is an error in law and is reviewable by the RAD.\n[13] While counsel for the appellants has not expressed the remedy sought in this appeal, for purposes of this appeal it is deemed that the appellants have requested that the RAD, under subsection 111(b) of the Act, set aside the determination of the RPD and substitute a determination that the appellants are Convention refugees or persons in need of protection, or in the alternative, refer the matter back to a different Member of the RPD for redetermination.\n[14] Counsel for the appellants has not made any submissions as to the standard of review in this appeal.\n[15] The Minister has not intervened in this appeal. The Minister had intervened at the time of the RPD hearing on the basis of potential exclusion under Article 1F(c) of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (the \"Convention\")2 relating to the principal appellant's membership in the BNP during the period 2001 to 2006. The RPD Member found that the Minister had not established that the principal appellant should be excluded pursuant to Article 1 F(c) of the Convention as the principal appellant had not provided sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to establish that he was a member of the BNP.\nConsideration of New Evidence\n[16] The appellants have not submitted new evidence pursuant to subsection 110(4) of the Act.\nApplication for an Oral Hearing\n[17] Subsection 110(3) of the Act requires that the RAD proceed without a hearing, on the basis of the RPD Record, while allowing the RAD to accept documentary evidence and submissions from the Minister and the appellant.\n[18] According to subsection 110(6), the RAD may hold a hearing if, in its opinion, there is documentary evidence referred to in subsection 110(3) that raises a serious issue with respect to the credibility of the appellant, that is central to the RPD decision, and that, if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the refugee protection claim.\n[19] When read together, subsections 110(3), (4), and (6) establish that the RAD must not hold a hearing in an appeal such as this unless there is new evidence,3 in which case the RAD may hold a hearing if that new evidence raises a serious issue with respect to the credibility of the appellant, is central to the RPD decision, and that, if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the refugee protection claim.\n[20] As discussed above, no new evidence has been submitted in support of this appeal. As such, the RAD must proceed without a hearing in this appeal.\nStandard of Review\n[21] Although the Act sets out grounds for appeal as well as possible remedies, it does not specify the standard of review to be applied by the RAD.\n[22] In Dunsmuir,4 the Supreme Court of Canada (the \"Supreme Court\") considered the foundations of judicial review and the applicable standards of review, concluding that there are two standards of review: correctness and reasonableness. Dunsmuir has limited applicability to the RAD, however, which is not a reviewing court but rather an administrative appellate body. In Khosa,5 the Supreme Court gave broad deference to a tribunal's interpretation of its own statute but again, this was not specifically in the context of an appeals tribunal reviewing the decision of a tribunal of first instance. As the RAD is a statutory creation, the standard of review must be extracted from the legislation.\n[23] I find that the issues raised in this appeal relating to the RPD Member's credibility findings are issues of fact.\n[24] In Newton,6 the Alberta Court of Appeal (the \"Alberta Court\"), having considered Dunsmuir and other jurisprudence, considered the standard of review to be applied by an appellate administrative tribunal to a decision of a lower tribunal. The Alberta Court's analysis is therefore relevant in the context of the RAD, which has considered the factors set out in Newton.\n[25] The Newton7 factors deal with the standard of review to be applied by an appellate administrative tribunal to the decision of an administrative tribunal of first instance, such as is the case with the RPD and RAD. Based on the guidance in Newton, the RAD focused on the factors listed below to determine the standard of review. The contextual approach to assessing which factors are most appropriate in setting the standard of review has been established in Khosa.8 The most significant factors to consider in establishing the standard of review of a decision by a tribunal of first instance by an appellate tribunal are:\n* the respective roles of the RPD and RAD in the context of the Act;\n* the expertise and advantageous position of the RPD Member compared to that of the RAD; and\n* the nature of the question in issue.\n[26] Both the RPD and the RAD derive their jurisdiction from and interpret the same home statute: the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Subsection 162(1) of the Act gives each Division, including the RPD, \"in respect of proceedings brought before it under this Act, sole and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine all questions of law and fact, including questions of jurisdiction.\" The RAD has been given the supervisory jurisdiction to decide appeals of RPD decisions related to refugee protection on questions of law, of fact, or of mixed law and fact.9 The level of deference which the RAD provides to the RPD depends on the questions at issue as addressed above.\n[27] The presence of a right of appeal does not warrant a correctness standard of review given the prescribed relationship between the RPD and RAD, and the limits imposed on the RAD in the Act.\n[28] The RAD finds that the RPD is to be provided with deference on questions of fact as it relates to the assessment of the claim for protection. The RPD is a tribunal of first instance which has been given the authority in the Act to make a decision to accept or reject a claim for protection.10 RPD Members have expertise in interpreting and applying the Act, as well as are experts in assessing claims based on country conditions. The RPD must conduct a hearing11 and assesses the totality of the evidence, including evidence related to the credibility of the appellant and witnesses, after it has had an opportunity to see the appellant, hear his testimony and question him.\n[29] In contrast to the RPD's authority to assess a claim for protection, the Act limits the RAD's ability to gather and consider evidence. The RAD is not a tribunal of first instance but exists to review the decision made by the RPD. The RAD must proceed without a hearing on the basis of the Record, submissions by the parties, and new evidence.12 Appeals to the RAD are party-driven and do not provide appellants an opportunity to have their claims heard de novo. The RAD's authority to hold hearings is limited to evidence that arose after the rejection of the claim or that was not reasonably available, or that the person could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection.13 Hearings are also limited to only specific issues (serious credibility issues) which are directed by the RAD.14\n[30] Given that the RPD has held a hearing on the totality of the evidence and given that the RPD has heard from the appellant directly at a hearing, the RPD is in the best position to assess the credibility of the appellant and to make findings on issues of fact related to the claim. This position is consistent with Newton at paragraph 82 where it indicates:\nThe [Refugee Appeal Division] is not a tribunal of first instance, and cannot simply ignore the proceedings before the presiding officer and the conclusions reached by him.15\n[31] Newton concludes that: \"a decision on such questions of fact by the presiding officer, as the tribunal of first instance, are entitled to deference. Unless the findings of fact are unreasonable, the [Refugee Appeal Division] should not interfere\".16 Newton adopts the definition of \"reasonableness\" in Dunsmuir. Reasonableness is concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process of the RPD; and that the RPD decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law.17\n[32] For the reasons outlined above, the RAD has afforded a considerable level of deference to RPD findings on questions of fact in this claim and will consider whether the findings of fact raised in this appeal relating to the RPD Member's credibility findings meet the reasonableness test.\nAnalysis of the Merits of the Appeal\n[33] I will now turn to the specific submissions by the appellant as to errors allegedly made by the RPD.\n[34] Counsel for the appellants submits the negative credibility finding of the RPD Member is wrong in law and fact and is highly unreasonable. Counsel for the appellant submits that the RPD Member did not examine or evaluate the principal appellant's claim based on the evidence of fear of the DGFI due to his affiliation with the BNP and his personal relationship with XXXX XXXX.\n[35] The RPD Member's overall credibility findings were based on a clear and detailed discussion of the principal appellant's testimony and other evidence. In reference to the principal appellant's allegation of his long-standing membership in the BNP and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for the BNP in XXXX, the principal appellant claimed he had never been in possession of a BNP membership card nor had he paid any fees or annual dues nor was he able to explain the steps a person needed to follow to become a member of the BNP. The only explanation the principal appellant could provide for his lack of knowledge of how persons would become members of the BNP was that his superior, Brother XXXX, took care of all these details. The principal appellant was also unable to provide any information of how the BNP party funded itself.\n[36] Counsel for the appellants referenced in his submissions that, prior to 2008, the BNP had no uniform method of documenting membership. In 2008, the BNP instituted a new system for documenting and enrolling new members. As the principal appellant was outside of Bangladesh from 1989 to 2006, counsel appears to be suggesting that his absence during this period would explain his inability to provide a reasonable explanation as to why the principal appellant could not explain how new members are enrolled into the BNP. However, as noted by counsel these changes came into effect as of 2008. It would therefore be reasonable to expect that if a person such as the principal appellant was active in the party and in a XXXX XXXX after 2008, he would be aware of these changes.\n[37] The RPD Member found that as allegedly a member of the BNP and more particularly as a public secretary for the BNP in XXXX, the principal appellant's inability to provide information on how the party is funded and how new members are enrolled negatively impacted his overall credibility. Based on the evidence provided, I find that the RPD Member's conclusion in this respect was reasonable.\n[38] In reference to the principal appellant's oral testimony, the RPD Member noted that the principal appellant's testimony included several significant aspects of his alleged experience with the DGFI that had not been related in his BOC. At the hearing, the principal appellant testified that when the two officers came to his home they were in possession of the photo of him and XXXX XXXX that had been taken in XXXX in 2002 by a friend. The principal appellant stated that the officers recognized the same photo hanging on the wall of his home. As a result, the two officers then called XXXX XXXX and confirmed to him that the principal appellant had the same photo hanging on the wall in his home. The principal appellant stated that he was then ordered to come with the officers to meet with XXXX XXXX. The principal appellant also stated he had received numerous threatening calls and visits from the authorities at his home. When asked by the RPD Member why he had not included this information in his BOC, the principal appellant responded that he thought he could tell his entire story at the RPD hearing. The RPD Member did not accept this explanation and found that the principal appellant had improvised his testimony by embellishing his claim and adding telephone threats and home visits to raise his level of risk. Based on the evidence provided, I find that the RPD Member's conclusion in this respect was reasonable.\n[39] In his reasons the RPD Member stated that the claimant testified at the hearing that all law enforcement is corrupt in Bangladesh, specifically mentioning the police, Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) and the DGFI. The RPD Member found implausible that the appellant would approach the police to file a report against the DGFI if he believed that the entire law enforcement apparatus was under the corrupt control of the Awami League. Counsel submits that there is no basis for the inference that, because the appellant believes the police in Bangladesh are corrupt, it is implausible that he ever would have gone to them for assistance in the past, even in the most serious situations. Later in the memorandum of argument, counsel states that the appellant had not stated he has a fear of all authorities in Bangladesh but only of the TGFI who is hunting him for his affiliation with XXXX XXXX and later for filing a claim against them with the police. I note that in the principal appellant's BOC he states that he fears TGF or other government organizations referred to as RAB and DB. As indicated above, the RAB is the Rapid Action Battalion. The United Kingdom country of origin report for Bangladesh in the Immigration and Refugee Board's country National Documentation Packages indicates that the country's internal security establishment consists primarily of the police and auxiliary (paramilitary) forces, one of which is the RAB. Later on, the same document indicates that the DB appears to represent the Detective Branch of the Bangladesh police. Given that it is the principal appellant who in his BOC expressed fear of the security forces including the RAB and Detective Branch of Bangladesh police, I find to be reasonable the RPD Member's conclusion that it is implausible that he would approach the police to file a report against the DGFI.\n[40] Counsel for the appellants submits that the RPD Member's having assigned little weight to the support letters provided by the President of the Bangladesh Jatiyatabadi Jubo Dal (BJJ), the youth wing of the BNP, exceeds his jurisdiction as a refugee claimant is entitled to present evidence such as a letter in support of his character.\n[41] In reference to the BJJ support letters submitted into evidence, the RPD Member found that the principal appellant's failure to make a distinction in his BOC or testimony between the BJJ and the BNP to be a material omission in this claim. The BJJ, while having an association to the BNP, is a distinct organization. The RPD Member found that the principal appellant's failure to make this distinction is a material omission in this claim that reflects negatively upon his overall credibility. Based on the evidence provided, I find that the RPD Member's conclusion in this respect was reasonable.\n[42] The RPD Member also referred to the second letter from the BJJ having been provided to the principal appellant to respond to the Minister's allegation of potential exclusion under Article 1F(c) of the Convention relating to the principal appellant's membership in the BNP during the period 2001 to 2006.. The RPD Member gave the BJJ letters little weight as they appear to have been tailored by the principal appellant to contain language that is favorable to him and in response to the Minister's intervention. I find that it was open to the RPD Member to assign appropriate weight to this evidence based on his analysis of the contents and provenance of the letters. This does not signify that the letters were ignored but they were evaluated in the context of the totality of the evidence.\n[43] The RPD Member found that the principal appellant's return to Bangladesh, when he travelled to Sweden in July 2012, reflected a lack of subjective fear of the authorities in Bangladesh. When asked if he attempted to submit an asylum claim in Sweden the principal claimant responded that he did not want to leave Bangladesh at that time. Given that the significant events underlying the principal appellant's claim for refugee protection occurred in 2010, I find that the RPD Member's conclusion that the principal appellant showed a lack of subjective fear was reasonable.\n[44] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find that the RPD Member's findings of fact were reasonable. The RPD Member did not misstate or misconstrue the evidence in coming to his clear and supported credibility findings. Having considered all the evidence, I find that these reasons do fall within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law. The associated appellants did not submit any materials or submissions different from the ones submitted by the principal appellant so for the same reasons, their appeals are also dismissed.\nREMEDY\n[45] For all these reasons, I confirm the determination of the RPD, namely, that the appellants are neither Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the Act nor persons in need of protection pursuant to section 97 of the Act. This appeal is therefore dismissed.\n(signed)\n\"Douglas Fortney\"\nFebruary 18, 2014\nDate\nArticle 1 of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, Res. 2198 (XXI) General Assembly\nF.

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX (the Principal Appellant) and his wife, XXXX XXXX (the Associate Appellant), are citizens of Nepal. They appeal a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejecting their claims for refugee protection. The Appellants allege a fear of persecution from the Biplav (Biplab) Maoists upon return to Nepal based on the Principal Appellant's political opinion, as a member of the opposition Rastriya Prajatantra Party Nepal (RPP), also known as the National Democratic Party Nepal. The Appellants argue that the RPD erred when it found their claim is not objectively well-founded. Having independently assessed all of the evidence, including the RPD hearing audio-recording, I find that the RPD erred. I find that the Appellants' claim is well-founded and that they are Convention refugees. I have addressed why the RPD's findings are in error before providing my reasons for allowing the appeal and accepting the Appellants' claims.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] The appeal is allowed. The Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) sets aside the determination of the RPD and substitutes its own determination that the Appellant is a Convention refugee.1\nBACKGROUND\nThe Appellant's allegations\n[3] The Principal Appellant alleges that Maoists seized his family land in Sarlahi in 2005 as retribution for not cooperating with their cause. During the course of the civil war, the Principal Appellant alleges multiple acts of political persecution as a result of his RPP activities. As a result, he has lived for many years in Qatar as a temporary resident. After the Comprehensive Peace Accord (CPA) was signed in 2006, the Principal Appellant alleges that he asked the local administration to facilitate the return of the family property. However, the Maoists refused. He alleges that due to his father's illness and his only brother's poor relationship with the family, he is in charge of ensuring the family land is returned.\n[4] In XXXX 2011, the Principal Appellant alleges that he was physically attacked by Maoists after he enquired about the return of his family's land. In XXXX 2018, the Appellants decided to return permanently to Nepal from Qatar following the promulgation of the new constitution. He alleges that the Biplav faction of the Maoists gained control of his family property. On XXXX XXXX, 2018, the Principal Appellant alleges that he was physically attacked and threatened by Biplav Maoists who told him that they are not just after him because of his demand for his family land but also because of his political opinion. Specifically, that as a member of the RPP, he supports the monarchy and hates the Maoists, peasants, and the poor.2 They threatened to kill him if he does not fund and join their party. On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018, the Principal Appellant was threatened again, this time in Kathmandu. On XXXX XXXX, 2018, the Appellants allege that they were threatened with death and physically attacked, resulting in the Associate Appellant's miscarriage. They fled Nepal for Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2018, initiating their refugee claims shortly after their arrival.\nThe RPD's decision\n[5] The RPD notes that an inconsistency arose in the Principal Appellant's testimony regarding the reason for his visits to Nepal in 2011 and 2014, whether to care for his ailing father or for his marriage. However, the RPD does not make any adverse credibility findings with respect to the Appellants' allegations. The RPD found that the Appellants' claim is not objectively well-founded. Specifically, that the Appellants do not face a serious possibility of persecution upon return to Nepal if the Principal Appellant discontinues his quest to reclaim his family land. The RPD also found that the Biplav Maoists pose a \"generalized risk\" and that the Principal Appellant's political profile would not make him a prime target for the Biplav Maoists.3\nROLE OF THE RAD\n[6] I have conducted an independent assessment of the evidence. I am reviewing the RPD's decision on the correctness standard as I do not find the RPD enjoyed a meaningful advantage.4\nNO NEW EVIDENCE AND NO JURISDICTION TO HOLD AN ORAL HEARING\n[7] The Appellants have not submitted new evidence in support of their appeal. Having admitted no new evidence, the RAD has no jurisdiction to convene an oral hearing.5\nANALYSIS\nThe Appellants' claim against Nepal is well-founded\n[8] The RPD found that the Appellants' claim is not objectively well-founded. Counsel argues that this finding was made without assessing the totality of the evidence. I agree. After listening to the RPD hearing audio-recording and independently assessing all of the evidence, I find that the RPD erred.\nThe RPD erred in assessing the Principal Appellant's claim\n[9] The RPD found that the persecution arose as a punitive measure for the Principal Appellant's efforts to reclaim his family land. As a result, the RPD found that the Appellants could safely return to Nepal should the Principal Appellant discontinue his quest to reclaim his family land. Generally speaking, \"[C]laimants who are able to make reasonable choices and thereby free themselves of a risk of harm must be expected to pursue those options.\"6 In this context, it is not an error for the RPD to expect a Claimant to abandon their claim to property in order to avoid persecution in their country of nationality.7 However, this principle only applies where a Claimant is not being required to compromise either who they are or a fundamental belief.8 For the following reasons, I find that the RPD erred in applying this principle in the Appellants' claim.\n[10] In the instant case, the Principal Appellant's political opinion is directly engaged. The Principal Appellant alleges that the Biplav Maoists explicitly told him that they continue to target him because he is a member of the RPP who supports the monarchy and hates the Maoists, peasants, and the poor. The RPD does not impugn the credibility of this allegation. It is not the case that the agents of persecution are only interested in the Principal Appellant because of his attempts to reclaim his family land. As such, it is not clear that abandoning the property claim would enable the Appellants to return to Nepal without facing a serious possibility of persecution. The RPD's finding is in error.\n[11] The RPD also found that the Principal Appellant's profile would not entice his agents of persecution to force him to join their organization and notes that his political profile would not make him a prime target for the Biplav Maoists.9 The RPD does not refer to any objective evidence in support of this finding. It is unclear upon what basis the RPD found that the Principal Appellant's political opinion and profile would not place him and the Associate Appellant at a serious possibility of persecution upon return to Nepal. It is especially unclear when considered in light of the Appellants' uncontradicted allegation that they have survived no less than three politically motivated attacks from the Biplav Maoists - including physical violence, death threats, and demands for money and party membership - prior to fleeing Nepal. The Appellants' personal documentary evidence corroborates the Principal Appellant's political affiliation, land ownership, multiple reports to authorities, and physical attacks.10 The RPD's finding is in error.\n[12] Finally, the RPD's finding of \"generalized risk\" is misplaced. The Principal Appellant alleged a nexus to a Convention ground based on his political opinion. The RPD did not make a finding that the Appellants lack a nexus to a Convention ground. A generalized risk analysis is applicable to claims assessed under subsection 97(1) and not to claims alleging a serious possibility of persecution under section 96 of the IRPA.11 I find that the RPD erred.\nThe Appellants' claim is objectively well-founded\n[13] Having conducted my own assessment of the evidence, I find that the Appellants face a serious possibility of persecution upon return to Nepal and that their claims are well-founded. The National Documentation Package (NDP) for Nepal indicates that following the CPA, Maoist factions have retained illegally seized land and a \"a significant number of conflict-era land disputes remained outstanding.\"12 The NDP also indicates that the Biplav (Biplab) Maoist faction is involved in kidnapping, physical violence, and extortion.13 While information in the NDP indicates that Maoist attacks on opposition members have reduced, there are reports of continuing attacks.14 Counsel's April 2019 article from Al Jazeera indicates that the Biplav faction is \"fed by popular disillusionment and anger\" and that it is \"growing in strength.\"15\n[14] The Appellants must only make out more than a mere possibility of persecution in order to succeed in their claim for refugee protection. This is a low threshold. I find that the possibility that the Appellants will face persecution - including serious physical violence - by reason of the Principal Appellant's political opinion to be more than a mere one.\nState protection and an Internal Flight Alternative are not available to the Appellants\n[15] Having found that the Appellants face more than a mere possibility of persecution, I have also considered whether the Appellants have access to operationally adequate state protection in Nepal or a viable Internal Flight Alternative (IFA).\n[16] In March 2019 the Nepalese government officially declared the Biplav (Biplap) faction a criminal group and banned all of its activities.16 However, \"many local Maoist leaders have at least some sympathy for Biplab's party\" and the ban has served to bolster the faction's popularity and increase tensions.17 The NDP indicates that the police are not independent and often fail to carry out prompt, thorough, and impartial investigations.18 Despite seeking protection on multiple occasions, the Appellants were not provided with assistance. Nepal continues to suffer from a weakened criminal justice system and impunity.19 I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellants do not have access to adequate state protection in Nepal.\n[17] The NPD indicates that Nepal is a small country and that the Biplav Maoists have a nation-wide network.20 The Appellants were located by their agents of persecution in multiple cities within Nepal. On this basis, I find that the Appellants face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Nepal and that they do not have a viable IFA.\nCONCLUSION\n[18] The appeal is allowed. Pursuant to section 111(1)(b) of the IRPA, the RAD sets aside the determination of the RPD and substitutes its own determination that the Appellants are Convention refugees.\n(signed)\n\"J.

The Appellant has presented new evidence and has requested an oral hearing.\nDETERMINATION OF THE APPEAL\n[2] After asking questions across a range of issues and with respect to all aspects of the Appellant's allegations, the RPD reached a conclusion that, on a balance of probability, the Appellant's allegations lacked credibility. In reviewing the evidence, I am in agreement with this conclusion. Pursuant to section 111(1)(a) of Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) confirms the determination of the RPD, namely, that Ms. XXXX XXXX is not a \"Convention refugee\" pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA and\/or a \"person in need of protection\" pursuant to section 97 of the IRPA.\nBACKGROUND\n[3] The Appellant sets out that she lived with her family in Kuto, which is part of the Greater Banjul (city) Area, on the western end of the Republic of the Gambia. The Appellant alleges that she is a homosexual, which is a risk in itself, and, in addition, that if she returns to Gambia, she is at risk of persecution because her father will force her to marry and this will involve female genital mutilation (FGM).\n[4] The Appellant alleges that she was betrothed to a cousin when she was young and if she returns to Gambia, she must submit to FGM. The Appellant alleges that she has an older sister, identified as Fatou, who escaped this fate earlier by remaining in the US after being sent there to study. The Appellant alleges that another sister, identified as Bintou, also studied abroad but did return to Gambia and was forced to submit to the procedure of FGM and to an arranged marriage.\n[5] The Appellant also alleges that she has had a homosexual relationship in Canada and that given the treatment of homosexuals in Gambia and given her identity as a homosexual, she is at risk of return to Gambia for this reason.\n[6] The Appellant was last registered for classes at the University of XXXX in the winter semester of the 2012-13 academic year. When in 2014 the Appellant sought to extend her student visa, which was due to expire in June 2014, this was refused because the Appellant had not been continuously enrolled in a course of study in Canada. After receiving this student visa extension refusal, the Appellant submitted a refugee claim in November 2014.\n[7] With respect to the RPD's credibility assessment, which is the determinative issue in this claim, for a number of reasons, the RPD did not believe that the Appellant was at risk of persecution because it concluded that the Appellant did not meet her burden of establishing that her story was true on a balance of probability. The Appellant appealed this decision by submitting a Notice of Appeal, which was received by the RAD on March 5, 2015.\nSUBMISSIONS\n[8] The Appellant submits that the RPD erred in its overall adverse credibility conclusion, which involved the RPD making individual errors on important elements of the Appellant's claim.\n[9] The basic logic of the Appellant is that the objective evidence would show that women in Gambia are 'not equal' and are generally forcibly married and generally at risk of FGM. The Appellant also argues that homosexuality is given no State protection and given that the Appellant is a homosexual, there is a serious possibility that she will be persecuted for her sexual orientation, if she were to return to Gambia.\n[10] With respect to an outcome to this appeal, the Appellant seeks to have the RPD decision 'quashed' and the Appellant recognized as a Convention refugee. Alternatively, the Appellant seeks to have a re-hearing before the RAD based on the new evidence provided or perhaps the file might be returned to the RPD for reconsideration by a different panel.\nROLE AND FUNCTION OF THE RAD\n[11] I note that the RAD has now received Federal Court guidance on the role of the RAD vis-\u00e0-vis RPD decisions. Justice Phellan in Huruglica1 states that the RAD \"must review all aspects of the RPD's decision and come to an independent assessment of whether the claimant is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection\". He also indicates that there is no need for the RAD to enunciate a 'standard of review' and suggests that while the RAD might show some deference on a credibility assessment and\/or where the RPD enjoys a particular advantage in reaching such a conclusion, in other areas, such as an assessment of country conditions evidence, the RAD need not be deferential.\n[12] In Njeukam,2 Justice Locke references Huruglica and suggests that \"Except in cases where the credibility of a witness is critical or determinative or when the RPD has a particular benefit from the RAD to draw a specific conclusion, the RAD must not give any deference to the analysis of the evidence made by the RPD\".\n[13] Following Huruglica and Njeukam, I conclude that in this appeal, which turns on questions of fact, although I may show a degree of deference to the RPD with respect to its credibility assessment, I must provide my own assessment of the evidence to reach my own conclusion on this appeal.\nON THE REQUEST TO PRESENT NEW EVIDENCE AND A REQUEST FOR A HEARING\n[14] The Appellant provides new evidence in the form of an 'Appellant's Affidavit' (Appellant's Record, pp. 17-21). Based on section 110(4) of IRPA, I am accepting this evidence because it dates from after the RPD decision and it is relevant to the issues of the claim because it provides new insight into the Appellant's allegations.\n[15] Although I am accepting this evidence, given the entirety of the evidence, I do not find that this material is sufficient, or even has the potential, to justify allowing the refugee claim. This request for a hearing is therefore denied.\nANALYSIS OF THE MERITS OF THE APPEAL\nCore Issue: Did the Board err in its credibility findings?\n[16] The basic argument of the Appellant is that the RPD erred in its evaluation of the Appellant's testimony and corroborative evidence.\n[17] I note that the RPD decision is very detailed and developed and my only comment would be that the RPD might have fruitfully investigated the Appellant father's career and status to provide additional context as to how and why he would provide his children the resources to essentially travel and study where they wanted to (or could get accepted to in terms of educational institutions) in the developed world. Regardless, the RPD's analysis addresses the key allegations of the Appellant and I agree with its conclusions. The basic conclusion of the RPD is that the Appellant's allegations of risk of return to Gambia are simply inconsistent with the Appellant's behaviour and evidence which was elicited during the hearing process, which is to say, the allegations lack credibility on a balance of probability.\n[18] From my perspective, the key to understanding this appeal is to recognize that while the Appellant is a Sunni Muslim, she comes from an elite, educated and westernized strata of Gambian society. This can be seen from the Appellant's early education at the Gambia Methodist Academy (middle school) and Ndows High School (High School) (RPD Record, p. 33). Next, instead of attending university in Gambia, which the Appellant describes as not very good, the Appellant and at least two of her sisters before her, attended university overseas. In this case, the Appellant began at the XXXX School of Commerce (Tier 4 School) prior to seeking acceptance and enrolling at the University of XXXX(RPD Record, p. 33).\n[19] The basic logic of the Appellant in her appeal of the RPD's adverse decision on credibility is that: \"The subjective fear component is credible and consistent with that of a woman from an African country with her cultural background;\" (Appellant's Memorandum, paragraph C-11). The Appellant goes on, however, to identify low status woman in Gambian society as the reference group. For example, the Appellant notes that woman cannot complain to the police (Appellant's Memorandum, paragraph C-18) and \"Forced marriages are not against the laws in The Gambia\" (Appellant's Memorandum, paragraph C-20).\n[20] The fact is, however, that the specific circumstance of the Appellant is that of a well-educated, well-travelled and relatively prosperous (in the sense of access to resources) young woman from an urban area of Gambia. In the same source (US DOS Report) identified by the Appellant which underlines sections which are not relevant to the Appellant, including a statistic that 80% of girls and woman between the ages of 15 and 19 have undergone FGC\/C\", the source goes on to report, that \"...FGM\/C was less frequent among educated and urban groups\" (Appellant's Memorandum, paragraph C 14).\n[21] In this case, the Appellant is now XXXX years old, unmarried, is not circumcised, and admits to having received money from her father as late as September 2014. The Appellant has a sister in New Jersey who studied 'XXXX XXXX and business, which is consistent with the Father's profession, identified in the hearing as 'Business' and 'Building Contractor' (Oral hearing at minute 9). Put simply, this woman is from a higher socio-demographic strata in Gambia and she is not similarly situated with woman from rural areas or areas with traditional\/tribal norms.\n[22] With respect to the RPD's conclusion that the Appellant is not credible with relation to the allegation of FGM and forced marriage, I am in agreement with the RPD. The allegations are internally inconsistent, especially the logic as articulated by the Appellant during the hearing that she was sent to University to 'provide for the family' (Oral hearing at minute 24). This logic was somewhat modified when the Appellant stated that they (including her sisters) were also sent to university to be able to 'at least' \"provide for ourselves\" (Oral hearing at minute 25). I cannot accept an argument that this and other problems are really problems of plausibility, as suggested by the Appellant (Appellant's Memorandum, paragraph D 7). I must agree with the RPD that this logic is essentially incompatible with Appellant's allegations of FGC and forced marriage (RPD Decision, paragraph 15).\n[23] With respect to the allegation that the Appellant is at risk of return to Gambia because she is homosexual, the RPD found many problems with the Appellant's answers to questions. The RPD noted a lack of depth in the Appellant's answers (RPD Decision, paragraph 24), which overall were found not very 'satisfying'. I must conclude that the RPD undertook extensive questioning of the Appellant and reaches the conclusion that: \"The tribunal is not satisfied by the claimant's testimony about her relationship with XXXX and finds the claimant not to be credible; and does not believe the claimant would be at risk in Gambia because of a relationship with her\" (RPD Decision, paragraph 26).\n[24] I recognize that the wording of this RPD conclusion might be open to question because of the wording of \"because of a relationship with her\". My interpretation of the RPD conclusion is, however, as more fully developed below, that the Appellant was not believed, on a balance of probability, that there was a homosexual relationship between XXXX and the Appellant. In this area the RPD would have an advantage, having asked the Appellant questions directly and I must conclude that I must show the RPD deference on her conclusions.\n[25] As for the Appellant argument that: \"...the Board member failed to understand and consider is the fact that the appellant does not fear persecution because of her relationship with XXXX, but the fact that she is a lesbian; The Board member failed to conduct any meaningful analysis of the consequences of the appellant's homosexuality and the risks she faces upon return to The Gambia;\" (Appellant's Memorandum, paragraph D 23-24), I must conclude that the RPD is clear. The RPD did not believe that the Appellant had a homosexual relationship with Amber, assuming Amber exists (i.e., the RPD finds the testimony was not credible). I must admit that the RPD's statement that it \"...does not believe the claimant would be at risk in Gambia because of a relationship with her\" confuses the issue because it might be interpreted as meaning that there was an intimate relationship with XXXX. It could also be interpreted as simply meaning that they were friends and roommates which would not create a problem with the RPD's analysis. My conclusion is that the RPD is finding that a homosexual relationship with XXXX is only a story. Specifically this RPD section runs for several paragraphs and includes the following material:\n[24] The counsel argued that the claimant is nervous and embarrassed to talk about her relationship with XXXX. He also advised his client that the tribunal is not asking moral question and is not passing judgment. The tribunal agreed and explained to the claimant that she has heard such stories in the context of her work at the IRB and that the claimant will not be judged for her relationship. The tribunal just wants to understand her story. Moreover, it was pointed out to her that in her written narrative3 very little is written about the relationship with XXXX, and that so far her testimony does not give any details and could be said about a friendship as well; and the tribunal needs more details to understand what happened to her. However, the claimant is unable to give details about the development of her relationship, or why she felt attracted to XXXX: \"I feel attracted...\", \"I felt attracted to XXXX because I've been spending a lot of time with her and we do most of the things together...\", \"I felt like ... she was caring...\". There is not depth to the claimant's testimony on this subject; she is unable to explain her relationship with XXXX.\n[25] After the break, the claimant testified that she has never been attracted to guys as she is to females, that they would spend most of their time together going to class, to go out for coffee or a movie, always studying together, XXXX would sometimes sleep over, etc... After some questions from her counsel, the claimant explained that she would undress and take a shower when XXXX was present, and that she did not care to do this in front of her. Asked by her lawyer how they became intimate, she answered that they would touch each other's breast. Although this is more graphic than what she testified to before the break, this is not satisfying as it has no profundity, it does not need any personal investment such as feelings would (RPD Decision, paragraphs 24-25).\n[26] It should be recognized that the testimony implies that this has been the Appellant's first homosexual relationship (i.e., the risk arises because \"I once had a friend...\" Oral hearing at 1:13) and that it lasted for 6 months. I noted that there is also a reference to \"hanging around with other lesbian girls\" in Montreal. The point is that the RPD is reviewing what is perceived as a lack of clarity or halting testimony and which might be interpreted as 'feeling shame' or simply a function of the fact that the Appellant is telling a story and has not lived these experiences. Again the RPD has an advantage in having listened to the testimony to reach a conclusion.\n[27] I would also note that this risk of being viewed as a homosexual is viewed as less of a problem given that when asked directly about what she fears her answer was forced marriage and FGM (Oral hearing at minute 1:12). The risk as a homosexual was only elicited by prompting the Appellant (Oral hearing at minute 1:12-3). Based on a reading of the whole of this section (RPD Decision, paragraphs 21-26), however, I must conclude that the RPD is clearly articulating a conclusion that this story of a homosexual relationship, and by extension that the Appellant is homosexual, is not credible, on a balance of probability.\n[28] The remaining issue relates to a delay in claiming. My understanding of the RPD decision is that the key problem is that the Appellant was not driven to investigate and ensure that she would be able to secure a renewed student visa in Canada. For example, according to the RPD, \"The fact that the claimant came to Canada under a student visa, that she studied very little and stopped altogether in May 2013, but did not seem worried that this might put her status in Canada in jeopardy, shows a lack of concern as to the possibility to be sent back to Gambia\" (RPD Decision, paragraph 32). The Appellant focuses on the fact that the Appellant had a valid visa up until it expired, which allegedly explains the delay (Appellant's Memorandum, paragraph D-31).\n[29] I am in agreement with the RPD. The Appellant is being financially supported by her father to study in Canada but had stopped studying in early 2013. The Appellant is old enough to understand these proceedings and is well traveled and familiar with visa systems. If the Appellant were really concerned about the danger of returning to Gambia, it would be reasonable to expect more proactive behavior on the part of the Appellant, which, in this case, is not in evidence.\n[30] In reviewing the evidence, I agree with the RPD's conclusions.\nCONCLUSION\n[31] For all these reasons, I confirm the determination of the RPD, namely, that Ms. XXXX XXXX is neither a \"Convention refugee\" nor a \"person in need of protection\".\n[32] Therefore, her appeal is dismissed.\nStephen J.

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX (Principal Appellant), his wife XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (Associate Appellant), XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (collectively, the Minor Appellants) initiated refugee claims, alleging they faced persecution on the basis of the Associate Appellant's bisexuality. As well, they alleged they feared retribution due to the complaint the Principal Appellant made to the police about a governor's illegal activities.\n[2] Mr. XXXX worked as a XXXX XXXX in Nigeria and alleges that he learned of a colleague's involvement in helping the Governor illegally import firearms and ammunition. He alleges that he reported these illegal activities to the police, and as a result the Governor had the police break into and search his home. Mrs. XXXX alleges that her bisexual orientation was discovered when police found lesbian pornography in their home during the search. After news spread that she was a lesbian and her husband was supporting her sexual orientation, the Appellants fearing for their safety fled to Canada for protection.\n[3] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) found that the Appellants' testimony was not credibile, found that the allegations were implausible and rejected their claims. For the following reasons, the appeal is allowed and the matter is referred back to a differently constituted panel.\nROLE OF THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION\n[4] The Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) reviews decisions of the RPD on a standard of correctness after conducting an independent assessment of the evidence before it. The exception to this rule is where the RPD enjoys a meaningful advantage in the assessment and weighing of oral testimony heard, which in particular cases, attracts deference. Unless specifically stated below, I have applied a correctness standard.1\nANALYSIS\nAppellants' arguments\n[5] The Appellants argue that the RPD erred in making plausibility findings without considering cultural norms. The Appellants also argue that the RPD misconstrued the testimony of Mrs. XXXX in describing her responses about the pornography and made erroneous credibility findings. Further, the Appellants argue that the RPD did not properly weigh the documentary evidence and failed to assess the totality of the evidence in establishing the central issues to the claims.\nPlausibility and credibility findings of the RPD\nThe Principal Appellant's allegation\n[6] The RPD found that it was not plausible that Mr. XXXX coworker would come to his home and brag about his role in assisting the Governor in illegally importing firearms. The RPD found that this was implausible and inconsistent with county conditions. The RPD noted that the Governor was a powerful person and was already accused of weapon smuggling. However, in coming to its conclusion the RPD failed to indicate how this led to the determination that the scenario ran contrary to country conditions. The RPD then concluded on a balance of probabilities that the Principal Appellant used an existing story to bolster his claim.\n[7] I find that the record does not support the implausibility finding of the RPD. Although there is a credibility concern that the Principal Appellant was unaware of the Governor's legal troubles, including an investigation into illegal firearm activities, despite that it was publicly reported does not make the event described by the Appellant implausible. I find that the RPD erred in coming to the conclusion that it was contrary to country conditions without explaining how it reached this determination. I do not see anything in the record that suggests that corruption and criminal activities carried out by customs officers is contrary to the country conditions in Nigeria. To the contrary, in the case at hand the documentary evidence indicates that in fact the Governor was involved in illegal activities and had used his \"thugs\" to intimidate people in the community.2 The evidence suggests that this was reported by the press and well known in the community. Given that this was public knowledge, I find that it is not implausible that someone assisting the Governor in his illegal activities might share this information with a friend in an attempt to try to recruit them into participating. As such, I find that the RPD's implausibility finding is an error regarding the allegation of Mr. XXXX.\nThe Associate Appellant's allegation\n[8] The RPD found that the allegations of Mrs. XXXX were also implausible. In support of this finding, the RPD points to inconsistencies between her Basis of Claim Form (BOC) and her testimony at the hearing. The RPD points out that Mrs. XXXX indicated in her BOC that she had pornographic movies and magazines but at the hearing she testified that the magazines were actually photocopies of magazines that were stapled together. I find that the Mrs. XXXX description of the magazines was not in contradiction with her BOC. She maintained that she had pornographic magazines, simply adding that they were not originals during her testimony.\n[9] The Appellants also point out that in the reasons of the RPD, the responses of Mrs. XXXX on these issues is described as beginning with \"Oh!\" when in fact neither she nor the interpreter said \"Oh\" in her responses. I agree with the Appellants that Mrs. XXXX did not reply to the questions put to her with \"Oh!\" as indicated in the reasons. However, I would note that the reasons are an unedited transcript of the RPD essentially giving an oral decision in chambers. This variation is likely as a result of the way in which the reasons were dictated and not edited. In any event, I find that the Associate Appellant did not respond in this manner. Further, this is not a determinative issue in assessing the Associate Appellant's credibility or the plausibility of her allegations.\n[10] The RPD also found that there was an inconsistency with the information about where the pornographic materials were stored. In Mrs. XXXX narrative, she indicated that they were stored in a locked cabinet in \"our bedroom\"3 but at the hearing she testified that they were kept in a cabinet in her husband's room. I agree with the RPD that the testimony about the location of the pornography varied from the information in the BOC, however this inconsistency alone does not lead to a finding of implausibility of the entire allegation.\nThe family's passports and visas\n[11] The RPD found that the Associate Appellant's testimony about how the family was able to locate their passports after their home was ransacked by the Governor's thugs was inconsistent. The RPD found that the Associate Appellant adjusted her testimony about retrieving the passports as an attempt to respond to the RPD's concerns. I do not find that there were inconsistencies on this issue. The Principal Appellant's narrative indicated that his mother retrieved the family's passports from a safe in their home. The testimony before the RPD was consistent on these events. Therefore, I do not find that there was anything impugning the Associate Appellant's testimony on how the passports were retrieved.\n[12] I find that although there were some inconsistencies in the information provided by Mrs. XXXX, these inconsistencies were relatively minor and do not render her story implausible. The RPD failed to explain how these inconsistencies lead to the conclusion that the story in its entirety was implausible. There is no reliable evidentiary basis in the record to support this conclusion.4 I therefore find the plausibility finding of the RPD to be an error.\nWhy the claims must be returned to the RPD\n[13] The RPD found that the events as described by the Appellants were implausible and therefore concluded that they had not credibly established their allegations. The plausibility findings are not supported by the record. As these findings lead to the determination that the claims were entirely not credible, setting them aside leads me to grant the appeal. Despite this, I find that it would be inappropriate to substitute a decision in this matter.\n[14] There were a number of issues that were not canvassed at the RPD that need to be properly addressed before finalizing the claims. This includes the history of Mrs. XXXX in the United Kingdom and her re-availment to Nigeria on two occasions despite already facing difficulties regarding her sexual orientation beginning in 2001. Further, Mrs. XXXX indicated in her narrative and her Schedule A form that she was convicted and served a sentence of approximately XXXX months in the United Kingdom in 2005 for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. This information should be fully canvassed at the RPD to allow for a determination about any possible exclusion on the basis of article 1F(b) of the Refugee Convention.\nSupport letters\n[15] The Appellants have also argued that the RPD made an error in assessing the letters of support. While I agree that the RPD gave them little weight with limited reasoning, I will not reweigh them as this is not determinative of the appeal. Further, since the matter is being referred back to a differently constituted panel, that panel should assess the letters after considering the claims and Appellants' testimony afresh.\nCONCLUSION\n[16] The appeal is allowed.

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX (the \"Appellant\") is a citizen of India. He is appealing a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) denying his claim for protection on the basis that he was found not credible.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] The Appeal is dismissed.\nBACKGROUND AND ALLEGATIONS\n[3] The Appellant is a citizen of India. The Appellant alleges that he entered into a relationship with a woman (the \"Girlfriend\") in a lower caste, in Punjab State, without the blessing of the Girlfriend's family.\n[4] The Appellant was attacked on two occasions by the Girlfriend's brother and some associates. The police in the area refused to offer the Appellant protection.\n[5] The Appellant fled to New Delhi where he lived for a month without incident. The Appellant then came to Canada where he made his claim for protection.\n[6] At the RPD Hearing, the RPD Member and Appellant's Counsel agreed that there was no nexus to the Refugee Convention. This is also not raised as an appeal issue here by the Appellant. Therefore, the only ground being advanced is as a person in need of protection under s.97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)1.\n[7] The RPD rejected the claim on the basis the Appellant had not established that he still faced a risk to his life, of torture, or of cruel and unusual treatment. The RPD also found that the Appellant had safe and reasonable Internal Flight Alternatives (IFAs) to New Delhi, Mumbai, Goa, or Chennai.\nNO NEW EVIDENCE OR ORAL HEARING\n[8] The Appellant did not submit any new evidence to be considered under s.110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).2 No analysis of new evidence is therefore required.\n[9] As an oral hearing can only be held where there is new evidence that has been admitted under s.110(4), and since there is no new evidence in this case, no oral hearing is required.\nISSUES IN APPEAL\n[10] The Appellant argued the following issues in his appeal:\n(a) The RPD erred by finding the Appellant had a safe and reasonable IFA.\n(b) The RPD erred in its analysis of the Appellant's evidence and the risk to life, threat of torture, or cruel and unusual treatment.\n[11] I find the following issues to be determinative:\n(a) Whether the Appellant faces, on a balance of probabilities, a risk to life, torture, or cruel and unusual treatment.\n(b) IFA.\nANALYSIS\n[12] I have conducted an independent analysis of the evidence concerned, including reviewing the RPD hearing, as well as considering the Appellant's Memorandum,3 the RPD Decision,4 and the Appellant's Basis of Claim (BOC) form,5 amongst other documents.\nAppellant does not face a future risk to life, risk of torture, or cruel and unusual treatment\n[13] The RPD noted that since the Appellant's contact with the Girlfriend ended on XXXX XXXX 2019, he has received no news about her, and made no attempts to even re-establish contact with her. Furthermore, the RPD noted that the Appellant was able to live for a month in New Delhi without incident, including receiving no threats.\n[14] The Appellant has argued that the RPD has \"failed to understand the gravity of [his] situation\"6. However, he then just reiterates his claim as being in danger because the relationship was between members of two different castes, the fact there was pre-marital sex, and the fact the relationship was not arranged or authorised by her parents.\n[15] The Appellant has not addressed the issue that he needs to establish that he faces, on a balance of probabilities (not reasonable likelihood, as we are considering s.97 only, and not s.96), a risk to his life, a risk of torture, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment.\n[16] Before me, I have no evidence that there have been threats to the Appellant since at least XXXX 2019 when the Appellant was in New Delhi. The Appellant is no longer in contact with the Girlfriend, which was what the Girlfriend's family members wanted to achieve.\n[17] This absence of evidence means that, on a balance of probabilities, he does not face a risk to his life, a risk of torture, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment. I find the RPD did correctly find this to be the case and I uphold these findings accordingly.\nAppellant has suitable IFAs\n[18] The RPD also found that in any case, the Appellant also had safe and reasonable IFAs including New Delhi, Mumbai, Goa, and Chennai. As part of this, the RPD noted that the Appellant was able to live in New Delhi for a month without incident.\n[19] The Appellant has argued that the RPD misconstrued his evidence in relation to living in New Delhi, and that as he changed his appearance, he was in hiding. The Appellant then cited the case of Zaytoun,7 which states that if a claimant or appellant has to hide in the IFA, this does not then constitute a reasonable IFA.\n[20] I note that the circumstances in Zaytoun are quite different to those in this case. In Zaytoun, the appellant was a Lebanese Shiite Muslim who was being asked to relocate to a Christian part of Lebanon. There, the Federal Court noted that Mr. Zaytoun would have to hide his Muslim identity from almost all of his neighbours who were Christian. This is a far cry from the Appellant in our case, who is one person, who is of no interest to the vast majority of the 11 to 18 million people living in New Delhi,8 a population equivalent to or even greater than Ontario's, in one city.\n[21] The Appellant grew a beard and started wearing a turban, but this is all the \"hiding\" he has testified to. This is far less onerous than the hiding in the Zaytoun case, which in that case, would also infringe on Mr. Zaytoun's freedom of religion. No such infringement on a fundamental right exists in our case here.\n[22] The Appellant has testified that his agents of persecution could locate him via police registration. However, I note that even with such registration, the system appears to be deficient in actually accomplishing citizen tracking and identity checking.\n[23] Of particular note is the Response to Information Request (RIR) on police surveillance.9 The database being rolled out across India has \"...yet to become operational in the sense that the police are still not able to trace a person based upon information collected under this project.\"10 Furthermore, the database itself appears to be deficient. \"[T]he 'police force is just ill-equipped and short-staffed to actually carry out such verifications when they get over 50 forms daily' (The Indian Express 11 Dec. 2017). According to the Associate Professor, '[i]nformation about tenants is very limited and Delhi\/Mumbai and a few other metropolises have intermittently tried to develop a database and verify the information. To the best of [his] knowledge, this is very inadequate and not updated regularly'.\"11\n[24] Furthermore, \"[p]olice surveillance databases are classified and not shared across states. Concerned officers can seek information through normal official channels.\"12 This further undermines the Appellant's allegation that the agents of persecution would be able to locate him through a police database.\n[25] I therefore find that the RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant has safe IFAs in any of New Delhi, Mumbai, Goa, or Chennai.\n[26] In relation to the reasonableness prong, I note that a lack of family support does not then create a hardship situation so great as to render any of the proposed IFAs unreasonable. Indeed, as pointed out by the RPD, the Appellant has no such supports in Canada either.\n[27] The RPD was correct to point out the Appellant has been educated to a post-secondary level, improving his ability to live in any of the proposed IFAs.\n[28] I find that the Appellant has not established that any of the IFAs are unreasonable. I find the RPD was correct in finding that any of the aforementioned IFAs are reasonable ones.\n[29] I find the RPD was correct and did not err in finding that any of New Delhi, Mumbai, Goa, or Chennai constitute safe and reasonable IFAs.\nCONCLUSION\n[30] Pursuant to s.111(1)(a) of the IRPA, the RPD's decision that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection is confirmed.\n[31] The appeal is dismissed.\n(signed)\nT.

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] These are my reasons for allowing the appeal XXXX XXXX XXXX (Mr. K). After independently reviewing the record I find that the Refugee Protection Division's (RPD) is incorrect, and that Mr. K is a Convention refugee.\nBACKGROUND\n[2] Mr. K is a Pakistani national who fears persecution by the Taliban because of his political opinions. He was an active member, and General Secretary of the Union Council, of the Awami National Party (ANP), which promoted education and equal opportunities for girls. This made him a target of the Taliban. In 2015, Mr. K began receiving letters from the Taliban warning him that if he did not stop his political activities, then he and his family would be killed. He received another letter in XXXX 2016 after urging people to join the ANP and be against the Taliban. Despite these threats he continued with his activities. Mr. K received several more threatening letters and phone calls throughout 2017. On XXXX XXXX, 2018, he received a letter saying he had exceeded his warnings. He then noticed that cars were following him and, on one occasion, opened fire on him. Mr. K reported the incident to the police, but they would not take action against the Taliban. He went into hiding, then traveled to Thailand where he met with an agent who arranged a fraudulent Thai passport under the alias XXXX XXXX XXXX. Using that document, Mr. K went to the USA before coming to Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2018.\n[3] The Minister intervened on paper in Mr. K's hearing, providing evidence that his alias had been used thrice before 2018 in separate applications for Canadian visas. On the basis of this and biometric evidence indicating that Mr. K had been fingerprinted in XXXX in early XXXX 2018, the Minister challenged Mr. K's identity and the credibility of the 2018 events.\n[4] The RPD rejected Mr. K's claim on August 12, 2019. It found that he was generally consistent in his testimony, detailed and spontaneous in his evidence about his political involvement and opinions, and that his allegation that the Taliban would not approve of a girls' school was objectively well-founded. Nevertheless, the RPD found that credibility was determinative, and that Mr. K's identity was an issue. The RPD did not accept Mr. K's explanation for the previous use of his alias on visa applications to Canada. It found that his testimony was inconsistent regarding the timing of the threats, and the availability of online media in his village. The RPD found that Mr. K's Thai passport had not been proven fraudulent and reasoned that this made it possible that the narrative events from 2013 onward may be fabricated. The RPD declined to give weight to Mr. K's supporting evidence, such as a letter from the ANP because it did not have the party logo, and found that his photos neither established his residence in Pakistan nor the nature of his interaction with political officials.\nArguments on appeal\n[5] Mr. K argues that the RPD erred by concluding, without evidence, that he lived and was employed in Thailand and made multiple attempts to come to Canada using his Thai passport. He argues that the RPD was wrong to discount his explanations about the previous visa applications under the same alias. Mr. K further argues that the RPD erred in its treatment of his supporting documents, namely the letter from the ANP leader, his ANP identity card, and the threat letter from the Taliban. He contends that the RPD was wrong to demand that the Taliban's letter contain security features, and that the RPD minimized the risk he faces.\n[6] Mr. K has submitted new evidence and he requests an oral hearing.\nROLE OF THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION (RAD)\n[7] I have applied the standard of correctness while reviewing the RPD decision and have conducted an independent assessment of the evidence before me.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[8] Mr. K has produced a number of documents to corroborate his Pakistani identity and his involvement in the ANP. These include the following:\na. New National Identity card;1\nb. New Pakistani passport;2\nc. Birth certificate;3\nd. Family registration certificate;4\ne. Domicile certificate;5\nf. School certificates;6\ng. Bank account book;7\nh. Photos taken between XXXX and XXXX 2015;8\ni. Hotel invoice for a stay in Peshawar from XXXX XXXX-XXXX, 2017;9\nj. Purchase and sale agreement for car in XXXX 2017;10\nk. Hospital discharge card for treatment from XXXX XXXX-XXXX XXXX 2017;11\nl. Letters from the XXXX XXXX XXXX of the ANP;12 and\nm. Screenshot of a tweet regarding threats from the Taliban to an ANP member.13\n[9] According to the law,14 I can only accept this evidence if it: (i) arose after the RPD decision; or (ii) was not reasonably available at the time of the decision; or (iii) that could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have been given to the RPD before it made its decision. If the evidence meets one or more of these requirements, I must decide if the evidence is new, credible and relevant before I can accept it.15 For the following reasons, I am only accepting some of these documents.\nRejected: Items (c)-(g)\n[10] Mr. K arrived in Canada with neither his original Pakistani passport, nor his false Thai one. He was also represented by counsel throughout the process of preparing his refugee claim. As a result, Mr. K would have known that his identity was an issue that required establishing. Given the importance of his identity to his claim, and the absence of his Pakistani passport, I find it would have been reasonable for Mr. K to provide copies of his bank book, or his birth, family registration, domicile and school certificates to establish his identity. During his RPD hearing, Mr. K was asked multiple questions about his identity, his use of an alias and of the Thai passport. He was clearly made aware that his identity was an issue at that time. His claim was rejected three weeks later. I find that this presented sufficient time for Mr. K to obtain the copies of these documents that he has now produced on appeal. He has not provided any reasons why he was unable to get these documents to the RPD before it reached its decision. Having found that these documents were reasonably available to Mr. K to provide before the RPD's decision was made, I find these documents are inadmissible.\nAdmitted: items (a), (b), (h)-(m)\n[11] Items (a) and (b), are the national identity card and Pakistani passport that Mr. K provided are both new, issued in 2019, after the RPD reached its decision. As such I find that they are new and that they could not have been provided prior to the decision being made. I further find these documents relevant and credible because they are issued by Pakistani authorities and serve to authenticate Mr. K's Pakistani citizenship.\n[12] The RPD did not explicitly challenge Mr. K on his location between 2013 and 2018. Although it asked when he went to Thailand and met with the agent, and why he first met the agent, Mr. K was not given a clear indication that the RPD did not believe that he was in Pakistan at the relevant time. As a result, I find that Mr. K could not have known that additional evidence beyond what he had already provided might be necessary. For this reason, although the photos, hotel invoice, purchase and sale agreement, and the hospital discharge card (Items (h)-(k)) were available to him before the RPD made its decision, I find that Mr. K could not reasonably have been expected, under the circumstances to have submitted them. I find these documents therefore bring new evidence to the appeal that is relevant in establishing Mr. K's residence in Pakistan during the material times. I find the evidence is prima facie credible. The photos are accompanied by date, time and location stamps. The hotel invoice and hospital record come from independent third parties, and the purchase and sale agreement are witnessed and signed by multiple independent parties.\n[13] The letters from the XXXX XXXX XXXX of the ANP,16 Mr. XXXX XXXX XXXX are dated XXXX XXXX, 2019, and therefore post-date the RPD decision. I accept these letters into evidence because they directly address issues raised by the RPD member during the hearing. The first letter corroborates the explanation provided by Mr. K during the hearing about the differences in party letterheads, and which the RPD dismissed in its decision. I find that Mr. K could not have reasonably known at that time that his explanation was not accepted and that this corroborative evidence was necessary. The second letter confirms Mr. K's participation and role in the ANP, and highlights the targeting of members, including the murder of local President a few months prior. Mr. K provided a letter to the RPD which was given no weight due to perceived irregularities with the letterhead. Given that Mr. K could not have known that his previous letter would be given no weight I find that he could not have known that this additional letter might be necessary. I therefore find that both of these letters bring new and credible evidence since they come from a party official with higher standing than the author of the letter that was before the RPD. I find these letters very relevant in assessing the credibility of Mr. K's involvement with the ANP and the risk he faces.\n[14] Finally, Mr. K provided a screenshot of a tweet by VOA Deewa,17 a Pakistani news agency reporting threats by the Taliban against Mr. XXXX XXXX XXXX, the author of the ANP letters in item (l). Included in the tweet is a photo of the threat by the Taliban which Mr. K argues is evidence that the threat letter he received is not unusual or fraudulent. I find that, because Mr. K did not know until the RPD made its decision that it had issues with the source and authenticity of the threat letter he submitted, he could not have known to provide corroborative evidence about the letter itself. I find this evidence is new and credible and relevant to determining the genuineness of the threat letter issued to Mr. K, because it relates to the experience of similarly situated persons and comes from an independent reporting agency.\n[15] Additionally, while I have admitted some of Mr. K's new evidence into the record, I do not find that any of these documents raise a serious issue regarding his credibility. Therefore, I will not be holding a hearing.\nANALYSIS\n[16] I have independently reviewed the evidence and I find that the RPD erred. The primary error and one which I find sufficient to set aside the decision, is that the RPD made its decision without ever making a clear determination about Mr. K's identity and location. The RPD began the hearing by stating that identity was not technically an issue in that Mr. K's name was accepted as his real name, but that his identity documents raised concerns.18 The RPD had before it, in the Minister's evidence,19 a photo of Mr. K's old Pakistani passport, his national identity card, and driver's license. In its decision, however, the RPD states that there is no evidence that the Thai passport under Mr. K's alias was fake.20 The implication of this statement is a belief that if the passport were genuine, then Mr. K would be the legitimate holder, with genuine Thai citizenship since passports are not issued to temporary residents. The RPD also reasoned that, if the passport were genuine, then it was possible that the events from 2013 onward did not happen. The RPD did not make a finding on the issue but calls Mr. K's credibility into doubt on the basis of this possibility. I find this is a significant error because it is a credibility finding that goes to the absolute heart of Mr. K's claim.\n[17] Additionally, the RPD essentially stated that it believes Mr. K is who he claims to be, but that he could also be someone else who has Thai citizenship. The problem is that this cannot be possible. Pakistan does not allow for dual citizenship with Thailand.21 This means that if the RPD accepted that the Thai passport was genuine and properly issued to Mr. K, it would be accepting that he is not a Pakistani citizen since he cannot have dual citizenship in these countries. These contradictory statements by the RPD lead to a foundationally illogical decision. By failing to make a concrete finding on Mr. K's identity, and consequently his location at the relevant time, the RPD failed to assess his claim. For these reasons, I overturn the RPD's decision.\n[18] As my reasons will explain below, I find that the evidence establishes that Mr. K was present in Pakistan for some of the relevant time, and that his involvement with the ANP and the school permitting girls' education makes him a target of the Taliban.\nMr. K's identity is established.\n[19] As I have noted above, Mr. K cannot have dual citizenship in both Pakistan and Thailand. He must be a citizen of only one country. I find, based on the evidence that was presented to the RPD, and on the basis of his new Pakistani ID card and passport, that he is, in fact, a Pakistani national. Flowing from that, I further find that Mr. K therefore did possess a fraudulent Thai passport under an alias.\nMr. K's whereabouts between 2011 and 2018\n[20] The Minister raised compelling concerns about the credibility of Mr. K's evidence of threats against his life in 2018. Most notable is the Minister's evidence that Mr. K's Thai alias was used prior to 2018 on three separate visa applications to Canada, and that he provided his fingerprints for his visa application to the US on XXXX XXXX, 2018,22 rather than in XXXX.\nMr. K was not in Pakistan in late 2018\n[21] The date of fingerprinting is very significant because it places Mr. K in Bangkok nearly one month before he states he received his last threat letter. In his testimony, Mr. K repeated that he went to XXXX in XXXX. I find that this is directly contradicted by the fingerprint evidence.\n[22] Although Mr. K provided photos of himself with ANP members in XXXX 2018, I note that the date is handwritten, not automatically or independently generated. In the face of the contradiction with the fingerprinting, I do not find the photos sufficient to establish that Mr. K was in Pakistan in XXXX 2018. I find that these photos could have been taken at any time, including earlier in 2018, and that they do not establish, on a balance of probabilities, that Mr. K was living in Pakistan in XXXX 2018.\n[23] As a result, I find that the evidence does not overcome the credibility concerns regarding Mr. K's testimony and narrative evidence about threats from the Taliban in late 2018. I find, based on the fingerprint evidence that Mr. K was not in Pakistan in XXXX beyond XXXX XXXXor XXXX of 2018, and that the events of XXXX 2018 did not occur. I find that these were fabricated to bolster his claim and I draw a negative credibility inference.\nEvents between 2011 and XXXX 2018\n[24] When asked about the two previous visa applications to Canada using the same Thai alias, Mr. K explained that he did not know, and speculated that the agent may have made the applications on his own. In his memorandum, counsel for Mr. K argues that it is not unreasonable that an agent might have used the passport to try to get a Canadian visa and then sell it. While I find it unlikely, I find that all of this is speculation about the motivations of a third party whose thoughts we cannot access.\n[25] The notes from the Canadian visa applications indicate that visa officers had concerns about Mr. K's activities in Thailand. I note that the visa applications indicate that Mr. K was married to a Pakistani woman and has two children. The visa officer on this application noted that his bank account balance was not steady, and that little evidence was given to establish that Mr. K was actually engaged in the business activities in Thailand that he claimed to be engaged in..23\n[26] The new evidence that Mr. K provided place him in Pakistan in XXXX XXXX XXXX 2015,24 XXXX 2015,25 XXXX 2017,26 and XXXX 2017.27 In addition to this new evidence, I have before me an agreement to donate property in 2011 for the purpose of establishing a school.28 I note, however that the translation is uncertified but I find the credibility concerns offset by the letter from Save the Children, confirming the same agreement.29 Finally, I also have before me, a letter from the Battagram ANP District XXXX confirming Mr. K's involvement and role as General Secretary in 2015,30 his ANP membership card,31 and a threat letter from the Taliban dated XXXX 2015.32 All of these documents place Mr. K in Pakistan. Considered collectively I find that these documents establish, on a balance of probabilities that Mr. K was in Pakistan at the relevant times between 2011 and early XXXX 2018.\n[27] I accept the possibility that Mr. K traveled during this time to Thailand in order to make applications for visas to Canada. However, considered alongside the evidence of threats against his life between 2015 and 2017, and noting that the girls' school was established in 2011, I find it makes sense that Mr. K might have tried to leave Pakistan at an earlier time.\n[28] Although I find his credibility diminished by the fabrication of events in 2018, I find that Mr. K's other allegations are credibly established on a balance of probabilities. Based on my review of his testimony and his supporting documents,33 I find that Mr. K's evidence was generally consistent and that his testimony about his political involvement and opinions, and reasons for supporting the establishment of a girls' school was spontaneous and detailed. I find that, with the exception of his testimony about the 2018 incidents, and, to a certain degree his testimony about the Canadian visa applications, Mr. K was generally credible. I find that he has established the truth of his allegations on a balance of probabilities.\nRisk from the Taliban is objectively well-founded\n[29] It is well documented that the Taliban oppose the education of girls and target schools where girls are education to demonstrate their opposition.34 Members of the ANP have also been targets of violence.35 Due to Mr. K's ANP membership and his role in supporting the creation and operation of a girls' school, it is not surprising that he would have become a target for the TTP. Mr. K has provided a threat letter that he received on XXXX XXXX, 2015.36 He has also provided proof that others in his party have been threatened.37 The country documents also establish that the Pakistani state cannot protect against these threats and dangers posed by the Taliban.38\nNo Internal Flight Alternatives (IFA) are available\n[30] Because the state is unable to protect Mr. K against threats by the Taliban, and because the Taliban operates throughout the country, I find that there are no IFAs available to Mr. K\n[31] In light of all of the above, I find, that Mr. K faces a serious possibility of persecution in Pakistan.\nCONCLUSION\n[32] The appeal is allowed. I substitute my own decision that Mr. K is Convention refugee.\n(signed)\nDilani Mohan\nDecember 17, 2020\nDate\n31Ibid., at pages 120-121.\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD File \/ Dossier de la SAR : VB9-06635\nRAD.25.02 (January, 2020)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n2\nImmigration and Refugee\nBoard of Canada\nRefugee Appeal Division\nCommission de l'immigration\net du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 du Canada\nSection d'appel des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s\nRAD.25.02 (January, 2020)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n",

The Appeal is allowed.\nBACKGROUND\n[3] The Appellant, a 38 year old male, is a Sunni Muslim. He alleges that he was born in Lebanon as a Palestinian refugee and remained there until 1998, when he moved to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). He worked as an XXXX XXXX and opened XXXX XXXX XXXX business of which he owned 23% shares, and a UAE national owned the controlling interest as per the UAE laws.\n[4] The Appellant was not politically active in the UAE but he often spoke against the Hezbollah, a powerful Shiite organization in Lebanon, in the company of his friends and associates.\n[5] On XXXX XXXX, 2012, he went to Beirut in Lebanon with the plan to spend a month with his sister and do some business also. The very next day he was kidnapped, blindfolded and kept in an unknown location for one day. During his detention, he was beaten and interrogated about some Lebanese Shia men who were deported from the UAE back to Lebanon. The issue was whether the Appellant had informed the UAE security service about these men. He was told by the Hezbollah to stay away from all Shiite Muslims in the UAE. He left Lebanon shortly after his release on XXXX XXXX, 2013 to return to the UAE.\n[6] He reported this incident to the UAE security service who called him a few days later and told him to become an informant for them for an Iraqi Shiite friend of the Appellant.\n[7] He talked to his brother in Canada who told him to come to Canada.\n[8] He is afraid to return to the UAE believing that they will deport him to Lebanon where he fears persecution or harm from the Hezbollah group.\n[9] The Appellant was represented by counsel at his hearing before the RPD Panel.\n[10] In its Reasons for Decision, the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) found that the Appellant was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. In arriving at its decision, the RPD made the following findings:\n1. The Appellant is credible. \"I have found the claimant to be straightforward and honest; there were times when he could have embellished and he did not and I do find him to be credible.1\"\n2. The RPD also found the Appellant to be a stateless Palestinian. The RPD also found that he had two countries of former habitual residence - Lebanon and the UAE.\n3. The RPD decision also makes a finding that \"He is at risk in Lebanon; he has a well-founded fear of persecution in Lebanon.2\"\n4. The RPD rejected his claim on the grounds that the Appellant's visa to enter UAE was valid on the day of the hearing and thus the Appellant could enter the UAE and continue with his business. The RPD also found that in the UAE, \"There is not a serious possibility that Hezbollah or Shiites or the state would persecute him or he would be subjected to torture, death, or cruel and unusual treatment of punishment.\" \"The fact that I could not see any real risk from Hezbollah means we do not really have to consider what the issue of state control or protection would be.3\"\n[11] The Appellant argued in its pleadings submitted, dated August 14, 2013, that:\n* the RPD erred in making a transparently \"unreasonable decision;4\" and,\n* that the RPD \"erred by its failure to specifically analyze the Appellant's claim for protection (UAE) under s. 97 of the IRPA5\"; and that,\n* the panel erred \"by its failure to differentiate between the tests required by sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA as it considered the Appellant's subjective fear in the determination of his s.97 claim6\"; and that,\n* \"the RPD panel failed to refer to or give any weight to pivotal documentary evidence before it, which amply supported the fact that Palestinians experience ill-treatment in the UAE as corroborated by RPD Information Request #ARE7244 which was filed in evidence by the Appellant's former counsel.7\" The Appellant also argues that the RPD Panel improperly made selective use of evidence which led to erroneous finding of fact.\n[12] The Appellant asks the RAD that the appeal be allowed and seeks the following relief: set aside the RPD's decision and refer the matter back to the RPD for the claim to be reheard by a differently constituted panel. In the alternative, the Appellant wants the RAD to replace the RPD determination with a determination that the Appellant is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\nNew Evidence - s. 110(4).\n[13] Pursuant to subsection 110(4) of the IRPA, the Appellant submitted his own affidavit,8 sworn on August 15, 2013, that states that his status in the UAE was as a worker and thus a temporary resident and, as such, if he remained outside the UAE for more than six months, he would lose his status. This is confirmed by objective documentary evidence of the Board which states that, \"Residence permit holders have the right to re-enter the UAE as often as desired, provided that they do not remain out of the country for an uninterrupted period extending six months. Residence permits are cancelled when permit holders remain out of the UAE for an uninterrupted period longer than six months\".9 He further states that he left the UAE on XXXX XXXX, 2013 and thus the allowed six-month period expired on XXXX XXXX, 2013 and, as such, he has no legal rights to return to the UAE, and that his wife and children are in hiding in the UAE.\n[14] The Appellant's affidavit is nothing more than a vehicle to attempt to introduce new documents into evidence. The new documents that were provided as post-hearing evidence are the correspondence10 he received from his partner in the UAE, a national of the UAE, dated XXXX XXXX, 2013. This includes a notification from his partner that UAE Intelligence visited him to enquire about the Appellant and his whereabouts, and before they left they informed him that his \"residency in the Emirates has been cancelled\", and that, should he return, he \"will be deported to Lebanon.11\"\nAdmissibility of Evidence Presented on Appeal\n[15] I have to decide whether to accept this correspondence as new evidence. Subsection 110(4) of the Act provides direction in that regard and it reads as follows:\nOn appeal, the person who is the subject of the appeal may present only evidence that arose after the rejection of their claim or that was not reasonably available, or that the person could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection.\n[16] The Appellant cites Raza,12 where the court posed the following questions that need to be asked in deciding whether to accept new evidence for a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment case. The RAD is aware that Raza is the leading case on \"new\" evidence, and agrees with the Appellant that this case is relevant because subsection 110(4) and paragraph 113(a) (the provision at issue in Raza) are similarly worded.\n[17] Therefore, the RAD applied Raza in considering whether to accept new documents into evidence. Those were provided to the RAD after the RPD decision. In Raza, the court summarized the key questions to ask, these are:\n1. Credibility: Is the evidence credible, considering its source and the circumstances in which it came into existence? If not, the evidence need not be considered.\n2. Relevance: Is the evidence relevant to the PRRA application, in the sense that it is capable of proving or disproving a fact that is relevant to the claim for protection? If not, the evidence need not be considered.\n3. Newness: Is the evidence new in the sense that it is capable of:\n(a) proving the current state of affairs in the country of removal or an event that occurred or a circumstance that arose after the hearing in the RPD; or,\n(b) proving a fact that was unknown to the refugee claimant at the time of the RPD hearing; or,\n(c) contradicting a finding of fact by the RPD (including a credibility finding)?\nIf not, the evidence need not be considered.\n4. Materiality: Is the evidence material, in the sense that the refugee claim probably would have succeeded if the evidence had been made available to the RPD? If not, the evidence need not be considered.\n5. Express statutory conditions:\n(a) If the evidence is capable of proving only an event that occurred or circumstances that arose prior to the RPD hearing, then has the applicant established either that the evidence was not reasonably available to him or her for presentation at the RPD hearing, or that he or she could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented the evidence at the RPD hearing? If not, the evidence need not be considered.\n(b) If the evidence is capable of proving an event that occurred or circumstances that arose after the RPD hearing, then the evidence must be considered (unless it is rejected because it is not credible, not relevant, not new or not material).\n[18] In light of the above, the RAD finds that the correspondence from his \"first partner and sponsor\" in the UAE submitted by the Appellant could not have been obtained with reasonable effort for the June 20 sitting of the hearing. I find it to be relevant and material as it confirms the claimant's statements about his residency status; the time he could stay out of the UAE; that he was not the primary partner in the business, and, more importantly, that the UAE Intelligence went to inquire about the Appellant on XXXX XXXX, 2007. This letter also confirms that, should he return, he would be deported to Lebanon. The RPD found the Appellant to be credible; therefore, I have no reasons to question the credibility of the documents. Moreover, they are consistent and corroborate the Appellants BOC narrative and his testimony. Therefore, I find that the new documents meet the conditions under subsection 110(4). I therefore accept these as new evidence in consideration of this Appeal.\n[19] The Appellant also cites Popov,13 where the court stated:\n[42] Although it is true that in Thabet,14 the Federal Court of Appeal creates a distinction between stateless individuals and those who do have a state, one must read further. The Court answered the certified question before it as follows:\nIn order to be found to be a Convention refugee, a stateless person must show that, on a balance of probabilities, he or she would suffer persecution in any country of former habitual residence, and that he or she cannot return to any of his or her countries of former habitual residence. (Thabet at paragraph 30) [emphasis added]\n[43] Thabet clearly sets out that it is not sufficient to simply be unable to return to all countries of former habitual residence - the individual must prove that they will suffer persecution in one of those countries.\n[44] In this case, Mr. Popov and Ms. Doubrovskaia, being stateless individuals, must establish that they would suffer persecution in either Russia or the United States - their countries of former habitual residence and that they cannot return to the other. Although it is clear they cannot return to Russia, they have made their claim against the United States and as such must prove that they would suffer persecution in that country.\n[45] In order to do so, they must prove not only a subjective fear but also an objective fear. This requires that they rebut the presumption of state protection and are \"required to prove that they exhausted all the domestic avenues available to them before without success before claiming refugee status in Canada.\" (Hinzman at paragraph 46).\nThe Determinative Issue\n[20] The determinative issue may now be rephrased as follows: is the Appellant a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection based on the RPD record, the Appellant's record, the Appellant's pleadings and the new evidence accepted pursuant to ss 110(4).\n[21] The RPD's negative determination was based on their finding that on the date of the hearing, the Appellant had the right to re-enter the UAE, one of the countries of his habitual residence where Hezbollah, the agent of persecution, could not persecute or harm him.\n[22] As stated earlier, the RPD found that the Appellant is a stateless person with the UAE and Lebanon as the two counties of habitual residence. The RPD also found the Appellant to be a credible witness who has a well-founded fear of persecution in Lebanon, one of the two countries of habitual residence. The Board also accepted that in the other country of habitual residence, the UAE where he is a person of interest for the UAE intelligence.\n[23] Since the RPD found that the Appellant was credible and therefore the RPD accepted his testimony that he is a person of interest to the UAE authorities who want him to spy for them and report to them the activities of one of his friends; he agreed to do so but fled.\n[24] Considering the totality of evidence before me, I note that the Board's objective evidence shows that there are reports of \"police and prison guard brutality\" and that \"arbitrary and incommunicado detention remained a problem15\" in the UAE.\n[25] Based on the foregoing, I find that, should the Appellant return to the UAE, there is a serious chance that he will be picked up by the authorities and thus may be victimized by police brutality or face arbitrary and incommunicado detention by the state agents. In the alternative, the UAE authorities will deport him to Lebanon where the RPD had already found him to have a well-founded fear of persecution in Lebanon.\n[26] The new evidence supported by objective documentary evidence shows that the Appellant has a fear of return to both the UAE and Lebanon.\n[27] Therefore, taking into consideration Popov, cited above, I find that the Appellant is a Convention refugee because he would suffer persecution in either UAE or Lebanon, his countries of former habitual residence, and he cannot return to either.\n[28] For these reasons, the negative determination of the RPD is set aside and I find that the Appellant is a Convention refugee as per s. 111(1)(b) of IRPA as he would face a serious possibility of persecution should he return to Lebanon or the UAE, both countries identified as countries of habitual residence.\n[29] Therefore, the Appeal is allowed. The Appellant is a Convention refugee.\n(signed)\n'Atam Uppal'\nAtam Uppal\nOctober 15, 2013\nDate\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD.25.02 (April 9, 2013)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\nRAD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SAR : TB3-05147\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] The Appellant, XXXX XXXX XXXX, is a citizen of Somalia and appeals a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) dated February 17, 2016, rejecting his claim for refugee protection. The Appellant is not requesting a new hearing and is not submitting new evidence in support of his appeal. The Appellant asks that the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) set aside the decision of the RPD and find that the Appellant is either a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection, or that the RAD refer the matter back to the RPD for reconsideration.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] Pursuant to section 111(1)(c) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), the RAD refers the matter to the RPD for re-determination by a differently-constituted panel.\nBACKGROUND\n[3] The Appellant alleges that he would suffer persecution or a risk to his life at the hands of the Habargadir clan and Al-Shabaab if he were to return to Somalia.\nROLE OF THE RAD\n[4] For questions of fact, mixed fact and law, and law, the RAD has applied the standard of correctness as per Huruglica.1 In assessing issues involving credibility of oral testimony, the RAD may apply the RAD's modified standard of reasonableness in those situations where the RPD enjoys a meaningful advantage in making credibility findings as per the decision in X (Re).2\nANALYSIS ON THE MERITS OF THE APPEAL\n[5] The RPD hearings took place on January 7, 2016 and January 28, 2016, with the decision rendered on February 17, 2016. The Appellant appealed the RPD's decision to the RAD and the RAD rendered a decision confirming the RPD's decision on September 28, 2016. The Federal Court, by a consent order dated January 16, 2017, returned the matter to the RAD.\n[6] The Appellant lived in XXXX, Somalia before embarking on a trip which took him to several countries, with his final destination of Canada. He alleges that he fears both the Habargadir clan and Al-Shabaab if he were to return to Somalia. The RAD wishes to raise the issue of Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) to the city of Mogadishu. Since this would involve credibility issues, the RAD will return the matter to the RPD with specific instructions.\nINSTRUCTIONS TO THE RPD\n[7] The RAD instructs the new panel of the RPD to raise and canvass the issue of whether there is a safe IFA for the Appellant in the city of Mogadishu.\nDECISION\n[8] Pursuant to section 111(1)(c) of the IRPA, the RAD refers the matter to the RPD for re-determination by a differently-constituted panel.\n[9] The Appeal is allowed.\n(signed)\n\"Pasquale Fiorino\"\nPasquale Fiorino\nJanuary 12, 2018\nDate\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD.25.02 (June 23, 2014)\nRAD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SAR : TB6-03557\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] The Minister (the \"appellant\") appeals the May 26, 2016 determination of the Refugee Protection Division (the \"RPD\"). The claim was heard by the RPD on the same day with a Notice of Decision being sent on June 24, 2016. The RPD found that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (the \"respondent\") is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the \"Act\" or \"IRPA\").1 The respondent is a citizen of Libya.\nDETERMINATION OF THE APPEAL\n[2] Pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the Act, the Refugee Appeal Division (the \"RAD\") confirms the determination of the RPD, namely, that the respondent is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Act. This appeal is therefore dismissed.\nBACKGROUND\n[3] Counsel for the respondent before the RAD is the same as he had at the RPD hearing. The Minister did intervene before the RPD by documents only.\n[4] A transcript2 has not been included for this RAD appeal.\n[5] The Minister has provided 'new evidence' pursuant to subsection 110(3).3\nBASIS OF CLAIM\n[6] According to the allegations set out in the respondent's Basis of Claim form (BOC),4 the respondent is from a rural village called XXXX, in the Warshafana region. He also has a family home in Tripoli where he lived during the week and went to his home village on the weekends. The respondent's XXXX served in the Gaddafi regime XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX until XXXX XXXX\n[7]\nThe respondent's problems began after Gaddafi fled Tripoli in August 2011. The Al Zawiya militia came to his family home in XXXX to check for weapons and to look for those who had supported Gaddafi. The militia came again to the family home in XXXX and were very intimidating. The respondent and his family moved to Tripoli. He believed his family was being targeted because XXXX XXXX is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[8] The respondent and his family remained in Tripoli but they feared the militia. The militia bombed and looted the Warshafana region in 2014. Prior to this attack, the respondent and his younger sister and mother planned to visit his younger brother in Canada who was studying. They applied for visitor visas in July of 2014 and were issued visas to Canada in August 2014.\n[9] The respondent made a claim for refugee protection in Canada.\nGROUNDS OF APPEAL\n[10] The Minister's submissions5 as to the grounds of this appeal can be summarized as follows:\n* Did the RPD member breach procedural fairness by not acknowledging the proposed IFA locations of Zintan and Tobruk either in her reasons or in her questioning of the respondent?\nREMEDY SOUGHT\n[11] The Minister requests6 that the RAD, under paragraph 111(1)(c) of the Act, set aside the determination of the RPD and refer it back to the RPD for re-determination.\n[12] The respondent requests7 that the RAD dismiss this appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD member in this matter.\nROLE OF THE RAD\n[13] Although the Act sets out grounds for appeal as well as possible remedies, it does not specify the standard of review to be applied by the RAD.\n[14] In the Federal Court of Appeal (FCA) decision for Huruglica8 Justice Gauthier states:\n[103] I conclude from my statutory analysis that with respect to findings of fact (and mixed fact and law) such as the one involved here, which raised no issue of credibility of oral evidence, the RAD is to review RPD decisions applying the correctness standard. Thus, after carefully considering the RPD decision, the RAD carries out its own analysis of the record to determine whether, as submitted by the appellant [respondent], the RPD erred. Having done this, the RAD is to provide a final determination, either by confirming the RPD decision or setting it aside and substituting its own determination of the merits of the refugee claim. It is only when the RAD is of the opinion that it cannot provide such a final determination without hearing the oral evidence presented to the RPD that the matter can be referred back to the RPD for redetermination. No other interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions is reasonable.\n[15] In Youkap,9 the Federal Court (Court) confirmed that the RAD may show a certain level of deference towards the RPD's finding when credibility issues are involved, and that the RAD must conduct an independent assessment of the evidence as a whole. Furthermore, the RAD has a duty of deference regarding the credibility findings of the RPD as the RPD has had the opportunity to hear the witness.10 This has also been stated by the recent FCA decision, Huruglica,11 where Justice Gauthier states:\n[11] [. . .] These respective roles suggest deference is owed to findings of fact, or findings of mixed fact and law, that can be traced back to evidence given at the RPD hearing. Where the RAD has new evidence before it, either through documents or from an oral hearing, less deference may be owed, as the RPD will not have considered this evidence.\n[. . .]\n[14] Turning to the expertise and advantageous position of the RPD versus that of the RAD, the RAD underlined that the RPD always has the advantage of seeing and questioning refugee claimants, while the RAD will unfrequently have this opportunity. This \"suggests that the RAD show deference to the RPD on findings of fact and particularly in respect to credibility, other than in situations where the RAD holds an oral hearing and therefore has opportunity to consider evidence first hand\": . . .12\n[16] In this appeal, and taking into consideration the recent FCA decision in Huruglica,13 with respect to findings of fact (and mixed fact and law), which raise no issue of credibility of oral evidence, the RAD is to review RPD decisions applying the correctness standard. Otherwise, where an issue concerning credibility of oral evidence is evident, I will be applying the points set out in Huruglica14 which is to conduct an independent assessment of all the evidence to determine whether the respondent is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection, while giving certain deference to the RPD's findings regarding the respondent's credibility and any other issues where the RPD enjoys a particular advantage. As well, it is clear from the many recent Court cases that have been previously mentioned, all agree that the standard of correctness should be used for any error of law found in the RPD decision on appeal to the RAD. Both will apply for this RAD appeal.\nANALYSIS OF THE MERITS OF THE APPEAL\n[17] The Minister submits that the RPD member's \"decision is unreasonable and does not provide a sufficient analysis on all the issues as it does not make clear findings on the issues of internal flight alternatives (IFA) as raised by the Minister\".15\n[18] I note that the Minister submitted written submissions to the RPD member regarding IFA and proposed two cities being Zintan and Tobruk16. I have listened to the CD of the RPD oral hearing and the pre-conference oral hearing in its entirety. I also note that the RPD member did not assess these proposed IFA locations either during the RPD hearing or in her reasons. It is important to understand some of the background regarding this refugee claim. On March 22, 2016, a different RPD member conducted a pre-hearing conference with the respondent, his counsel, and Minister's counsel. The purpose of this pre-hearing conference was to make the parties aware that the Minister was not compliant with Refugee Protection Division Rules 29(2)17 in IRPA in that the Minister did not indicate what his purpose was for intervening in the refugee protection claim for the respondent. The Minister was asked to present a notice of intervention stating the purpose to which the Minister will intervene. The Minister provided written submissions outlining the purpose of his intervention on May 26, 2016.18\n[19] On May 26, 2016, the refugee claim hearing for the respondent was heard by another RPD member. At this time, the RPD member did not acknowledge the Minister's submissions on the proposed IFA locations. Rather, the RPD member did purpose19 Tripoli as a possible IFA location and then asked the respondent's counsel if he could think of any other city that would be a suitable IFA. At no time did the RPD member mention the two cities proposed by the Minister in his written submissions.\n[20] The only reference to IFA in the RPD member's decision is the following:20\nThe UNHCR position on returns is that no one should be forcibly returned to Libya until the security and human rights situation has improved. Thus, I find that there is no Internal Flight Alternative in Libya.\n[21] The RPD member finds the respondent is a Convention refugee and does not have a viable IFA in his home country. However, the RPD member only considered Tripoli as a possible IFA city and ignored the Minister's written submissions proposing Zintan and Tobruk as viable IFA options.\n[22] The Minister submits that the RPD member's failure to assess the proposed cities of Tobruk and Zintan in her IFA analysis is a breach of procedural fairness and natural justice.21 The Minister also submits that \"addressing the issues surrounding the proposed IFA as raised by the Minister are essential in understanding the decision rendered by the RPD member. As a claimant must rebut the IFA, failing to include an analysis on the IFAs raised by the Minister renders the decision unintelligible\".22 The Minister submits that \"Conducting an analysis of a city [being Tripoli] that is impossible for the respondent to return to while ignoring cities that are affiliated with his tribe (Zintan and Tobruk) is an error in fact.\"23\n[23] The respondents submit that:\nIt was not necessary for the RPD member to explicitly analyze Zintan and Tobruk as internal flight alternative in the decision because the RPD member either dealt with the underlying reasons submitted by the respondent and found those reasons to be unfounded or the reasons were speculative and not supported in the evidence before the RPD member.24\n[24] The Court has said that the Minister is entitled to the same procedural fairness as a claimant and specifically notes that it is \"not a one-way right\".25 In Xu,26 the Court finds that \"The Board failed to analyse the credibility and identity concerns of the Minister and their impact on the finding of truthfulness.\" In the same way, I find the RPD member failed to address the Minister's written submissions regarding proposed IFA locations.\n[25] I find that this is a question of fact and law and thus I have conducted an independent assessment of all the evidence that was before the RPD and the RAD regarding IFA. I find that given the submissions from the Minister and responses from the respondent, combined with country documentation pertaining this issue, I agree with the Minister that the RPD member has breached procedural fairness.\n[26] The Federal Court has also made it clear in a number of cases that when assessing the credibility of a claimant, it is important to remember that all of the evidence, both oral and documentary, must be considered and assessed, not just selected portions of the evidence.27 I find that the RPD member has not adequately assessed all the evidence before her in finding the respondent to be a Convention refugee.\n[27] Unlike the Federal Court, the RAD has the jurisdiction to assess the evidence and come to its own determination given the facts surrounding the claim if oral testimony is not required. This was stated in the FCA case of Huruglica.28 Given that the RPD member breached procedural fairness in ignoring the Minister's submissions on IFA, I will conduct my own independent assessment of the evidence to determine whether, on a balance of probabilities, the respondent can live safely in the proposed cities of Zintan and Tobruk.\nPROFILE\n[28] Before assessing the proposed cities as viable IFA for the respondent, it is important to establish the respondent's profile as it relates to his alleged risk in Libya. The Minister submits that the \"XXXX XXXX is not listed in the NDP as perceived Gaddafi supporter\".29 The respondent submits \"it is incorrect that the XXXX XXXX is not listed in the NDP as a tribe of perceived Gaddafi loyalists\".30 The respondent refers to the following NDP report which notes \"shelling caused significant damage to civilian infrastructure, and led to casualties and displacement in the cities of Benghazi, Tripoli, and Warshafana where members of some communities have been accused of being supporters of the Qaddafi regime and have been victims of retaliatory attacks\".31 The respondent also points to another country report which states \"Warshafana [...] is an area perceived to be harbouring many Qadhafi supporters\".32\n[29] I note that the RPD member finds:33\nI find that there's a nexus of perceived political opinion based on nationality that is tribal affiliation. As the fighting rages in Libya between various sectarian groups, Libya has not forgotten Al Gaddafi, and those who supported him.\nI find your fear to be well-founded. I find that you listed several areas of concern where you have a well-founded fear. One concern being perceived to be anti-Gaddafi. And the other that you would be perceived to be pro-Gaddafi.\n[30] The RPD member also notes:34\nSo I find there's a well-founded fear that the claimant would be arrested, detained and tortured or disappeared right at the airport because of his name associating him with his tribe and the town which were considered to be pro-Gaddafi.\n[31] I have also conducted my own independent assessment of all the evidence before the RPD and the RAD. I agree with the RPD member that the respondent has established, on a balance of probabilities, that he is perceived to be a Gaddafi supporter in Libya. It is clear from the AR that the Minister concedes that the respondent is a member of the XXXX XXXX.35 I do not find the Minister has provided any arguments to contradict the RPD member's finding on the profile of the respondent. Through my own independent assessment of the evidence, I find no reasons to disagree with the RPD member's finding that the respondent does belong to the XXXX XXXX and is perceived to be pro-Gaddafi. Given this profile of the respondent, I will now assess whether it is safe for the respondent, on a balance of probabilities, to relocate to the proposed IFA locations of Zintan or Tubrok.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE (IFA)\n[32] The key concepts concerning IFA come from two cases: Rasaratnam36 and Thirunavukkarasu.37 The panel must be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that (1) there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted or, on the balance of probabilities, in danger of torture, subjected to a risk to life or to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture in the IFA38 and, (2) that conditions in that part of the country are such that it would be reasonable, in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for him to seek refuge there.39\n[33] The FCA has stated that one must first determine whether an IFA exists and then determine whether the IFA is a realistic, achievable option, given the particular circumstances of the individual.40 In Rasaratnam,41 the Court of Appeal held that, with respect to the burden of proof, once the issue was raised, the onus is on the claimant to show that he or she does not have an IFA. Furthermore, both prongs must be satisfied for a finding that the respondent has an IFA.\n[34] The RPD member, at the RPD hearing, only proposed Tripoli as an IFA for the respondent. Given that I find the RPD member did err in ignoring the Minister's submissions before the RPD hearing regarding the two proposed cities of Zintan and Tobruk, for this RAD appeal I will assess whether these two cities are viable options for the respondent. I have reviewed the Minister's submissions before the RPD, the Minister's submissions before the RAD, and the respondent's submissions before the RAD. I have also reviewed all the country documentation in reference to these two proposed cities. I have conducted my own independent assessment in making my finding.\n[35] The Minister submitted that \"as the conflict in Libya is multifaceted, the claimant must not face persecution from Libya Dawn or Al Zawiya (the original agent of persecution) and he must not be perceived to be a Gaddafi supporter in the area of relocation as this would also result in persecution. Secondly, the claimant must be able to travel to these areas without encountering great physical danger to undergo undue hardship in travelling or staying there. The Minister submits that the claimant can travel to Zintan overland through the Mashhad Salih border crossing with Tunisia or fly directly into Tobruk as the airport is operational\".42\n[36] The respondent submits that \"even if the appellant could demonstrate that Tobruk is safe for the respondent, the respondent would not be able to arrive in Tobruk without being exposed to a serious risk of harm. For an IFA to be viable, a claimant must be able to access the area of the IFA without undue risk to his or her life.\"43\n[37] It is clear that given the respondent's profile, the Minister accepts44 that Tripoli is not a viable IFA for the respondent. The country report submitted by the Minister for the RAD appeal states that \"there are only two flights per day to Tobruk, which both fly from Tripoli.\"45 The same report states that there are no international flights permitted for the Tobruk airport.46 Furthermore, the same report states that the \"status of the Tobruk airport is subject to change due to country circumstance\".47 The document48 the Minister referred to in his written submissions before the RPD did state that the Tobruk airport was operational but I note that that document was from 2014 and it is unclear as to whether international airlines are able to fly there. The most recent document submitted by the Minister is dated October 3, 2016.49\n[38] As for Zintan, the Minister submitted50 that the respondent can travel to Zintan overland through the Mashhad Salih border crossing with Tunisia. Again, the document referred to by the Minister is dated 2014. This document also states \"There are three border crossings with Tunisia. According to the Crisis Group, the tribal militias that are in control of border crossings and smuggling routes change regularly in function of the evolving security situation.\"51 In the most recent report submitted to the RAD, there is no new information regarding Zintan and the possibility of internal location for those fitting the profile of the respondent.\n[39]\nThe test for reasonableness is whether it would be unduly harsh to expect the claimant [respondents] to move to another, less hostile part of the country before seeking status abroad? Thirunavukkarasu52 sets a very high threshold for what makes an IFA unreasonable in all the circumstances. An IFA cannot be speculative or theoretical only; it must be a realistic, attainable option. The claimant cannot be required to encounter great physical danger or to undergo undue hardship in travelling there or staying there.53 Even if the respondent was able to live safely in the proposed cities, the question arises whether it would be safe for him to travel there. Given the objective evidence before the RAD, I do not find, on a balance of probabilities, that it would be safe for the respondent to travel to Zintan or Tobruk to seek a safe haven.\n[40] I note that refugee protection is forward-looking. I also note that the respondent is in Canada and would need to travel to the proposed IFA locations. Thus, I find that, given the evidence before the RPD and the RAD, I do not find that there was or is sufficient or persuasive evidence to conclude that the respondent can safely travel to the proposed IFA locations. I acknowledge that the situation in Libya is not the best and this is supported by the objective evidence on country conditions54 in Libya. Furthermore, evidence shows that the situation in Libya has worsened and there is a state of general lawlessness that now exists in Libya. Militia groups are arbitrarily persecuting and harming civilians in most of Libya with impunity. Therefore, it would not be reasonable in the circumstances to require the respondent to relocate to Zintan or Tobruk.\nCONCLUSION\n[41] I find the RPD member has erred in failing to provide the Minister with procedural fairness. However, in light of the evidence before the RPD and the RAD, and through my own independent assessment of the evidence, I find that there is, on a balance of probabilities, no internal flight alternative available for the respondent in Libya given his personal circumstances and his profile. Thus, I find that the respondent is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Act.\nREMEDY\n[42] For all these reasons, I confirm the determination of the RPD in accordance with paragraph 111(1)(a) of the Act, namely, that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is a Convention refugee.\n(signed)\n\"Rena Dhir\"\nFebruary 27, 2017\nDate\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SAR : VB6-02181\nRAD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SAR : VB6-02181\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] I dismiss this appeal. XXXX XXXX XXXX (Appellant) is a citizen of Tanzania.\n[2] The Appellant fears persecution on the basis of his sexual orientation as a gay man. The Appellant had an 11-year relationship with his same-sex partner, IJ. In XXXX 2019, the Appellant's partner was arrested because his name was sent to the governor as being gay. When the Appellant learned that the police also went to his house, he stayed in hiding until he left Tanzania.\n[3] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) found that the presumption of truthfulness was rebutted. The Appellant gave repetitive and vague testimony about his sexual orientation, and there was insufficient credible evidence to establish his alleged same-sex relationship. Inconsistencies and omissions in the Appellant's Basis of Claim form (BOC) narrative, his application forms and his testimony about his arrests were not reasonably explained. The Appellant failed to provide corroborative evidence about his same-sex partner's arrest. The subpoena and police order were given no weight. The Appellant's activities at the 519 and Access Alliance were insufficient to establish his sexual orientation.\n[4] The Appellant argues that the RPD erred by making adverse credibility findings based on minor omissions and inconsistencies. The Appellant also argues that the RPD erred by requiring the Appellant to provide corroborative evidence. The Appellant further argues that the RPD failed to apply the Chairperson's Guideline 9: Proceedings before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression (SOGIE Guideline)1 in assessing the Appellant's reluctance to provide details of his sexual orientation and his explanations for inconsistencies in his testimony and his narrative. The Appellant argues that the RPD erred by disregarding his evidence without apparent reason.\n[5] The determinative issue is credibility.\n[6] The RPD did not err in concluding that the Appellant gave vague, evolving and evasive testimony about his sexual orientation and his same-sex partner. Omissions and inconsistencies in the Appellant's narrative, his application forms, the police documents and his testimony are not reasonably explained and involve material aspects of the Appellant's claim.\nDECISION\n[7] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[8] The Appellant submitted the following as new evidence:\n(a) affidavit of the Appellant, dated February 26, 2021;\n(b) online article: \"Homophobic Tanzanians hit with last-minute U.S. visa restrictions\" published by Rights Africa on January 20, 2021;\n(c) online article: \"How Tanzania Is Cracking Down On LGBT People - And Getting Away With It\" published by BuzzFeedNews on April 8, 2017; and\n(d) online article: \"Tanzania: Obstructions to LGBT Health, Rights\" published by Human Rights Watch on February 3, 2020.\n[9] According to the Law,2 I can only accept evidence that:\n(i) arose after the RPD's decision; or\n(ii) was not reasonably available at the time of the decision; or\n(iii) that the Appellant could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to be brought to the RPD before the decision.\n[10] If the evidence meets one or more of these requirements, I must decide if the evidence is new, credible and relevant before I can accept it.3\nItem (a) is not admitted\n[11] The Appellant's affidavit4 was sworn on February 26, 2021. In his affidavit, the Appellant describes the result of the RPD hearing and repeats portions of his narrative and other evidence. The Appellant has not provided submissions as to why the affidavit should be admitted.\n[12] The content of the affidavit, except for describing the RPD's determination, is information that was in evidence before the RPD. As such, item (a) is not admitted.\nItem (b) is admitted\n[13] The article5 is dated January 20, 2021, and it describes sanctions imposed by the United States (U.S.) Secretary of State on Tanzanian officials for complicity in undermining the 2020 general elections held in Tanzania in October 2020 in which homosexuals were harassed. The article also describes a previous sanction by the U.S. Secretary of State that banned Paul Makonda, the administrative chief of Kampala, from visiting the U.S. in relation to his role in a crackdown on homosexuals in the capital city. The Appellant has provided no submissions as to why the article should be admitted.\n[14] The article contains information that arose after the RPD's decision on January 4, 2021. The information is new as it describes sanctions placed by the U.S. Secretary of State relating to Tanzanian government officials and their discrimination against homosexuals. The information is relevant to the country conditions in Tanzania on which the Appellant's claim is based. I have no concerns as to credibility as the article is published by a human rights media network. Item (b) is admitted.\nItems (c) and (d) are not admitted\n[15] Item (c) is an article dated April 8, 2017, which describes how the Tanzanian government is terrorizing LGBTQ individuals.6 Item (d) is an article dated February 3, 2020, which describes discriminatory health policies, raids and arrests on LGBTQ individuals by the Tanzanian government. The Appellant has not provided submissions as to why the articles should be admitted as new evidence.\n[16] The articles were published prior to the RPD's decision dated January 4, 2021; the information in the articles describe events that occurred before the RPD's decision. For these reasons, items (c) and (d) are not admitted.\nNO HEARING\n[17] The Appellant requests a hearing be held in the event that I have any concerns regarding the credibility of his evidence that may be determinative of his appeal.\n[18] I may only hold a hearing when I have admitted new evidence that raises a serious issue as to the credibility of the Appellant; when the issue is central to the decision; and if the evidence was accepted, would be determinative of the appeal.7 As the only new evidence I have admitted is a news article that has no relevance to the determinative issue of credibility, I have no jurisdiction to hold a hearing.\nANALYSIS\n[19] My role is to look at all of the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.8 Having reviewed the record and the transcripts of the hearing, I find that the RPD did not enjoy a meaningful advantage in assessing credibility. As a result, I am conducting my review on the standard of correctness.\n[20] In conducting my independent review, I am guided by the SOGIE Guideline.\nVague and evasive testimony\nThe Appellant's discovery of his sexual orientation\n[21] The RPD found that the Appellant's testimony about his sexual orientation was vague, repetitive and undetailed. The Appellant argues that he testified to his full knowledge and that the RPD erred by failing to apply the SOGIE Guideline, which indicates that some individuals have difficulty describing their sexual orientation with authority figures. I disagree.\n[22] The Appellant was asked to describe his sexual orientation, and he stated, \"[w]hen I see (inaudible) man, fellow man, who has big buttocks I'm attracted to him.\"9 The RPD then asked the Appellant to describe the feelings he had when he discovered his attraction to men:\nMEMBER: So can you describe the feelings that you had when you began to notice that you were attracted to men?\nCLAIMANT: So the feeling I get is when I see a man with buttocks I'm attracted to him and I cannot prevent myself from being attracted to him.\nMEMBER: So you've told me that the Tanzanian society discriminates against homosexuals so when you began to be attracted to men, you know, how did you deal with those conflicting feelings?\nCLAIMANT: I used to do that in secrecy so that the society would not recognize me.\nMEMBER: So you told me that when you see a man with large buttocks that you're attracted to him, when you were younger and first noticing other men did you have any other feelings?\nCLAIMANT: When we were young we used to do those things but in hiding, we used to do those things in hiding.\nMEMBER: Okay. So I've asked you a couple of questions now about things made you feel and you just keep telling me that you did it in secret or hiding but that's not telling me how you felt, I want to know how you felt personally, emotionally, how did you feel?\n(01:00:09)\nCLAIMANT: So when I see a man I'm attracted to him. (Inaudible) a long time ago, so because I started those things a long time ago so when I see a man I'm attracted to him.\nMEMBER: You told me that Tanzanian society discriminates against homosexuals, so how do you deal with society - or you told me that they're discriminatory, were you taught in Tanzania that being a homosexual is wrong?\nCLAIMANT: Being taught, could you please repeat?\nMEMBER: Yes. So you've told me how discriminatory society is against homosexuals in Tanzania, so were you taught that being a homosexual is wrong or bad?\nCLAIMANT: Yes.\nMEMBER: So when you began to notice that you were having homosexual feelings for men how did you feel given that you were taught that it was wrong?\nCLAIMANT: I felt bad but because I had already started and I was already used to it, I couldn't stop.10\n[23] I note that the Appellant's answers repeated variations of the phrase, \"when I see a man with buttocks I'm attracted to him.\" Despite clear open-ended questions from the RPD, the Appellant did not provide an answer to how he felt when he realized his attraction to men. With a final rephrased question, the Appellant testified that he felt bad about it. I agree with the RPD that the Appellant repeatedly failed to answer the question he was asked, and the answer he did provide was vague and lacked detail. I concur with the negative inference drawn by the RPD.\nThe Appellant's testimony about his partner\n[24] The RPD found that the Appellant's testimony about what he liked about his partner was vague and lacking in detail given that the relationship lasted for 11 years. The Appellant argues that he testified to the best of his knowledge and that the RPD should have noted that the SOGIE Guideline indicates that some individuals have difficulty talking about their sexual orientation with authorities. The Appellant further argues that the RPD should have guided the Appellant to provide the information that it sought. I disagree.\n[25] The RPD asked the Appellant about his partner:\nMEMBER: So tell me, what were some of the things that you liked about him?\nCLAIMANT: He was a man but he used to present himself as a female person, that's why I loved him.\nMEMBER: Okay. So what do you mean by that, what do you mean he presented himself as a female person?\nINTERPRETER: Actually he used the word he presented himself as a girl. (Inaudible).\nCLAIMANT: He loved me, he loved to have sex all the time.\nMEMBER: Okay. But my question was what do you mean by he presented himself as a girl, what did you mean by that?\nCLAIMANT: I mean his actions, his actions.\nMEMBER: Okay. So what do you mean by his actions, can you expand on that for me?\nCLAIMANT: Because he chose me he used to come and visit me, so he would come and we would make love and then - so that is how I became, like he was like my lover.\nMEMBER: Okay. So, sir, I'm just going to remind you once again, okay? Remember at the outset I told you to listen to the question that's being asked and answer it directly. Go ahead, Madam Interpreter.\nCLAIMANT: Okay.\nMEMBER: So again it just seems to have happened a couple of times now where I ask you a question and you don't seem to be answering the question that I'm asking, so just make sure that you listen carefully to what's being asked.\n(02:05:19)\nINTERPRETER: So he's asking to increase my voice. I'm actually on speaker on my phone, can everybody else hear me because I don't know what else to do, I'm on speaker already.\nMEMBER: I can hear you fine.\nINTERPRETER: Counsel?\nCOUNSEL: I can hear you correctly.\nINTERPRETER: Okay. Let me - Mr. Member, can you repeat what you said (inaudible) again, maybe he will hear what I said.\nMEMBER: So I was just reminding him to listen carefully to the question that's being asked and to answer that question directly.\nCLAIMANT: Okay.\nMEMBER: So was there - can you tell me anything else about [IJ], was there anything else that you liked about him?\nCLAIMANT: Yes.\nMEMBER: I'm asking him let's go one by one.\nCLAIMANT: So I loved [IJ] or [IJ] because of his appearance. And also the way he was close to me, that's how I loved him.\nMEMBER: Okay. Anything else?\nCLAIMANT: No.\nMEMBER: What about his appearance did you like?\nCLAIMANT: His shape and the way he presented himself, he was always very clean, very clean.11\n[26] In my view, the Appellant failed to answer the RPD's question several times and provided limited information about his partner of 11 years. He testified that what he liked about his partner was that he presented himself as a female and that his partner loved him and loved to have sex all the time. The Appellant stated that his partner presented himself as a female through his actions, which he explained meant that his partner loved him and used to come visit him, and they would have sex, and that is how his partner was his lover. The only additional details he provided were that he loved his partner's appearance, which was his shape, the way he presented himself and that he was very clean.\n[27] I note that the SOGIE Guideline does specifically indicate that persons with diverse SOGIE may have difficulty discussing their sexual orientation with authorities:\n3.3 Many individuals with diverse SOGIE conceal their SOGIE in their country of reference out of mistrust or fear of repercussion by state and non-state actors, or due to previous experiences of stigmatization and violence. These circumstances may manifest themselves as an individual being reluctant to discuss, or having difficulty discussing, their SOGIE with a decision-maker based on a fear or general mistrust of authority figures, particularly where intolerance or punishment of individuals with diverse SOGIE are sanctioned by state officials in an individual's country of reference.12\n[28] In article 6.1, decision-makers are also cautioned not to make the assumption that \"[r]omantic or sexual relationships share the same dynamics and characteristics across cultures\".13\n[29] In my view, the Appellant's vague and reluctant testimony about his 11-year partner is not reasonably explained by hesitancy in discussing his sexual orientation with the RPD. The Appellant clearly testified on several occasions that he and his partner liked to engage in sex frequently, which does not indicate hesitancy about his sexual orientation. Rather, the vague testimony was given in respect of the qualities that he liked about his partner. I also do not view the RPD's questions as assuming that the dynamics or characteristics of his partner are similar to North American culture; the question is simply asking the Appellant to describe what he liked about his 11-year partner. I find no error in the RPD's conclusion that the Appellant's testimony was vague and was not reasonably explained by hesitancy in discussing his sexual orientation. I concur in drawing a negative inference as to the Appellant's credibility on this basis.\nOmissions and inconsistencies are determinative\n[30] The RPD found numerous omissions and inconsistencies between the Appellant's testimony and his narrative and application forms as well as inconsistencies in his own testimony. The Appellant argues that the omissions are elaborative, and the inconsistencies are minor in nature or reasonably explained. I disagree.\nThe beginning of the Appellant's relationship with his same-sex partner\n[31] In his narrative, the Appellant indicated that his relationship with his same-sex partner began when they were in secondary school and, \"[w]e continued our relationship for about a year till the end of school.\"14 At the hearing, he testified that the relationship began after he finished secondary school. When the RPD noted that this was inconsistent with his narrative, the Appellant claimed that he had not testified that the relationship began at the end of secondary school and stated that the earlier testimony must have been an interpretation error:\nMEMBER: So after you finished your secondary education that's when you officially started, started what?\nCLAIMANT: I started having a sexual relationship with [IJ].\nMEMBER: Again I asked you this, but you didn't really answer the question. You told me that you met him in 2005 but you then went on to say that you knew him when you were kids. So I'm just, again I'm trying to understand why I'm getting seemingly two different answers from you. Just help me understand, sir, I'm not trying to confuse you or mislead you, I just need to understand what your claim is so that I can make a fair decision here, I don't want to misunderstand you.\nINTERPRETER: He asked me to explain to you, so I just told him that my role is not to explain but just to say the same of what he says (inaudible).\nCLAIMANT: So it's like this, I knew [IJ] since we were kids, we used to play together and we used to do those things, but officially we started being in a relationship in 2005.\nMEMBER: You said before that after you completed your secondary education is when you officially started a sexual relationship with him, that's what you just testified.\nCLAIMANT: Yes.\nMEMBER: But in your narrative you wrote that you and him continued your relationship for about and a half or sorry, for about a year until the end of school, so that says that you were dating or in a relationship before school ended, now you're telling me after school ended. So again can you tell me why two different answers.\n(01:45:24)\nCLAIMANT: That you said - you said there's a difference between the narrative, what is in the narrative and what he just said. So in the narrative the relationship ended a year after school, in the present information we (inaudible) is that he said (inaudible) after finished school, secondary school.\nMEMBER: Okay, so ---\nCLAIMANT: And you want to know why the difference in the two responses.\nINTERPRETER: So I just want to say that that's what he wanted me to repeat to him (inaudible).\nMEMBER: Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on, no. So what the narrative says is that the relationship was going on during school but what he told me in testimony is that it started after completing secondary education so why, I'm just wondering why there's the two conflicting pieces of information.\nINTERPRETER: Okay.\nCLAIMANT: So it is not after (inaudible).\nINTERPRETER: So Mr. XXXX says that he didn't say that he started a relationship after finishing secondary school, but the relationship started when he was in his last year (inaudible) school which was 2005.15\n[32] The RPD asked the interpreter to again recount the Appellant's testimony, and the interpreter confirmed that the Appellant initially testified that the relationship began at the end of secondary school. The RPD also asked Counsel about whether there were any issues with interpretation, and Counsel indicated that the Appellant knew enough English to notify the RPD if the translation was not accurate. The RPD rejected the Appellant's explanation that the interpretation was inaccurate as he had not raised any issue about interpretation until he was asked to explain the inconsistency.\n[33] The Appellant argues that the inconsistency is reasonably explained by an error in interpretation. The Appellant also argues that Counsel should have objected to the interpretation at the hearing. I do not find these arguments persuasive. The Appellant and Counsel did not raise any other interpretation issues at the December 4 or December 17, 2020 hearings nor did they do so prior to the RPD's decision. In this appeal, the Appellant has not submitted any evidence of incorrect interpretation, nor has he made a complaint about the interpreter or former counsel. As a result, I find that the RPD was correct in finding that the inconsistency was not reasonably explained. I concur in drawing a negative inference on this basis.\nThe date of birth of the Appellant's same-sex partner\n[34] Although the Appellant did not specifically make submissions regarding the RPD's finding that his testimony about his partner's date of birth was inconsistent, I have conducted an independent review of the RPD's conclusion and find no error. In addition, I find that this inconsistency is significant as part of the cumulative negative credibility findings with respect to the Appellant.\n[35] In testimony, the Appellant indicated that his same-sex partner's date of birth was in XXXX 1992. The RPD asked how the Appellant and his partner finished school together if his partner was four years younger than him, and he indicated that his partner started school earlier. When the Appellant stated that he was 17 years old when he finished secondary school, the RPD noted that that would mean his partner was 13 years old at the time. The Appellant then stated that he had made a mistake and testified that he was 19 years old when he finished secondary school. Despite the RPD pointing out that he could not have been 19 years old in 2005 given his date of birth, the Appellant insisted it was the truth:\nMEMBER: So you told me that he was born in 1992 which is four years younger than you and so if you completed school at the age of 17 then I mean the math would suggest that he was 13 when you completed school.\nCLAIMANT: So I made a mistake about something when I finished secondary school.\nINTERPRETER: I'm asking him to (inaudible).\nMEMBER: Yeah, so what was the mistake?\nCLAIMANT: I finished secondary school in 2005, so I was not 17. So I was not 17 at that time.\n(02:25:34)\nMEMBER: Okay. So can you tell me how old were you then in 2005?\nCLAIMANT: Nineteen.\nMEMBER: Sir, how could you have been 19 in 2005 if you were born in 1988?\nCLAIMANT: That was my age.\nMEMBER: So you were 19 in the year 2005?\nINTERPRETER: He's asking me to repeat.\nCLAIMANT: Yes.16\n[36] I note that the Appellant was born on XXXX XXXX, 1988, which means that, in XXXX 2005, the Appellant would have been 17 years of age, not 19 years of age. I agree with the RPD that the inconsistency is not reasonably explained. I concur in drawing a negative inference on this basis.\n[37] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant has not established that he was engaged in a same-sex relationship with IR in Tanzania.\nThe Appellant's arrest in 2015 and the end of his marriage\n[38] In his narrative, the Appellant indicated that his marriage ended in 2015 after his wife accused him of showing little sexual interest in her.17 He also describes being arrested XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in 2018.18 At the first hearing, the Appellant testified that he was arrested in 2015 for having same-sex relations.19 He also testified that he and his wife separated because she found out that he was in a same-sex relationship after he was apprehended and went to court in 2015.20 The RPD noted that his testimony was inconsistent with his narrative, and the Appellant testified that both reasons were true. When the Appellant was asked why he did not indicate in his narrative that he was arrested in 2015 and that this resulted in his marriage ending, the Appellant stated that he did not know.\n[39] The Appellant argues that he reasonably explained the omission by stating that both circumstances were the reason for his marriage ending. The Appellant also argues that the omission is not material and that he was not advised to include the kind of detail that the RPD demanded in his narrative.\n[40] In my view, the Appellant did omit from his narrative that his wife found out that he was in a same-sex relationship because he was arrested in 2015 and that their relationship ended following his arrest. I accept that the Appellant also indicated in his narrative and gave testimony that his wife accused him of showing no sexual interest in her, which is also a reason why his marriage ended. The fact that both circumstances contributed to the end of the marriage does not explain the omission of the Appellant's arrest and its impact on his marriage. I also do not agree with the Appellant that the omission is minor in nature. The Appellant's arrests or interactions with the police about his sexual orientation are material allegations in his claim. It is reasonable to expect that the Appellant would include his first arrest for same-sex relations and the fact that his wife discovered his sexual orientation in light of the arrest. I find that the RPD did not err. I concur in drawing a negative inference as to the Appellant's credibility.\nThe number and reason for the Appellant's arrests\n[41] The RPD found numerous omissions and inconsistencies in the Appellant's evidence regarding the number of arrests and the reasons for the arrests. The Appellant has not made specific arguments that these findings are in error other than submitting, generally, that the alleged omissions are elaborative details, and the inconsistencies are minor and reasonably explained. Having conducted my independent review, I find these additional inconsistencies and omissions, along with my above-noted findings, are cumulatively determinative. Given the significance of these findings, I have set out my review in some detail.\n(i) Documents related to the Appellant's arrests\n[42] In his narrative, the Appellant states that he and his partner were attacked by community soldiers who beat them and took their phones and money in 2017. He also states that he was part of a group of men who were arrested and detained by police on XXXX XXXX, 2019.21\n[43] In his Schedule \"A\" form, the Appellant indicated that he had never been convicted and was not currently charged with a criminal offence nor was he the subject of any criminal proceedings in any other country. He further indicated that he had been detained on XXXX XXXX XXXX in 2019 for being in a same-sex relationship.22 In his Schedule 12 form, he indicated that he was arrested on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, 2019 for same-sex allegations and has never been charged or convicted of any crime in any country.23\n[44] When the Appellant arrived in Canada, he was interviewed by a Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) officer, and he provided different information about his arrests. The officer's notes indicate that \"he was charged in 2015 for being in a relationship with a man. He spent two days in jail until his father bailed him out. The case is still on-going which is why he fled to Canada.\"24\n[45] The Appellant submitted a subpoena and a police order as part of his claim. The subpoena is dated XXXX XXXX, 2015 and indicates that the Appellant was charged for the offence of supporting homosexuals.25 The police order is dated XXXX XXXX, 2019 and indicates that the Appellant is required to report to the police station on XXXX XXXX, 2019.26\n(ii) The Appellant's testimony about his arrests\n[46] The Appellant's hearing occurred on two separate days: December 4 (the first hearing) and December 17, 2020 (the second hearing). At the first hearing, the Appellant testified that he was arrested in 2015, 2017 and 2018. When the RPD asked him why he did not mention the 2015 arrest in his narrative, the Appellant said he did not know. When the RPD noted that there was no mention of his 2015 arrest in his Schedule 12 form, the Appellant said that the 2015 incident was not very serious in comparison to the 2019 incident that included many people, and they were beaten and taken by police. He stated that that was why he did not include the 2015 arrest in the forms. The Appellant was then asked what he was arrested for in 2015:\nMEMBER: Okay. So, sir, when I ask you a question and then you don't answer that question, okay, that goes to your credibility and I told you at the outset that I have to assess your credibility in this claim, okay? And so again I'm asking a very simple question, why were you arrested in 2015?\nCLAIMANT: Like (inaudible) it was a group of us together who were attacked by the police and they arrested some of us. Another time I was arrested three or four times. And another time I was arrested because of the same reason of the same sex relationship.\nMEMBER: Okay. Sir, you told me that you didn't put down the arrest in 2015 because it was just you who was arrested and now you're telling me that it was a group of you who were arrested. Can you just - your story keeps changing, sir, please help me understand what you mean.\nCLAIMANT: So when I said alone, I meant I didn't involve [IJ] because were my other friends, the friends that I used to meet (inaudible) together.27\n[47] When the hearing resumed on December 17, 2020, the Appellant again gave inconsistent testimony that evolved when the inconsistencies were pointed out to him by the RPD. The Appellant clarified that he was arrested four times: the first three arrests were in 2015, and the last arrest was in 2019. He testified that the first three arrests were related to being a motorist, and the last arrest was the only arrest related to his sexual orientation.28 When the RPD noted that the subpoena indicated that he was charged with \"supporting homosexuals\" in XXXX2015, the Appellant agreed and stated that he received the subpoena in XXXX2015 and that it was for \"gayism\":\nMEMBER: Okay, so were you - so the subpoena says that you are charged with supporting homosexuals. So were you charged with anything?\nCLAIMANT: So first I had a lover and we were both arrested by the police. Then I was charged of being a homosexual. I was (inaudible) to the court and that's when my parents came to get me released.\nMEMBER: Sir, I asked you a few minutes ago what you were charged with or what you were arrested for in 2015 and you said that they were all normal offences like driving offences and that they weren't to do with your sexual orientation. But now you're telling me that in - sorry, go ahead.\n(00:26:13)\nOkay, and so hold on, so now you're telling me that you and your partner were arrested, you know you were charged because you're a homosexual. So again, can you just tell me why your testimony is changing?\nCLAIMANT: Sir, I remember in the first hearing you asked me what I was arrested for in 2015. I explained I was arrested for being or supporting homosexuality and I explained that (inaudible) my wife learning of that she left me; she walked away from my family.\nMEMBER: But I asked you today.\nCLAIMANT: Okay.\nMEMBER: I asked you today what you were arrested for in 2015. I asked you a lot of questions about your arrest and you said the only time you were arrested because of your sexual orientation was in 2019; the other ones had to do with driving or traffic offences.\nCLAIMANT: Sir, I thought that the 2015 arrests I had finished answering that question in the first hearing so hence I got confused today by answering the same question because I thought we had finished dealing with it.29\n[48] It is clear to me that the Appellant provided testimony that is inconsistent with his narrative and claim forms, the notes from the CBSA officer, the subpoena and the police order. It is also evident that the Appellant's testimony evolved as these inconsistencies were pointed out and resulted in the Appellant providing further internally inconsistent testimony. In my view, the Appellant did not provide reasonable explanations for these omissions and inconsistencies. I also agree with the RPD's conclusion that these inconsistencies and omissions are material as his interactions with the police in relation to his sexual orientation are a key part of the Appellant's claim. The RPD did not err in drawing negative inferences as to the Appellant's credibility on that basis.\n[49] Finally, I note that the RPD placed no weight on the subpoena and the police order due to irregularities in the documents. The Appellant has not argued that the RPD erred in this conclusion. I have conducted an independent review and find no error in the RPD's conclusion. I concur with the RPD in giving no weight to the documents.\n[50] Given the multiple negative inferences drawn and the irregularities in the police documents, I find that the Appellant has not credibly established, on a balance of probabilities, that he was arrested in 2019.\nCorroborative evidence\n[51] I disagree with the Appellant's argument that the RPD had no basis to expect corroborative documentation about his partner's arrest. As noted above, numerous negative inferences about the Appellant's credibility were drawn based on omissions, and vague and inconsistent testimony. The cumulative effect of these inferences is that the presumption of truthfulness has been rebutted. The RPD did not err in requiring corroborative documentation about the arrest of the Appellant's partner.\nCONCLUSION\n[52] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nKaren McGovern\nKaren McGovern\nNovember 4, 2021\nDate\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD File \/ Dossier de la SAR : TC1-00493\nRAD.25.02 (August 20, 2021)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n2\nImmigration and Refugee\nBoard of Canada\nRefugee Appeal Division\nCommission de l'immigration et du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 du Canada\nSection d'appel des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s\nRAD.25.02 (August 20, 2021)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nI. INTRODUCTION\n[1] XXXX XXXX, a citizen of Albania, appeals a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rendered on November 17, 2017, denying his claim for refugee protection.\n[2] The Appellant does not request to submit new evidence in support of his appeal and does not request a hearing before the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD).\n[3] The Appellant fears returning to Albania where he says he faces a risk to his life because of a vendetta between families. He submits that the RPD erred in rejecting his claim on the basis that he failed to rebut the presumption that adequate state protection is available to him in Albania.\n[4] The Appellant requests that the RAD set aside the determination of the RPD and find that he is a \"Convention Refugee\" according to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) or a \"person in need of protection\" according to section 97. In the alternative, the Appellant requests that the decision of the RPD be set aside and that this matter be returned to the RPD for redetermination by a differently constituted panel.\nII. DETERMINATION\n[5] Pursuant to s. 111(1)(a) of the IRPA, I confirm the decision of the RPD, finding that the Appellant is not a Convention Refugee nor a person in need of protection. The appeal is dismissed.\nIII. BACKGROUND AND OVERVIEW OF APPEAL\n[6] On XXXX XXXX, 2014, the Appellant's cousins were involved in a violent altercation with members of the XXXX XXXX family. The incident, which took place in Kukes, Northern Albania, left one individual dead and two seriously wounded. The Appellant's father was initially a suspect in the murder, but all charges were dropped. The Appellant's cousin was convicted of the crime for which he is currently serving an XXXX year prison sentence.\n[7] Following the incident, the family of XXXX XXXX refused all attempts at reconciliation with members of the Appellant's family. Instead, the XXXX family chose to pursue a vendetta according to Kanun law.\n[8] At the time of the incident, the Appellant was a teenager living with his immediate family in the capital city of Tirana, located approximately 4 hours away from Kukes. In order to ensure the safety of his family, the Appellant's father hired a private security firm and installed security cameras on his property. While the Appellant's father asked the police for assistance, they responded that they could do nothing until someone committed a crime.\n[9] The Appellant and his father remained self-contained in their home.\n[10] When the Appellant's father learned that the XXXX family had paid someone to follow their family and kill them, they made arrangements for the Appellant to leave the country.\n[11] While the Appellant obtained a visa to the USA in 2015, his parents were reluctant for him to leave home given his young age. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, the Appellant left Albania and made his way to New York. On April 25, 2017, he traveled to Canada. He made his refugee claim on May 3, 2017 when he was 17 years old.\n[12] On November 17, 2017, the RPD rejected the claim on the basis that the Appellant did not rebut the presumption of adequate state protection.\nIV. DETERMINATIVE ISSUE\n[13] The following issues are raised on appeal:\n1. Did the RPD exhibit bias in its assessment of state protection?\n2. Is the RPD decision unintelligible?\n3. Did the RPD err in finding that the Appellant failed to provide clear and convincing evidence that adequate state protection is unavailable to him?\nVI. SCOPE OF THE RAD APPEAL\n[14] The RAD reviews decisions on a standard of correctness after conducting an independent assessment of the evidence before it.1 Deference may be required when the RPD enjoys a meaningful advantage in the assessment of the credibility of oral evidence.2 Unless specifically stated below, I have applied the correctness standard in the present case.\nVII. ANALYSIS\n1. Did the RPD exhibit bias in its assessment of state protection?\n[15] On appeal, it is submitted that the RPD exhibited bias in reaching the decision to reject the claim. More specifically, it is argued that the panel member chose to only give probative weight to documentary evidence which supported the RPD's conclusion to reject the claim instead of proceeding with an analysis of the evidence as a whole.3\n[16] An allegation of bias is a serious allegation which must meet a very high threshold. As noted by the Federal Court in Zhu,\n\"An allegation of bias, especially actual and not simply apprehended bias, against a tribunal is a serious allegation. It challenges the integrity of the tribunal and of its members who participated in the impugned decision. It cannot be done lightly. It cannot rest on mere suspicion, pure conjecture, insinuations or mere impressions of an applicant or his counsel. It must be supported by material evidence demonstrating conduct that derogates from the standard.\"4 [Emphasis added]\n[17] The onus is on the Appellant to demonstrate actual bias. I find that he has failed to meet that onus in the present case.\n[18] The crux of the claim centers on the adequacy of state protection in Albania in the context of a vendetta between families. In reaching the conclusion that the Appellant did not provide clear and convincing evidence that state protection is unavailable to him, the RPD provided a summary of the available documentary evidence found in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Albania. To be clear, in paragraphs 10 through 18 of the decision, the RPD canvassed information from different sources and acknowledged that there is mixed evidence regarding the adequacy of state protection in Albania.\n[19] For example, the RPD noted that a report from the UK Home Office found that there are instances of corruption and abuse which arise periodically in the police system and that the government has developed mechanisms to investigate and punish police abuse and corruption.5 The same UK report noted that despite the existence of an independent judicial system, corruption, political pressure and interference is widespread.6\n[20] The RPD also noted that while in the past, courts in the UK have found that state protection in Albania has been insufficient where Kanun law predominates, more recent information indicates that Kanun law no longer predominates in Northern Albania where active policing and prosecution services now exist.7\n[21] While the UK Home Office notes that the Albanian government has taken steps to improve state protection for victims of blood feuds8, the RPD also acknowledged that other sources such as the Ombudsman of Albania, an NGO report and a report from the Swedish Migration Services point to inefficiency of the state apparatus for families involved in blood feuds.9\n[22] At paragraph 18 of the decision, the RPD summarized the documentary evidence as follows:\n\"In summary, the authorities in Albania have made significant efforts to combat honour-based crimes in the country. However, some sources indicate that the government has not sufficiently implemented the measures it has adopted. As a matter of course, the Tribunal considered the claimant's particular circumstances to determine the adequacy of state protection.\"\n[23] After setting out the differing views about the adequacy of state protection in Albania, the RPD, as it is required to do10, went on to conduct a balanced, contextualized assessment of the objective evidence regarding the adequacy of state protection in light of the particular circumstances of the Appellant's case.11 After applying the objective evidence to the facts of the case, the RPD determined that the Appellant did not rebut the presumption of state protection.12\n[24] This manner of proceeding does not derogate from the required standard of conduct applicable to a panel member called upon to proceed with a contextual analysis of state protection. As such, I find there is no evidence of bias in the present case.\n2. Is the RPD decision unintelligible?\n[25] Counsel argues that the decision rendered by the RPD is incoherent and unintelligible.13 To support this submission, Counsel makes the following assertions:\n- The RPD misapprehended the documentary evidence regarding state protection in the context of vendettas and did not consider all of the available documentary evidence;14\n- The RPD minimized the gravity of the situation in Albania regarding vendettas and therefore minimized the personal risk faced by the Appellant if he returns to Albania;15\n- The RPD based its decision to reject the claim on facts that are neither relevant or determinative of the claim;16\n- The RPD was unable to clearly distinguish the relevant, probative elements of the claim.17\n[26] With respect, this submission has no merit. While Counsel asserts that the RPD committed a series of fundamental errors resulting in a decision which is both incoherent and unintelligible, Counsel has failed to indicate how or where the RPD may have made such errors in the present case. Rather, Counsel limits the submissions to bald assertions without directing the RAD to any specific evidence to support the allegations. It follows that this ground of appeal is unfounded.\n3. Did the RPD err in finding that the Appellant failed to provide clear and convincing evidence that adequate state protection is unavailable to him?\n[27] In the present case, the RPD canvassed the documentary evidence regarding state protection including the state structure of Albania, the government's response to honour crimes and the results of those efforts. The RPD reached the conclusion that while the system is not perfect, there has been legislative reform and steps have been taken to respond to the phenomena.\n[28] On appeal, Counsel concedes that the documentary evidence points to legislative reform in Albania and concrete steps have been taken to ensure justice is rendered to perpetrators of such crimes. This being said, it is submitted that the RPD erred by failing to consider that some sources consulted in the objective evidence find that state protection is inadequate when it comes to preventing such crimes or protecting civilians at risk of a vendetta, such as in the present case.18\n[29] After considering the entirety of the evidence which includes a review of the available objective evidence regarding state protection19, I find that the Appellant failed to rebut the presumption of adequate state protection based on the particular circumstances of his case. In order to explain this finding, I begin by setting out a statement of the law with respect to state protection. Next, I provide a summary of the available documentary evidence regarding state protection in Albania, including efforts to prevent and protect those at risk of vendettas or blood feud related crimes. Finally, adopting a contextual approach, I apply the objective evidence to the facts of the present case.\nStatement of the law concerning state protection\n[30] A state is presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens, except when there is evidence that the state is in a complete situation of breakdown. In Ward, the Supreme Court explains that while this presumption increases the burden on the claimant, it \"reinforces the underlying rationale of international protection as a surrogate, coming into play where no alternative remains to the claimant.\"20\n[31] To rebut this presumption, a claimant must \"adduce relevant, reliable and convincing evidence which satisfies the trier of fact on a balance of probabilities that state protection is inadequate.\"21\nObjective evidence\n[32] Albania, with the assistance of international monitoring and supervision, has adopted legislation and implemented measures to strengthen weak state institutions, stabilize its political infrastructure and implement reforms. Focused on becoming a country which meets European Union (EU) standards, the Albanian parliament unanimously adopted a set of constitutional amendments in 2016 aimed at reforming the justice system. The amendments address corruption in the judiciary and strengthen its independence from organized crime which includes a reorganization of the justice system, as well as the process for vetting judges and prosecutors.22\n[33] According to a Response to Information Request (RIR) prepared by the IRB, the Albanian police is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Interior. The police are organized centrally and locally. There is a General Directorate of the Albanian State police which is located in Tirana. There are also 12 Regional Police Directorates, each composed of 3 to 6 Commissariats. The Regional Police Directorates carry out the directions of the General Director, coordinate training and personnel matters and supervise the Commissariats and police stations within their region. There are at least 8 police stations in Tirana.23\n[34] The UK July 2017 Country Policy and Information Note on Albania states that there is a fully functioning police and judicial system. Civilian authorities generally maintain effective control over the police but there are instances of corruption and instances of police abuse. The government has internal mechanisms to investigate and punish police abuse and corruption and are reported to carry out investigations and issue sanctions. Moreover, Albania has an independent ombudsman office which processes complaints, including complaints against police officers. While there is an established independent judicial system, it is affected by politicization, intimidation, limited accountability, insufficient resources, lengthy proceedings and backlogs.24\n[35] In 2017, the United States Department of State provided the following update on the police in Albania:\n\"Civilian authorities generally maintained effective control over police, the Guard of the Republic, the armed forces, and the SIS, although officials periodically used state resources for personal gain and members of the security forces committed abuses.\nPolice did not always enforce the law equitably. Personal associations, political or criminal connections, poor infrastructure, lack of equipment, or inadequate supervision often influenced law enforcement. Poor leadership and a lack of diversity in the workforce contributed to continued corruption and unprofessional behavior. Authorities continued to make efforts to address these problems by renovating police facilities, upgrading vehicles, and publicly highlighting anticorruption measures.\nImpunity remained a serious problem, although the government made greater efforts to address it, in particular by increasing the use of camera evidence to document and prosecute police misconduct.\nWhile the government had mechanisms to investigate and punish abuse and corruption, police corruption remained a problem. The Service for Internal Affairs and Complaints received 3,811 telephone complaints via the anticorruption \"green line\" through July 31. The majority of the complaints involved \"inaction of police officers,\" \"unjust fine\/ticket,\" or \"violation of standard operating procedures.\" The office filed 43 administrative violations, recommending 57 police officers for disciplinary proceedings. The cases of five officers were forwarded to the Prosecution Office. During the year the ombudsman also processed complaints against police officers, mainly concerning problems with arrests and detention.25\n[36] A report from the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) also cites sources indicating that law enforcement continues to improve and the police have a visible presence in large cities, however their response time is often poor due to limited resources. The report notes that \"[c]itizens may submit complaints about the police to the Internal Control Service, which operates under the authority of the Ministry of the Interior or to the Professional Standards Department, an office within the Albanian police. There is also an anti-corruption web portal where citizens can report misconduct, including misconduct by the police.26 While corruption remains an endemic problem in Albania, complaints filed have intensified and are routinely investigated.27\n[37] Turning to the situation of state protection in the context of honour based crimes like vendettas\/blood feuds in Albania, the IRB issued an RIR in September 2015 which examined this issue.28\n[38] According to sources consulted in the RIR, the Albanian Criminal Code was amended to include harsher penalties for individuals who commit murder related to a blood feud. The amendments also include penalties for \"serious intimidation for revenge or blood feud against a person in order to have him immobilized within the house\" and inciting other persons for revenge or blood feud. The jurisdiction over such cases was transferred to Albania's Serious Crime Courts.29\n[39] As noted by Counsel, the 2015 RIR also mentions that the commonly held view that the Albanian police are able to manage blood feuds was not shared by the Ombudsman of Albania, the NGO Operation Dove or the 2013 Swedish Migration Agency Report which found serious deficiencies with regard to the capacity and prevalence of corruption in the police. The Albanian judiciary is also criticized for imposing lighter sentences on perpetrators of blood feud related homicides.30\n[40] This being said, the RIR further mentions that according to the UN Special Rapporteur in June 2012, the Albanian State Police launched a countrywide database which lists all identified individuals involved in a blood feud. This list includes cases submitted to court and those not followed up through official channels. According to the British Embassy, the authorities prosecute perpetrators of blood-feud related crimes. The Albanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs states that all feud motivated crimes are detected and perpetrators are punished by the courts.31\n[41] With respect to the state's ability to prevent or protect affected families, the RIR notes that according to the British Embassy in Tirana, police and criminal justice system representatives provide a degree of protection to affected families. This being said, the RIR further mentions that \"Country Reports 2014 quotes the ombudsman of Albania as stating that the authorities' efforts to protect families or prevent blood feud killings were insufficient. Operation Dove similarly reports that very often, families involved in blood feuds complain about ...the widespread corruption, and the workflow of justice processes, explaining that there remains a lack of certainty of sentencing for those who committed crimes because of blood feud, a lack of...appropriate police intervention, and an inefficiency of a state apparatus guaranteeing the safety of citizens who risk their lives because of reasons linked to blood feuds.\"32\n[42] The 2016 EASO report also reviewed the situation regarding blood feuds in Albania, noting that there are still occasional cases, mainly in the rural northern areas of Albania, but that the practice has decreased steadily. Following a report from the Ombudsman, Parliament adopted a resolution and recommendations to end blood feuds.33 It is noted that successive Albanian governments have taken measures to eliminate blood feuds and revenge killings. The Criminal Code was amended in 2013 and 2014 and includes lifetime penalties for blood-feud murders.34\n[43] A 2016 Report from the Swiss Refugee Council notes that the situation regarding blood feuds remains a problem in Albania.35 The report states that corruption remains a major issue in the judiciary and police, partly attributed to low salaries, bribes and the importance of clans in society.36 The report notes that the Albanian Government has intensified its efforts to combat crimes based on vendettas by imposing strict sentences up to 30 years. However, there are few crimes that are prosecuted, which demonstrates that the authorities, including the police, prosecutors and courts, are ineffective.37 The police and judiciary remain passive in order to avoid exposing themselves to danger or becoming implicated in a vendetta. The Swiss Report cites sources indicating that government officials, politicians and affluent individuals were able to avoid prosecution in several cases.38\n[44] The 2016 UK Country Information and Guidance Report regarding blood feuds39 notes that Albania has taken steps to improve state protection, including better policing, specific criminalisation of blood feuds and blood feud killings, the creation of specialised police units and the establishment of a high-level coordination committee.40 The report further notes that in areas where Kanun law predominates, particularly in northern Albania, those steps did not yet provide sufficiency of protection from Kanun-related-blood-taking if an active feud exists. However, more recent information from the British Embassy in Tirana is to the effect that Kanun law no longer predominates. Most notably, a field visit found that the region of Shkoder established an active policing and prosecution service. The current government (since 2013) has also made efforts to tackle blood feuds by issuing revised instructions to local police and toughening sentences to offenders through amendments to the Albanian Criminal Code. There is active monitoring of the affected families and there is active policing and prosecution of crimes.41\n[45] The United States Department 2017 Country Report on Human Rights Practices in Albania mentions that alleged incidents of societal killings including both blood-feud and revenge killings, occurred during the year, but as of August, authorities had reported only one case of a blood-feud killing. The ombudsman reported that authorities' efforts to protect families or prevent blood-feud deaths were insufficient, although the government increased efforts to prosecute such crimes.42\n[46] In 2017, the Belgium Commissioner General for Refugees and Stateless Persons43 conducted a fact-finding mission, gathering information about blood feuds in present-day Albania and the state response in terms of protection and prevention. The report notes that \"interventions by the authorities (police and Prosecutor's Office) have become another possible characteristic of contemporary blood feuds. All the consulted experts agreed that the police forces nowadays try to intervene in blood feud situations and that police interventions can be of various kinds (identification, monitoring, prevention, arrest, etc.)\" Even though there are various ways to file a complaint (in the office, by telephone, by e-mail or through a mobile phone application), many experts confirmed that people do not easily go to the police or to the prosecutor to denounce or to report a contemporary blood feud.\n[47] The report notes that the Vice-Minister of Internal Affairs declared that the authorities are closely monitoring the known cases of contemporary blood feuds and that the phenomenon is largely under control. This statement was repeated in more detail by two sources at the Albanian police force who were met during the fact-finding mission. The General Director from the Albanian State police claimed that the police have made a lot of efforts to end the blood feud phenomenon since the National Action Plan. With respect to the prevention, tracking and fighting criminal acts of murder motivated by blood feuds, he mentioned that currently, each officer knows what to do and that good cooperation has been established between the police and several other organizations which facilitates quick intervention and arrest.\n[48] According to police sources, as soon as there are serious indications of an imminent crime (including threats) or that a crime was committed, these elements are transferred to the Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prevention. Moreover, in order to prevent new blood feuds, the damaged families are immediately monitored proactively in order to prevent that a blood feud will develop or prevent a revenge killing. The representative of the Shkod\u00ebr Regional Police Directorate indicated that negligence by police officers in matters related to blood feuds are now severely punished.44\n[49] Both police sources argued that the implementation of directives launched by the government to halt the blood feud phenomenon has had a positive impact and has resulted in a decrease in the phenomenon. The 2017 Belgium report mentions that new cases of blood feud murders are very rare and that many non-governmental interlocutors referred to the police statistics as a reliable source.45\n[50] Most notably, a local representative of the National Ombudsman who was consulted in March 2017 noted that while in the past, blood feud cases were not investigated at all, \"the presence of the law has very much advanced nowadays. ...Closed cases have been re-opened and potential blood feud cases are treated with particular attention, even in the remote areas. If something happens, the police will intervene nowadays. ...The police will start a process of investigation and arrest those who pose a threat.\"46 Other sources contacted echoed that the police will intervene to assist the affected families threatened by a blood feud.47\n[51] As noted above, the Prosecutor's office also plays an active role in combatting blood feuds. They conducted round tables in every county to investigate the number of people who are confined as a result of blood feuds. In 2013 and 2014, officers of the prosecutor went to every house which claimed a link to a blood feud to obtain enough evidence to start a case. The identified blood feuds are monitored by the authorities with the assistance of the police. The prosecutor's office collect information to assess whether a new crime case can be identified as a contemporary blood feud case. In 2015-2016, the Prosecutor's office increased cooperation with other institutions and re-opened old cases that had been closed because of a lack of evidence.48\n[52] Multiple sources consulted by the Belgium fact finding mission state that the judiciary continues to be seen as the weak point, susceptible to corruption with respect to charges and sentencing for blood feud related killings. There is the perception that bribing a judge may result in a lower sentence or bribing a prosecutor may result in a reduced charge.49 This being said, one professor notes that poor citizens are not able to bribe a judge. Only those who have strong ties with politics are able to influence court decisions.50\n[53] Another obstacle identified by the Prosecutor's Office is that many blood feud affected families do not want to collaborate with the judiciary and believe that only self-isolation can protect them. The state cannot take measures if they do not denounce. The state can only take action when a crime has happened. There is a tendency for the families to want to avoid the authorities and deal with the issue themselves.51\n[54] In sum, my review of the objective evidence reveals that since 2016, Albania has been involved in an ongoing process aimed at strengthening state protection. This process has included legislative reform and the implementation of various operational measures. The police and prosecutors office have jurisdiction to assist affected families of revenge and blood feud related issues. This role includes preventing and assisting families threatened with acts of revenge. While many sources acknowledge that Albania has made efforts to improve state protection for blood feud related cases, ongoing concerns are expressed about widespread corruption in the police and judiciary.\nContextual analysis of state protection in the present case\n[55] Mindful of the objective evidence, I turn now to consider state protection in the specific context of the Appellant's circumstances.52\nNature of the human rights violation\n[56] While living in Tirana, Albania, the Appellant was a minor who lived in self-confinement after his family became embroiled in a vendetta between families in 2014. The Appellant is now a young adult who lives with the threat of being targeted in a vendetta if he returns to Albania. This is a serious violation of his basic human rights.\nProfile of the agent of harm\n[57] The agent of harm is identified as the XXXX family from Kukes in Northern Albania. They are threatening to target the Appellant's immediate family in a vendetta. There is no evidence before me that this family has connections to state officials including the police, politicians or the judiciary. Likewise, there is no evidence that this family wields particular influence or power to the extent that they could benefit from corruption with the police or judiciary.\nEfforts of the Appellant to obtain state protection\n[58] The Appellant's evidence is that his father approached the Albanian police on one occasion to request assistance on the basis that his family is threatened with a vendetta by the XXXX family. While the Appellant testified that it is his understanding that his father approached the \"highest authority\" for assistance, he was unable to provide any other details. The Appellant testified that the police did not provide assistance to his family because a crime had not yet been committed. There is no evidence that the Appellant's family took any further steps to obtain assistance form the state.\n[59] The Appellant's father hired a private security company to protect his family and opted to send the Appellant to Canada to ensure his safety.\n[60] Did the RPD err in finding that the failure of the Appellant to pursue further avenues of protection in Albania was fatal to his claim?\n[61] The objective evidence canvassed in this decision points to the fact that the Albanian Criminal Code was amended to include harsher penalties for individuals who commit murder or threaten or incite persons in the context of revenge. This means that there are laws to punish people like the XXXX family who threaten revenge.\n[62] Next, I have considered Albania's capacity and will to effectively implement the existing laws which punish blood feud related murders and provide protection to affected families against threats and incitement of revenge.\n[63] There is no question that the Appellant's father, who approached the police on one occasion, received a poor response to his request for assistance regarding a threat of revenge. However, there exists other avenues of protection available to the Appellant. The General Directorate is situated in the Appellant's home town of Tirana. Moreover, Albania has 12 Regional Police Directorates, each with 3 to 6 Commissariats. There are at least 8 local police stations in Tirana.53 There is a Prosecution Office which also plays an active role in blood feud related crimes including intervening to prevent such crimes and assist families who are threatened. I find that the Appellant did not provide clear and convincing evidence to explain why his father, who is trained in law, did not pursue other available avenues of state protection on behalf of his son.\n[64] Next, I have considered that the most recent objective evidence found in the NDP for Albania continues to identify the existence of widespread corruption in the police and judiciary. However, there is no evidence that members of the XXXX family could benefit from such corruption in the present case. To be clear, the Appellant has not provided any evidence to suggest that the XXXX family has connections to government officials including the police, politicians or the judiciary. Likewise, there is also no evidence that the XXXX family wields influence or power to benefit from corruption.\n[65] Most significantly, the Appellant also provided cogent evidence that his cousin was held to account and is currently serving an XXXX year sentence for crimes committed against the XXXX family. While the police initially suspected that the Appellant's father was involved in the crime, charges were dropped. Simply put, while corruption is widespread in the police and judiciary, there is every indication that the state showed its capacity to investigate the crime, implement the law and punish the accused in the murder case involving a member of the XXXX family.\n[66] Finally, I wish to emphasize that the Appellant fears revenge stemming from a murder perpetrated by his cousin in Northern Albania in 2014. Mindful of the fact that state protection is a forward looking analysis, I have considered the most recent objective evidence regarding the response of the state in the context of blood feud related cases. I find that the 2017 Belgium Report is a comprehensive and persuasive report which addresses the state's ability to prevent and assist families threatened with revenge in Albania. Multiple sources cited in the 2017 Belgium Report (including the representative of the National Ombudsman who was contacted in March 2017) state that nowadays, police will intervene to assist the affected families threatened by a blood feud related crime. Moreover, the Prosecution Office is also transferred cases of affected families who face an imminent crime or threat as a result of revenge.54\n[67] In sum, having considered the nature of the harm feared, the profile of the agent of harm, the particular circumstances of the Appellant and the available documentary evidence regarding the adequacy of state protection in the context of blood-feud related crimes in Albania, I find that the RPD did not err in finding that the Appellant failed to pursue further avenues of protection open to him. In the final analysis, the Appellant failed to provide clear and convincing evidence to rebut the presumption that adequate state protection is available to him in Albania.\nVII. REMEDY\n[68] For all these reasons, I confirm the decision of the RPD in accordance with ss. 111(1)(a) of the IRPA, namely that XXXX XXXX is neither a \"Convention refugee\" nor a \"person in need of protection\".\n[69] The appeal is dismissed.\nPatricia O'Connor\nPatricia O'Connor\nSeptember 4, 2018\nDate\nPO\/dd\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n2\nRAD.25.02 (2014.09.11)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\nRAD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SAR : MB7-25651\n20\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] XXXX XXXX is a citizen of China. He appeals a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejecting his claim for refugee protection. On appeal, Mr. XXXX has not filed new evidence and does not request an oral hearing.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] The Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) dismisses the appeal and confirms the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection, pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\nAPPEAL SUMMARY\nBackground\n[3] The Appellant's claim for refugee protection was based on his Christian faith. He claims that his underground church in China was raided in XXXX, 2014, and he went into hiding. He hired a smuggler and came to Canada in XXXX, 2015. He did not initiate a refugee claim, however, until the end of November, 2015.\n[4] Full details of the Appellant's claim are set out in his Basis of Claim form and in the RPD's Record.\nRefugee Protection Division's Decision\n[5] The RPD rejected the Appellant's claim on the basis of two overarching credibility findings. First, the RPD found that the Appellant's testimony was vague, evasive and belied the level of personal engagement with Christianity that the Appellant asserted. Second, the RPD found that the Appellant had not provided a satisfactory explanation for the delay in initiating his refugee claim in Canada. This delay, therefore, was inconsistent with the Appellant's alleged fear of persecution in China. In addition to these main findings, the RPD also drew a negative inference from the Appellant's failure to provide updated information regarding his church participation in Canada and his failure to arrange for one of his Canadian pastors to appear at the hearing as a witness.\nISSUES ON APPEAL\n[6] The Appellant argues that the RPD committed a number of errors in assessing his Christian identity. I will identify these arguments in my analysis.\nROLE OF THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION\n[7] The Appellant has a statutory right of appeal to the RAD from a decision of the RPD on questions of law, fact or mixed law and fact.1 Generally, the RAD is to review the decisions that come before it on the correctness standard.2 In defining this standard, the Federal Court of Appeal in Huruglica held that the legislative purpose of the RAD is to serve as a \"safety net\" that would catch all mistakes made by the RPD.3 This requires the RAD to carry out its own independent analysis of the RPD's Record to determine whether, as submitted by the Appellant, the RPD erred.4 The RAD, as a true specialized appeal tribunal, must come to its own conclusions based on a fresh review of the evidence.5 Furthermore, the role of the RAD is distinct from and must not duplicate the role of the courts sitting on judicial review of refugee determination decisions.6\nANALYSIS\nDelay and subjective fear\n[8] Notably absent from the Appellant's memorandum are substantive arguments with respect to the RPD's findings on subjective fear and delay. In a concluding section titled \"Other Issues\", the Appellant mentions the RPD's findings with respect to delay, but he makes no argument as to how, or whether, the RPD erred.\n[9] Appeals before the RAD are an appellant-driven process. Paragraph 3(3)(g) of the RAD Rules stipulates that appellants are to set out in their memorandum the errors that form the grounds for the appeal.7 Nevertheless, in the absence of such argument, I have engaged in my own analysis of the Record, the Appellant's testimony and the RPD's reasons. Having done so, I have concluded that the RPD did not err in drawing an adverse inference from the Appellant's failure to initiate his claim for protection sooner.\n[10] The Appellant was explicit in his narrative that he fled China with the assistance of a smuggler because he feared persecution from the Public Security Bureau (PSB). While he entered Canada on a student visa, the Appellant also acknowledged that he never attended a school upon his arrival - this was not, after all, the purpose behind his travel to Canada. In response to questions about his delay, the Appellant further explained that he had no one to assist him, that he had insomnia, that he missed his family and did not communicate much with other people.\n[11] I find that the RPD did not err in rejecting these explanations. Once again, the Appellant claims to have come to Canada for the sole purpose of obtaining protection. He was assisted by a smuggler, and shortly after his arrival, he began attending a church. In these particular circumstances, I concur with the reasoning provided by the RPD that the Appellant's seven-month delay in initiating his refugee claim undermined the Appellant's credibility, particularly with respect to the events that purportedly led to his departure from China. The RPD member appropriately asked the Appellant why he had not made his claim sooner. Having reviewed the Appellant's explanations, I conclude that the RPD did not err in finding them insufficient. I adopt as my own the RPD's reasoning in this regard.\nThe RPD's assessment of the Appellant's religious beliefs\n[12] The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in its approach to evaluating the genuineness of his religious beliefs. More specifically, he argues that the RPD failed to comply with the jurisprudence which prohibits decision-makers from evaluating religious belief through a fine-grained testing of a claimant's knowledge of religious doctrine.8\n[13] At the outset of its analysis, the RPD signaled that it was aware of the pitfalls associated with testing the sincerity of religious belief through knowledge-based questions. The member stated in part:\n... I have been careful to ask the claimant questions about the aspects of his religion that he himself says are important to his alleged Christian affiliation, and I have also given him the opportunity to provide a more subjective or personal description of the impact of his alleged beliefs on his own life. ...9\n[14] With this approach in mind, the RPD concluded that the Appellant did not demonstrate \"a reasonably-expected level of knowledge about Christianity.\"\n[15] In my view, the RPD accurately described an acceptable approach to the difficult task of assessing religious belief through a probing of doctrinal knowledge. It is not an approach based on objective benchmarks of expected knowledge, but is rather a subjective exploration into the specific aspects of a religion that are self-identified as being important to the refugee claimant. Thus, the RPD accurately articulated the correct approach to assessing the genuineness of religious belief. The question for the RAD to determine, however, is whether the RPD actually followed this approach.\n[16] The RPD commenced its analysis by noting that the Appellant is relatively well-educated and claimed to have read the Bible more or less daily since 2011. In light of these facts, the RPD stated that it was \"reasonable to expect that in his particular circumstances he should have a strong knowledge of the Bible.\"10\n[17] With this as a departure point, the RPD asked the Appellant about his activities in spreading the Gospel, about his favorite passages in the Old and New Testaments, about basic Christian principles such as the resurrection, and about the differences between the various Christian denominations and Chinese state-based churches.\n[18] The RPD found the Appellant's answers to these questions to be, while superficially accurate, lacking in nuance and personal engagement. The member found that, all told, the Appellant had demonstrated only a limited knowledge of the Bible and of key Christian teachings, and he was not able to express a personal response to his alleged religion. This inability, the RPD further found, demonstrated a lack of genuineness in the Appellant's alleged beliefs. Once again, the RPD reiterated that this finding was not based on a lack of religious knowledge, per se, but on a lack of knowledge and personal connection that one would expect of someone with the level of devotion asserted by the Appellant.\n[19] I have deliberated over the Appellant's testimony with respect to his religious knowledge and the RPD's response to this testimony. I find that, at times, the RPD did \"veer toward trivia\"11 in its approach to questioning the Appellant; for example, it spontaneously asked the Appellant what the letter of Romans was about and whether he could name any verses from it. It also asked the Appellant to name the last book of the Bible and who wrote it.\n[20] This having been said, I find that, in general, the RPD's questioning was restricted to open-ended questions about the importance of Christianity to the Appellant and how he applied Christian principles to his daily life. On balance, I am satisfied that the RPD did not engage in a microscopic or superficially fact-driven analysis of the Appellant's religious knowledge.12 This being the case, the RPD did not err in finding that the Appellant did not have the level of knowledge that one would expect of someone who had devoted himself to the extent claimed by the Appellant.\n[21] But what does this lack of expected knowledge tell us about the sincerity of the Appellant's beliefs? On this, central question, I part ways with the reasons of the RPD. As the Federal Court noted in Zhang, a failure to answer a question about a particular aspect of religious dogma, even a relatively straightforward one, might have multiple explanations, several of which may be completely unrelated to the sincerity of a person's beliefs.13 As such, I find that the RPD erred in concluding that the Appellant's level of religious knowledge displayed a lack of genuineness in his Christian beliefs.\n[22] The above leads me to conclude as follows with respect to the RPD's findings on the Appellant's religious beliefs: i) the RPD did not err in finding that the Appellant's level of knowledge was, on balance, inconsistent with his own claims as to the length and depth of his religious practice; and ii) the RPD did err in its conclusions on the genuineness of the Appellant's beliefs.\n[23] As a result of these findings, I am willing to accept, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant may hold a genuine religious belief in Christianity. Beyond this finding, however, I have further concluded that the RPD did not err in questioning the Appellant's claims with respect to the extent, scope, and frequency of his religious practice.\nIndependent Assessment of Risk\n[24] In the above paragraphs, I have concluded that the RPD did not err in finding that the Appellant's delay in initiating a refugee claim in Canada gave rise to serious credibility concerns related to the events that allegedly led to his departure from China.\n[25] I have also concluded that, while the Appellant may have a genuine belief in Christianity, the RPD did not err in finding that his claimed level of engagement with the religion was inconsistent with his oral testimony.\n[26] These conclusions require me to consider the risk that the Appellant may face should he return to China. The RPD did not engage in such an assessment because of its conclusion that the Appellant was not credible with regard to any element of his claimed Christian affiliation. Without any Christian profile to speak of, there was no need to consider the documentary evidence on the treatment of Christians in China.\n[27] As I have accepted, for the sake of this appeal, that the Appellant may genuinely hold Christian beliefs, I must consider his profile as such. For the reasons that I have articulated above, I do not accept, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant has come to the attention of Chinese authorities, or that he has dedicated himself to the practice of his religion, as he has alleged.\n[28] With this profile in mind, I have engaged in my own assessment of the documentary evidence. Having done so, I conclude that the Appellant has not established that he faces a serious possibility of persecution should he return to China.\n[29] At the outset of this part of my analysis, I recognize that religious persecution is a reality in China. The United States Department of State has designated China one of ten countries of particular concern in regard to religious freedom and reports of persecutory treatment, particularly of those designated as belonging to \"evil cults\" are widespread.14\n[30] There is not a consensus as to the number of Protestants in China, though by any measure it is a sizable population. The documentary evidence suggests that there are somewhere between 50 to 90 million Protestants in the country, the majority of whom worship at unregistered churches. The documentary evidence also suggests that, in a country the size of China, the situation for Christians is not uniform or unchanging.15\n[31] This said, I take the following to be relatively uncontroversial. First, unregistered Protestant groups are not generally equated with groups, such as Falun Gong, that have been declared by the Chinese state to be evil cults. China clearly views such groups as posing a threat to the state and engages in widespread persecution of their adherents.\n[32] Second, there are few formal doctrinal differences between the state-sanctioned Protestant churches and unregistered house churches, and many individuals attend both. However, a large number of Protestants reject the overt influence of the Communist party in the state-sanctioned churches.16\n[33] Third, state-sanctioned churches vary widely in their specific practices.17 There are roughly 60,000 Protestant churches in China that provide services for a wide variety of congregants.18\n[34] Fourth, in many parts of China, unregistered groups have grown rapidly, and the authorities do not pressure them to register. 19\n[35] Fifth, there continue to be multiple reports of the destruction of Protestant sites and the arrest of house church members. Those arrested tend to be pastors and other church leaders.20\n[36] Sixth, reports of religious repression vary widely throughout China. On this, I would note that, with the exception of an arrest of a pastor in 2013, there are relatively few reports of state interference in Protestant congregations in the Appellant's home province of Henan. Other reports state that the Protestant church is \"strong\" in Henan province, with one particular church - the Fangcheng church, claiming to have 10 million followers.21\n[37] Taking the above into consideration, I find that Protestants are not persecuted, per se, in China. As previously noted, there are tens of thousands of unregistered churches in China, most of which carry out their business with little, if any, trouble from the local authorities. This is not to say that the Chinese state does not engage in repression of Protestants; it clearly has engaged in persecutory acts against some religious leaders and others who have become specifically associated with a house church that has been deemed unacceptable.\n[38] This finding does mean, however, that the fact of being a Protestant in China does not, on its own, raise a serious possibility of persecution. This finding is supported by the United Kingdom Home Office, which has stated that \"[i]n general the treatment faced by Christians in China, including those from unregistered churches, is unlikely to amount to persecution.\"22\n[39] To make out a claim of persecution, then, a Protestant from China must establish, with credible evidence, something beyond the mere fact of being a Protestant. In applying this understanding of the country conditions to the facts that arise in this appeal, I conclude that the Appellant has not established that he faces a serious possibility of persecution were he to return to China.\n[40] I come to this conclusion based on the aspects of the RPD's decision that I have upheld on appeal, most notably the finding that the Appellant's claim that he was wanted by the PSB lacked credibility. With the sustainable RPD findings in mind, I conclude that the Appellant has not established that there is any aspect of his profile that would single him out from the tens of millions of Protestants in China, who practice their religion in a manner that is both consistent with their conscience and free from a serious possibility of persecution.\nCONCLUSION\n[41] The RAD dismisses the appeal and confirms the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection, pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the IRPA.\n(signed)\n\"Angus Grant\"\nAngus Grant\nFebruary 5, 2019\nDate\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD File \/ Dossier de la SAR : TB8-00943\nRAD.25.02 (September 18, 2018)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n2\nImmigration and Refugee\nBoard of Canada\nRefugee Appeal Division\nCommission de l'immigration\net du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 du Canada\nSection d'appel des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s\nRAD.25.02 (September 18, 2018)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (Principal Appellant), his wife XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and their minor son, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (Associate Appellants), citizens of Mexico, appealed a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD), dated June 10, 2019, rejecting their claims for refugee protection.\nBACKGROUND AND OVERVIEW OF APPEAL\n[2] The Appellants alledge that they were victims of threats and extortion by members of the Jalisco Nueva Generacion drug cartel (Jalisco Cartel), who wanted to obtain a list of clients who XXXX XXXX XXXX where the Principal Appellant worked as a XXXX XXXX. The threats began in XXXX 2017. The Appellants left Mexico on XXXX XXXX, 2017, and arrived in Canada the same day. They claimed refugee protection on November 17, 2017.\n[3] The Appellants' claim for refugee protection was heard by the RPD on May 7, 14, and 21, 2019 and rejected in written reasons dated June 10, 2019.The RPD Member identified the determinative factor to be credibility.\n[4] The Appellants were not represented by Counsel at the RPD hearing or in this appeal.\n[5] The Minister did not intervene at the RPD or in this appeal.\n[6] The Appellants have not challenged the credibility determination of the RPD Member nor have they clearly identified what constitutes any error in the RPD decision rejecting their claim. In the Principal Appellant's Application for an Extension of Time to Perfect the Appeal, he stated, \"I need the extension of time for the Commissioner to review in detail the operation of the Jalisco cartel and the real danger that my family and I have if we return [to Mexico].\" In the appeal record, the Principal Appellant states that the risk to him and his family is real as his cousin XXXX was beheaded by the Jalisco Cartel in 2011 by not collaborating with them. He also alleged that his brother was also assaulted, threatened and beaten by gang members who confused his brother with the Principal Appellant.\n[7] While the Appellants have not clearly identified what remedy they seek in this appeal, it is deemed that they have requested that the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) set aside the determination of the RPD and find that the Appellants are Convention refugees or persons in need of protection or alternatively refer the matter back to the RPD for redetermination by another Member.\n[8] I find that the determinative issue in this appeal is credibility.\nNEW EVIDENCE AND ORAL HEARING\n[9] The Appellants seek to enter new evidence in this appeal. Section 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)1 provides that an Appellant may present only evidence that arose after the rejection of their claim, or that was not reasonably available, or that they could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection.\n[10] Should the new evidence meet the statutory requirement outlined above, I will also consider the \"Raza2 principles\" as modified by Federal Court of Appeal in Singh.3 It directs the RAD to consider the credibility and relevance of the document in addition to the newness of the evidence.\n[11] The Appellants have not submitted any documentation as new evidence as required under the Refugee Appeal Division Rules (RAD Rules)4 but have included in the appeal record references to internet web links to two websites. The first website link refers to the alleged execution of his cousin XXXX by the Jalisco Cartel in 2011. The second internet web link was referenced as \"The leader of the Jalisco cartel wants to submit to the judicial Authority\".\n[12] I first note that any submission of new evidence must be in printed form not a simple reference to an internet web link. Secondly, I note that the Appellants have not made any submission as to how this evidence would meet the requirements of constituting new evidence as required under section 110(4) of IRPA. I further note that the Appellants did not refer to the murder of the Principal Appellant's cousin or any connection to their claim in their Basis of Claim (BOC) Forms or in testimony at the RPD hearing.\n[13] The request for new evidence has not been made in compliance with the RAD Rules and there have been no submissions to indicate how this evidence would meet the requirements of constituting new evidence as required under section 110(4) of IRPA. I therefore decline to accept these references to internet websites as new evidence in this appeal.\n[14] The Appellants have not requested an oral hearing. Under section 110(6) of the IRPA, the RAD can only consider ordering a hearing when new evidence has been accepted and that new evidence raises a serious issue with respect to credibility. This appeal will therefore proceed without an oral hearing.\nROLE OF THE RAD\n[15] With respect to questions of fact, mixed fact and law, I have applied the standard of correctness as per Huruglica.5\n[16] I have analyzed this appeal based on documents submitted by the Appellant and all of the evidence contained in the RPD Record.\n[17] In this appeal, I find that the RPD did not have any real advantage in assessing the credibility that would lead to deference to its finding regarding it. The RPD does not state that there were any difficulties with the Appellants' testimony where the RPD would have been in a better position than the RAD to judge it.\nANALYSIS\n[18] As noted above, the Appellants have not challenged the credibility determination of the RPD Member nor have they clearly identified what constitutes any error in the RPD decision rejecting their claim. The RPD Member found the Principal Appellant not credible with respect to key elements of his refugee protection claim, and therefore did not believe the allegation that he was threatened by members of the Jalisco Cartel. As his wife and minor son based their claims for refugee protection on that of the Principal Appellant, the RPD Member did not believe the allegations made by his wife and son.\n[19] In making this credibility finding, the RPD Member noted what she considered to be key omissions in the Principal Appellant's BOC Form and contradictions in his testimony, involving key allegations such as when the first encounters with gang members occurred and when the gang members started giving him and his family death threats.\n[20] In the Principal Appellant's Application for an Extension of time to Perfect the Appeal, he stated, \"I need the extension of time for the commissioner to review in detail the operation of the Jalisco cartel and the real danger that my family and I have if we return [to Mexico]\". In the appeal record, the principal appellant states that the risk to him and his family is real as his cousin XXXX was beheaded by the Jalisco Cartel for not collaborating with them. He also alleged that his brother was also assaulted, threatened and beaten by gang members who confused his brother with the Principal Appellant. I note that the alleged incidents involving his brother and cousin were not referred to in his BOC Form or in testimony at the hearing.\n[21] The RPD Member found the Principal Appellant was not credible with respect to key elements of his refugee protection claim, and therefore did not believe the allegation that he and family members threatened by members of the Nueva Generacion Cartel. Based on my independent review of the evidence and on the balance of probabilities, I agree with this finding by the RPD Member. I therefore dismiss this appeal on the same grounds as the RPD Member as I have also found on the balance of probabilities that the Appellants' allegations are not credible.\nCONCLUSION\n[22] The RAD dismisses the appeal and confirms the decision of the RPD that the Appellants are neither Convention6 refugees nor persons in need of protection, pursuant to section 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n(signed)\n\"Douglas Bruce Fortney\"\nDouglas Bruce Fortney\nFebruary 7, 2020\nDate\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD File \/ Dossier de la SAR : MB9-15394\nMB9-15395 \/ MB9-15396\nRAD.25.02 (January, 2020)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n2\nImmigration and Refugee\nBoard of Canada\nRefugee Appeal Division\nCommission de l'immigration\net du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 du Canada\nSection d'appel des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s\nRAD.25.02 (January, 2020)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n",

Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2011 FC 39 (CanLII).\nDETERMINATION OF THE APPEAL\n[6] The Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) dismisses the appeal and confirms the RPD's determination according to which XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection, pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the IRPA.\nROLE OF THE REFUGEE APEAL DIVISION\n[7] The RAD reviews RPD decisions after carrying out its own analysis of the record by applying the correctness standard of review.1 The exception to this rule is in a situation where the RPD enjoys a meaningful advantage; the RAD may then show deference.2\n[8] The panel will apply the correctness standard in conducting an independent analysis of the record, which includes examining all of the evidence and listening to the recording.\nANALYSIS\n[9] The determinative issue is credibility.\n[10] The RPD concluded that Ms. XXXX and her former spouse (with whom she still has not completed a division of assets in the context of their divorce) owned land, on a balance of probabilities. This conclusion is not the subject of the appeal. The panel considers it to be correct and supports it.\n[11] The third parties who were planning to take ownership of her property pressured her by\n- intimidating the guard on the property\n- making threats over the telephone on several occasions\n- intimidating her at her workplace\nContradictions and omissions were noted regarding the events of April 7, 2017, and April 28, 2017\n(a) Events of April 7, 2017\n[12] The first event that made Ms. XXXX aware of the interest in her property occurred on April 7, 2017. That day, four strangers allegedly went to her property to banish the guard and inform him that they were now the owners. According to her testimony, her guard allegedly notified her of what had happened at around midnight. She then allegedly went to the police station to file a complaint, in which she indicated that she received a call from someone with a deep voice threatening her at around 10:00 a.m. However, her written account indicates that she got the call from the person with the deep voice in the evening.\n[13] When confronted about the number of calls she supposedly received according to the police report, her account and her testimony, she indicated that she received two calls the same day. When asked why one of the calls was not mentioned in her account, she indicated that she considered the first threat to be more important and that she did not remember having received two telephone threats the same day.\n[14] The RPD found that her credibility was undermined because, since it was the first event, it did not make sense that she would not remember it.\n[15] The appeal memorandum argues that this was a minor omission, which was explained in a satisfactory manner.\n[16] The RPD's finding about Ms. XXXX credibility in light of this observation regarding the number of calls received is correct for the following reasons:\n- Her account refers to one call received in the evening.\n- She testified that she received a call from her guard, who told her of the situation that had occurred.\n- Her statement to the police describes an unknown call that was received in the morning, at around 10:00 a.m.\n[17] Ms. XXXX account does not mention the first threatening telephone call, which is the starting point of her problems. She also did not mention it during her testimony. It was only when she was confronted with the contradiction\/omission that she referred to a second call that same day, although her different versions only address one call, which took place either in the evening or in the morning. It makes no sense that she would not remember her first contact with her agents of persecution, especially if there were two interactions on the same day.\n(b) Events of April 28, 2017\n[18] The contradiction noted by the RPD relates to the identity of the individual who made the threatening telephone calls to Ms. XXXX on April 28, 2017. Her account talks about an individual with a different voice from the one she heard on the call of April 7, 2017. Her police statement of May 1, 2017, regarding the event of April 28, 2017, indicates that it was the same voice as the voice from the previous threatening call. When asked about this, her only explanation was that the threats were the same, which is why she did not indicate it.\n[19] The appeal memorandum indicates that the crux of her problems was the occupation of her property and that the identity of the individuals threatening her was less important.\n[20] The RPD's conclusion is correct. Ms. XXXX was not able to explain the contradiction between identifying a speaker as being different from a previous one and later declaring that they were the same for the purposes of an official document. Indicating that the importance comes from the nature of the threat rather than the identity of the person making the threat does not justify this contradiction.\nInconsistency regarding the threats received at her workplace\n[21] Two individuals allegedly went to her workplace on June 9, 2017, and intimidated a guard, suggesting that they would return another time and there would be more of them. The account\n- does not mention a telephone call that she allegedly received that same day, at around 11:00 a.m.;\n- mentions only the one she received in the evening on her new number, when the caller claimed to have visited her workplace; and\n- describes the incident that allegedly occurred at the office around 2:00 p.m.\n[22] She went to the police station the following morning, on June 10, 2017, and filed a complaint only about the call received that day. She did not report the two calls supposedly received the evening before or the visit of the individuals who were looking for her at her workplace.\n[23] When confronted with the omissions of these significant events in her police statement, she explained that the events reported previously to police officers were practically the same.\n[24] The RPD did not believe the testimony, given the importance of this alleged event and its effect on her fear, which led her to flee.\n[25] The appeal memorandum states that little importance should be given to this part of her experience because the event is the one that, triggered Ms. XXXX need to leave and it was a microscopic examination of the situation.\n[26] The panel does not agree with the submissions in the appeal. It makes no sense for Ms. XXXX to take the time to go to the police station to file a complaint regarding the telephone call she received that day while remaining silent about the individuals' visit to her workplace, as well as a prior call and a call in the evening claiming the visit.\n[27] Given that it was the first visit, its omission cannot be explained by arguing that it was essentially the same thing. According to the facts, the telephone call that drove her to go to the police was the only event that was similar to the previous ones. According to her police statement, this was the third call, following the ones on April 7 and 28, 2017.\n[28] Thus, in light of this contradiction regarding her failure to report the incident the night before in her police report of June 10, 2017, the RPD's credibility finding regarding Ms. XXXX is correct.\nThe conclusion regarding the fear of rape ignored the Chairperson's Guideline 4 as well as the principles in Josile v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2011 FC 39.\n[29] Ms. XXXX last argument is that she also fears being raped if she were to return to Haiti.\n[30] The RPD concluded that there was no serious possibility of persecution because of the following:\n- The events of June 9, 2017, on which her fear is based, were found not credible.\n- She was able to live peacefully for two years and five months.\n- She has not shown that she would not receive protection from the rest of her family, if she were to return.\n[31] The appeal memorandum stipulates that the RPD erred in downplaying the issue of the risk of rape for a single woman simply because she lived for two years and five months without being a victim of it.\n[32] It is appropriate to quote Justice Pinard in Dezameau regarding Ms. XXXX argument that she faces a risk of persecution by reason of her membership in a particular social group (women):\nThis is not to say that membership in a particular social group is sufficient to result in a finding of persecution. The evidence provided by the applicant must still satisfy the Board that there is a risk of harm that is sufficiently serious and whose occurrence is \"more than a mere possibility.\"3\n[33] Taking into consideration the Chairperson's Guideline 4, once it is acknowledged that a risk of rape is grounded in her membership in a particular social group, the inquiry must result in a decision on the issue of whether there is a serious possibility that Ms. XXXX may be persecuted as a woman if she were to return to Haiti.\n[34] Ms. XXXX lived in Haiti for many years without any other issues. She was able to earn a good living during the 14 years that she was a member of Haiti's XXXX XXXX. Her work gave her financial independence and access to a well-established network. She receives family support from a sister, half-sister and father, who still live in Haiti.\n[35] Lastly, according to her testimony, she began to be afraid after the individuals visited her workplace. However, at no time did she find it worthwhile to mention this event to the police officers when she filed a complaint for the telephone threat that she received the following day. Given that this event was found to lack credibility, it follows that the fear that could be caused by an event that is not believed must also lack credibility. As a result, the RPD's finding that there is no serious possibility that they would be persecuted is correct.\n[36] Ms. XXXX credibility was also undermined by contradictions on the following aspects:\n- The times when the various calls were received\n- The number of calls received\n- The sequence of events regarding the visit to her workplace\n- The different identities of the callers\nHer failure to declare the event that triggered her fear while taking the trouble to report another call adds to her lack of credibility. As a result, the lack of credibility regarding the event that led to her fear also makes this fear not very credible, such that the RPD's finding regarding Ms. XXXX credibility is correct.\nMinor child\n[37] No argument was made against the decision regarding the minor child. XXXX XXXX XXXX is a citizen of the United States and no fear was alleged against this country. I agree with the RPD and, in my opinion, the conclusion is correct.\nCONCLUSION\n[38] The RAD dismisses the appeal and confirms the RPD's determination according to which XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection, pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the IRPA.\n(signed)\nRichard Sheitoyan\nMe Richard Sheitoyan\nSeptember 25, 2019\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD File No. \/ No de dossier de la SAR: MB8-20810\nMB8-20811\nRAD.25.02 (April 4, 2019)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n7\nImmigration and Refugee\nBoard of Canada\nRefugee Appeal Division\nCommission de l'immigration et du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 du Canada\nSection d'appel des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s\nRAD.25.02 (April 4, 2019)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] XXXX XXXX(the Appellant) and XXXX XXXX(the male Appellant) citizens of China, appeal a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) denying their claim for refugee protection. The Appellants appealed a decision of the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) rejecting their claim for refugee protection to the Federal Court of Canada. The Federal Court set aside the RAD decision and their appeal was remitted back to the RAD for reconsideration with a different decision-maker.\n[2] The Appellants have submitted new evidence with the appeal as referred to in Section 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)1 and they do not request an oral hearing be held pursuant to Section 110(6) of the IRPA. The Appellants ask that the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) set aside the decision of the RPD and substitute a decision with its own determination that the Appellants are Convention refugees or persons in need of protection. In the alternative, the Appellants request that the RAD refer the matter back to the RPD with a differently constituted panel.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] Pursuant to section 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the RAD confirms the determination of the RPD and dismisses the appeal.\nBACKGROUND\n[4] The Appellant alleged before the RPD that she began practicing Falun Gong in XXXX2015 after suffering from insomnia. She joined a group practice in XXXX2015 and as she continued to practice in the group and at home, her insomnia was less frequent.\n[5] The Appellant distributed leaflets with other group members on XXXX XXXX, 2015. She was again asked to distribute leaflets on XXXX XXXX, 2015 but declined as she thought that the bus terminal where they planned to distribute material was too busy. A fellow practitioner was arrested while distributing leaflets and the claimant received a call from another practitioner who advised her to go into hiding.\n[6] The Appellant went into hiding at a relative's home. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, the PSB (Public Safety Bureau) went to her home looking for her and two days later they returned with a summons. The Appellants hired a snakehead or smuggler to help them obtain US visas. They left China September 23, 2015 with the smuggler.\n[7] The Appellant's hearing for refugee protection was on January 8, 2016. In a decision of January 26, 2016, the RPD rejected the Appellant's claim finding that the Appellant was not credible. The Appellant submits that the RPD erred in drawing its credibility findings and in its treatment of the documentary evidence.\nROLE OF THE RAD\n[8] The RAD finds that the Federal Court of Appeal decision, in Huruglica,2 provides the RAD with guidance in relation to the appropriate standard that must be applied by a specialized tribunal, such as the RAD, to decisions of a first-level administrative tribunal.\n[9] The RAD concludes from its statutory analysis that, with respect to findings of fact (and mixed fact and law), the RAD is to review RPD decisions applying the correctness standard. Thus, after carefully considering the RPD's decision, the RAD carries out its own analysis of the record to determine whether, as submitted by the Appellant, the RPD erred.\nADMISSIBILITY OF NEW EVIDENCE PRESENTED ON APPEAL\n[10] As provided for in s.110 (3) of the IRPA, with certain exceptions, the RAD must proceed without a hearing, on the basis of the record of the proceedings of the RPD and may accept documentary evidence and written submissions from the Minister and refugee claimant. Section 110(4) of the IRPA provides that the person who is the subject of the appeal may present only evidence that arose after the rejection of their claim or that was not reasonably available, or that the person could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection.\n[11] The Appellant submits the following document as new evidence:\n(a) An article produced by Peng & Weber, U.S. Immigration Lawyers, entitled \"Security Checks for Nonimmigrant Visa Processing\".3\n[12] The RAD's analysis of the admissibility of the proposed new evidence must begin first with the test set out in s. 110(4). While the RAD agrees with the Appellants that further analysis of the evidence is required before the RAD can accept the proposed new evidence, the analysis as set out in Raza4 is not entirely appropriate for the purpose of assessing evidence submitted to the RAD. In this regard, the RAD is guided by the Federal Court of Appeal decision in Singh.5\n[13] Accordingly, the RAD has adapted the analysis in Raza6 to the assessment of evidence submitted to the RAD.\n[14] In assessing whether the proposed new evidence meets the statutory provisions of s. 110(4), the RAD considered the following:\n(a) First, did the evidence arise after the rejection of the Appellant's refugee claim? Here, the RAD may consider whether the evidence is capable of proving the current state of affairs in the country of feared persecution, or an event that occurred or a circumstance that arose after the rejection of the refugee claim.7\n(b) The RAD will consider not only the date on which the document came into existence, but the timing of the event or circumstance which the document seeks to prove.8 For example, an affidavit or newspaper article may have been created after the rejection of the Appellant's refugee claim, but the information in the document may be several years old, and the RAD may therefore find that the evidence did not arise after the rejection of the claim, despite the date of the document.\n(c) It is important to note here that s. 110(4) does not contemplate whether the evidence arose after the RPD hearing, but rather after the rejection of the Appellant's claim. Where a document arose after the hearing but before the rejection of the refugee claim, it is necessary for the RAD to consider whether the Appellant could have presented the document to the RPD by way of a post-hearing submission.\n(d) If the evidence is capable of proving an event that occurred or circumstances that arose after the RPD hearing, then the evidence must be considered, and the RAD will proceed to assess the credibility, relevance, and materiality of the document.9\n(e) Second, if the RAD finds that the evidence did not arise after the rejection of the Appellant's refugee claim, it must consider the next factor in s. 110(4). If the evidence is capable of proving only an event that occurred or circumstances that arose prior to the rejection, has the Appellant established that the evidence was not reasonably available for presentation to the RPD before it rejected the claim,10 or that it proves a fact that was unknown to him at the time of the hearing?11 If so, the RAD will proceed to assess the newness, credibility and relevance of the evidence.\n(f) Third, if the RAD finds that the evidence did not arise after the rejection of the Appellant's refugee claim, and that it was reasonably available at the time of the rejection, it must consider the final part of the s. 110(4) test: could the Appellant reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented the evidence prior to the rejection of the refugee claim? If so, the evidence need not be considered.12 If the Appellant could not reasonably have been expected to present the evidence to the RPD, the RAD will proceed to assess the newness, credibility, and relevance of the evidence.\n(g) If the proposed new evidence meets the tests set out in the statutory requirements and in Raza,13 the evidence will be admitted as evidence in the appeal. The materiality of the evidence will be considered in the context of the assessment made under section 110(6) of the IRPA.\n[15] For these reasons, the RAD will apply the following factors to considering the Appellant's proposed new evidence. It will first consider whether the evidence passes the test in Section 110(4). If not, the RAD has no discretion to admit the evidence. If the evidence meets the requirements of Section 110(4), the RAD will assess its credibility and relevance in order to determine whether it is admissible.\n[16] The RAD notes the document submitted by the Appellants is undated. The RAD is, unable to determine when it was written. The Appellants submit that the issue of their ability to obtain a US visa and bypass the US Embassy security checks was not put to the Appellants at the RPD hearing and it is submitted that the Appellants ought to be able to tender new evidence in response to the issue at the appeal. The RAD notes this submission appears to be based on an acknowledgement that the document was produced prior to the RPD hearing.\n[17] The Appellants submit that this document should be accepted in evidence as it refutes a factual error made by the RPD, that the female Appellant would not have been able to obtain a US visa since the US authorities would have carried out a security check that would have shown the female Appellant was wanted by the Chinese authorities. The RAD agrees that the Appellant could not have anticipated that that the RPD would draw an adverse credibility finding on this issue and as such could not reasonably have tendered the document prior to the rejection of the claim. The RAD finds the document meets the basic requirements of section 110(4) and is admitted into evidence.\nOral Hearing\n[18] According to Section 110(6), upon which the Appellants rely, the RAD may hold a hearing if, in its opinion, there is documentary evidence referred to in 110(3) that raises a serious issue with respect to the credibility of the Appellants, that is central to the RPD's decision, and that, if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the refugee protection claim. In this appeal, where there is no evidence from or in response to the Minister, the documentary evidence referred to in Section 110(3) must be understood in relation to Section 110(4).\n[19] When read together, Sections 110(3), (4), and (6) establish that the RAD must not hold a hearing in an appeal such as this unless there is new (Section 110(4)) evidence, in which case the RAD may hold a hearing if that new evidence raises a serious issue with respect to the credibility of the Appellants, is central to the RPD's decision, and that, if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the refugee protection claim.\n[20] The RAD has reviewed the document14 and notes that it addresses the \"likely\" (RAD's emphasis) nature of the security checks conducted by the US authorities. The RAD notes that the document does not reference the source of its information, but it does indicate that \"Consular officials also search the National Crime Information Center (\"NCIC\") database for information on criminal convictions before issuing a visa.\" The RAD has considered that the \"NCIC\" is a US database and there is no reference to support any finding that the US authorities have access to a Chinese criminal database. The document also states that heightened security checks are conducted in additional circumstances:\nHeightened Security Checks\nThe specific criteria for Visa Condor checks are classified. However, these checks are likely (RAD's emphasis) based on several factors:\nThe information that may trigger greater scrutiny include unexplained travel to predominantly Muslim countries in the last 10 years, prior employment in sensitive areas, military service for certain nationals, or specialized skills or training that may have military or security implications. This information would be disclosed on Form DS-157, which is required for men between the ages of 16 and 45 years old, and for all applicants age 16 and over who are from Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria.\nYour country of birth, citizenship, or residence may also require a Visa Condor check. If you were born in a \"T-7\" or \"List of 26\" country, you will likely be subject to a Condor security check.\nNOTE: The T-7 countries include Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North, Korea, Sudan and Syria. The List of 26 countries are Afghanistan, Algeria, Bahrain, Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Malaysia, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen.\n[21] The RAD notes that \"China\" is not listed as a \"T-7\" or \"List of 26\" country that would be deserving of additional screening. The RAD in its review of the evidence finds that this document has drawn its information from sources that have not been fully identified. The RAD finds this document is not capable of confirming or denying the situation the Appellant submits without additional speculation by the RAD. The RAD finds it can place little evidentiary weight on this document.\n[22] The RAD notes that although new evidence has been admitted in this appeal it must proceed without a hearing. The RAD finds it can place little evidentiary weight on the document and at its best it provides a description of a number of parameters the US authorities potentially utilize in performing security checks on visa applicants. Accordingly, the evidence lacks the materiality to justify either allowing or rejecting the refugee protection claim, and, as such, it does not meet the requirements of s.110(6). Each of the requirements in s.110(6)(a) through (c) have to be met, and in this case the requirement in s.110(6)(c) is not met. As such, the RAD has no discretion to hold a hearing.\nANALYSIS OF THE MERITS OF THE APPEAL\nDid the RPD Err in its Assessment of the Appellant's Credibility Findings?\n[23] The Appellants submit that the RPD erred in drawing an adverse credibility finding in relation to:\n* The Appellants ability to exit China\n* The failure to assess the Appellants supporting documents.\n* Finding the Summons was fraudulent.\n* The Appellant's Falun Gong Identity.\n* The Appellant's failure to contact the Falun Dafa Association.\n* The Appellants' failure to initiate a refugee claim at first opportunity.\n* The Appellants acquisition of US Visas.\nExit from China\n[24] The RPD found that the Appellants exited China on their own identity documents, thus confirming that the authorities were not concerned with them and additionally undermining the female claimant's identity as a Falun Gong practitioner who is wanted by the PSB. The Appellants submit that the RPD erred in drawing a negative inference against their credibility because they were able to leave China using their own passports. They argue that the RPD overlooked case law that resolves the issue that a person wanted by the authorities would be able to escape the country using his\/her own passport. The Appellants further argue that the RPD did not consider that smugglers can bypass the systems by bribing the official with access to those computer systems.\n[25] The RAD is not persuaded by the Appellants' argument in this regard. The RAD finds, after its own assessment of the evidence, that it agrees with the RPD that the Appellants could not have left China using their genuine passports given the allegations that the PSB wanted to arrest them.\n[26] The documentary evidence reveals that the Chinese government has a national computer network known as the Golden Shield Project,15 and the PSB has access to a national policing database, which includes information about criminal fugitives and information on passports and exit and entry. The Golden Shield incorporated extensive tracking and control mechanisms including facial recognition surveillance technology.\n[27] The RAD also notes, from its own review and assessment of the evidence, that the Exit and Entry Administration Law of China, which came into force on 1 July 2013, states that:\nArticle 11. Chinese citizens who exit or enter China shall submit their exit\/entry documents such as passports or other travel documents to the exit\/entry border inspection authorities for examination, go through the prescribed formalities, and may exit or enter upon examination and approval.\n[28] Evidence in the National Documentation Package (NDP) from a Canadian Embassy official states that upon departure, a person may be requested to produce their passport four times in the airport. The embassy official also indicated that the passport is scanned at two of these times: at the airline check-in counter and at the immigration departure counter. The source mentioned that the passenger's airline ticket is scanned when entering the \"secure transit area\" and at the airline boarding gate.16\n[29] Furthermore, in correspondence with the Research Directorate, a representative of Air Canada who works in the area of airline facilitation indicated that upon check-in, the person's passport is scanned ... the machine-readable zone (MRZ) of the passport contains the advanced passenger information (API), which is gathered by the airline. Passengers leaving China must pass through exit immigration control points where passengers are seen by Chinese immigration agents prior to approaching the boarding gate.\n[30] In correspondence with the Research Directorate, an assistant director responsible for aviation security and facilitation at the International Air Transport Association (IATA) indicated that, to the best of the source's knowledge, the departure procedure at airports in China seems to involve three steps: 1) check-in; 2) immigration; and 3) security and that, at all three locations, passengers are required to show their passports. Usually, at check-in, the Advanced Passenger Information System (APIS) info is input, manually or through by scanning; at immigration by physical inspection, and at security checkpoint by matching passport info with boarding card for verification, either using barcode readers on the boarding pass or just a visual check (with a stamp on the boarding pass).17\n[31] The documentary evidence also states that Chinese citizens are not allowed to exit China if they are suspects or defendants in criminal cases. The same article states that:\nIf a foreigner or a Chinese citizen must be prevented from leaving China at a border control station, the people's court accepting the case shall report up the hierarchy to the High People's Court, and a written notification of preventing person from departing through entry-exit port shall be issued by the Highest People's Court, and work with the public security organ of the corresponding level for handle control formalities. If the control port is not within the same province, autonomous region, or municipality directly under the central government, the public security organ in the relevant province, autonomous region, or municipality directly under the central government shall be contacted for the handle control formalities. Under emergency situations, if necessary, may first have the border control prevent departure and complete control formalities later.18\n[32] The RAD further notes that the documentation states that security officials have access to the Public Security Bureau of China's online database of citizens who have been convicted of crimes or are wanted by the authorities (also known as Policenet or the Golden Shield).19 In particular, the RAD notes the documentary evidence clearly states the system has been used to track down Falun Gong practitioners. The Chinese economist writing in Open Magazine affirms that Cisco's Policenet has been helping the [Chinese Communist Party]'s public security organs to ferret out political dissidents and Falun Gong practitioners for years (17 Feb. 2010).20\nInformation Sharing by Public Security Officials\nIn 10 February 2014 correspondence with the Research Directorate, the Executive Director of the Dui Hua Foundation affirmed that airport security officials have access to the Public Security Bureau of China's online database of citizens who have been convicted of crimes or are wanted by the authorities [also known as Policenet or the Golden Shield]. Similarly, the representative of the Laogai Research Foundation stated that reports on \"experiences of activists who have been detained while trying to board an international flight provide clear evidence that airport officials are connected to Policenet\" (26 Feb. 2014). A colleague of Cao Shunli, who was also prevented from travelling to Geneva for the human rights training in September 2013, later publicized her own experience at the airport in Guangdong (HRIC 11 Oct. 2013). According to the Laogai research Foundation, the colleague indicates that when her passport was swiped by airport authorities,\nScanning equipment immediately made noises alerting airport officials that she was wanted by police. She was subsequently detained in the Guangdong Baiyun Airport and told that Shanghai police would not let her leave. She was then transported from Guangdong to Shanghai for detention and questioning. This woman's experience provides concrete evidence of airport officials coordinating with police departments in tracking and detaining a political dissident. (26 Feb. 2014)21\nSecurity and Exit Control Procedures\nThe representative of the Laogai Research Foundation wrote that the Chinese government checks the passports of citizens attempting to leave the country in order to ensure that they are suitable for foreign travel. Customs officials stamp the passports of citizens approved for foreign travel. Public security officials often confiscate passports held by individuals deemed unsuitable for foreign travel. (23 Feb. 2014).22\n[33] An undated article on the website of the Ministry of Public Security, entitled: \"Deepening the Implementation of the 'Golden Shield' Project\" describes:\nthat all police units nationwide have access to eight public security databases, including the \"National Basic Population Information Database\" (China n.d.). Also accessible through the databases is information on household registration [hukou], border exit and entry, road traffic, and criminal ininvestigations.23\nIn addition, the representative of the Laogai Research Foundation stated that the Golden Shield incorporates extensive tracking and control mechanisms such as real-name online registration requirements, GPS monitoring, and facial recognition surveillance technology in a multi-pronged approach to identify potentially disruptive individuals. Policenet, a component of the Golden Shield, stores a wealth of information on Chinese citizens and connects the various agencies and levels of command within the public security apparatus. This integrated system enables Chinese public security forces to effectively target and neutralize political dissidents.24\n[34] The Appellants submit that recent Federal Court decisions in Zhang, 25 Sun26 and Ren27to support their argument that the RPD's finding is unreasonable. The RAD has reviewed the record as well as the audio recording of the hearing and finds that the facts in Sun28 and Ren29 can be distinguished from the facts in the present case in that no evidence was advanced to establish that the \"smuggler\" bribed individuals at each of the security layers in place. The RAD notes that the Appellant's testimony was that the smuggler went to the airport with them and told them to put on sunglasses. The smuggler had a conversation with the customs officer at the counter. They acknowledged that they had carriage of their own passports and were screened and checked by border control officials.\n[35] The RAD in its review of the Appellant's testimony notes that her evidence in respect of the actions of the smuggler was vague and lacking in detail. The RAD further notes that the Appellant's BOC narrative states that she was aware of the risks of engaging in Falun Gong and only joined after she was confident there were security measures in place to ensure their safety. The RAD finds it is reasonable to expect that an individual who appears to take precautions and has regard for her personal safety would be cognizant engaging was able to provide and what steps would be taken to ensure his safe passage from China. is trying to avoid arrest and detention by leaving the country In light of this and given her apparent confidence and sophistication, it is reasonable to expect she would seek similar assurance from the \"snakehead\". The RAD finds it makes little sense that the Appellants would simply put their lives in the hands of an unknown smuggler without receiving detailed information on the plan that was to be undertaken to exit the country. The RAD finds that the lack of detail regarding the actions of the smuggler provided by the Appellants undermines his allegations that they were assisted by a smuggler to bypass security in China.\n[36] The RAD further finds that the facts in Ren30 can be distinguished from the present case suggestion, that bribing \"one person with a computer would be sufficient\" to allow the Appellant to exit China without difficulty, is not applicable in the circumstances of this case.\n[37] The RAD finds that the suggestion implies that one bribe could facilitate the removal of police interest in the Appellant from the Golden Shield computer system. The RAD notes that the Appellant alleges that the smuggler accompanied them throughout travel from China through a number of countries to Toronto. The RAD has considered that if the smuggler was able to bribe an official to alter computerized records of the police interest in the Appellant, it makes little sense that the smuggler would place himself at risk by accompanying the Appellants through the airport and onto the aircraft when there was no need. Furthermore, the RAD finds that the Appellants' allegation that the PSB have continued to look for them in China since their arrival in Canada undermines the argument that the Appellant's name would somehow be removed from the system.\n[38] The RAD finds that the circumstances in Zhang can be distinguished from the instant case. In Zhang, the reviewing court took issue with the RPD's findings that possibly hundreds of officials had to be bribed to facilitate undetected departure from China. The RAD notes that in the present case, the RPD did not engage in the speculation that numerous officials would have to be bribed. Additionally the RAD notes the decision in Zhang was based on the documentary evidence that existed in 2008 and made no reference to the Golden Shield Project, which was relied upon by the RPD in this case. In Zhang, the Federal Court made reference to a 2001 Response to Information Request, which addressed security and exit control procedures at Chinese airports. The RAD finds that the evidence relied upon by the RPD in the instant case is far more conclusive on the existence and capabilities of the Golden Shield.\n[39] The RAD in reviewing Federal Court decision in Sun notes it was determined in March 2015, in reference to an RPD decision in November 2013. A review of the RPD's decision confirms that it utilized documentary evidence available in the October 2012 NDP. In Sun, the Federal Court made reference to the RPD's reliance on an Information Request reporting the existence and expansion of a national Chinese policing database used by the PSB and at ports of entry and exit of the country and that the same document also mentions that challenges remain with respect to information sharing between regional police units.\n[40] The RAD notes, the findings in respect of the plausibility of the Appellant being able to leave China on her own passport in the present case are grounded on the most current information in the NDP. In addition, the RAD finds in its review of the evidence that the Golden Shield system is an extensive security apparatus that is far-reaching and encompassing. The RAD finds that, given the importance of this system to Chinese authorities in monitoring its citizens, it is reasonable to expect that the use of the apparatus is also monitored and that there are redundant systems in place to prevent the system from being compromised by a single individual.\n[41] The RAD additionally notes that the documentary evidence states:\nin 10 February 2014, correspondence with the Research Directorate, the Executive Director of the Dui Hua Foundation affirmed that \"airport security officials have access to the Public Security Bureau of China's online database of citizens who have been convicted of crimes or are wanted by the authorities [also known as Policenet or the Golden Shield]\" and that there is concrete evidence of airport officials coordinating with police departments in tracking and detaining wanted persons.31\n[42] The RAD has previously discussed that the Appellant alleges that the PSB have continued to show interest in vigorously pursuing her. The RAD finds it is reasonable to expect that the local authorities would have entered her information into the database to further their efforts to apprehend her.\n[43] The RAD acknowledges that there is evidence in the record, which establishes that there is corruption in China. The RAD notes that the Australian Refugee Review Tribunal's, Background Paper on Official Corruption in China and the other objective evidence in the record makes no mention that corruption extends to the airport security apparatus. The objective evidence states that corrupt practices are evident in many areas of Chinese society, but most sources agree that corruption problems are concentrated in sectors with extensive state involvement, such as construction, land use, infrastructure, property development and banking. The former Chinese Premier, Wen Jiabao, said in March 2012, \"corruption tends to occur frequently in departments that possess great power and in areas where the management of funds is centralised\".32\n[44] The RAD does not find the Appellants' evidence credible with respect to the Appellant's passage through the airport while being sought by the PSB. The RAD finds that the objective evidence concerning the Golden Shield and other border controls in place in China is compelling and convincing. While it might be possible for a smuggler to bypass some of the security controls, the RAD finds that, based on the evidence in the record, it is highly unlikely that the Appellant could have bypassed all of the security controls in place.\n[45] After its own review and assessment of the evidence, the RAD agrees with the RPD's findings and does not find it credible or plausible that the female Appellant was able to leave China on her own passport after coming to the attention of the PSB. The RAD further finds that this undermines the credibility of the allegations that she was being pursued by the PSB because of her Falun Gong activities.\nFailure to Assess Supporting Documents\nThe Summons\n[46] The RPD considered the summons33 submitted by the Appellant and found on a balance of probabilities it was not a genuine document. The Appellants submit that the RPD failed to assess the summons and discounted it based on prior credibility findings and the availability of fraudulent documents in China. The RAD is not persuaded by the argument of the Appellant.\n[47] The RAD notes that the Federal Court has addressed that the simple dismissal of a document such as the summons submitted in evidence based on the availability of fraudulent documents in China is unsupportable. The RAD has reviewed the record and notes that the RPD did consider a number of issues in its findings in respect of the summons:\n* The prior finding of the Appellant's ability to leave China with a genuine passport while alleging the PSB were seeking to arrest her.\n* The structure of the summons in respect of its simplicity of design and relative ease to create with simple word processing tools.\n* The ready availability of fraudulent documents in China.\n[48] The RAD has previously addressed the credibility finding in respect of the Appellant's ability to exit China and found it was compelling. The RAD finds the RPD did not simply dismiss the document based on the availability of fraudulent documents. Regardless of the allegations of error, the RAD has the ability and the expertise to examine documents and reach its own conclusions. As a result, the RAD will examine the documents and make a finding in relation to their authenticity.\n[49] The RAD has reviewed the summons and notes the Appellant has also submitted documentary evidence34 that has alleged that one of her fellow Falun Gong practitioners has been arrested and imprisoned. The RAD notes the summons submitted by the Appellant is consistent with the sample in the documentary evidence35 described as a Public Security summons. The RAD further notes that the document is based on articles found in the Public Security and Administrative Punishment Law of the Peoples Republic of China (PSAPL). The RAD has reviewed the articles that pertain to the summons issued to the Appellant.\nArticle 27 Anyone who commits any of the following acts may be detained for not less than 10 days but not more than 15 days, and may be concurrently fined not more than 1,000 yuan. If the circumstances are relatively lenient, he (she) shall be detained for not less than 5 days but not more than 10 days, and may be concurrently fined not more than 5,00 yuan:\n(1) Organizing, instigating, intimidating, inducing or inciting any other person to carry out activities of any cult or superstitious sect or secret society, or disturbing the social order or impairing the health of any other person by using any cult, or superstitious sect or secret society, or superstitious activity; or\n(2) Disturbing the social order or impairing the health of any other person in the name of any religion or Qigong36\n[50] The RAD notes that should the Appellant be charged and detained for the crime described in her summons the maximum sentence she would face is 15 days and a 1000 yuan fine. The RAD has considered the Appellant's allegation that her fellow practitioner has been arrested and imprisoned and she faces the same risk. The RAD finds if the Appellant's allegations are to be believed, the summons submitted in evidence is not a credible document.\n[51] In addition the RAD notes in its review of the audio recording of the hearing that the authorities have allegedly continue to inquire about the Appellant. The RAD finds it is reasonable to expect that considering the Appellant has not responded to the summons issued to her that the PSB would take further action to apprehend her. The Appellant's statements indicate that the PSB had far more than a casual interest in her. The RAD finds that the Appellant's testimony that the PSB continue to inquire about her but take no additional action, further detracts from the credibility of the document submitted in evidence.\n[52] The RAD notes that Article 82 specifically states that anyone who evades a summons can result in a compulsory summons37. The RAD further notes that the objective evidence38confirms that a coercive summons can be issued in cases of non-compliance. The RAD has examined the record and finds no evidence that the Appellant has tendered a coercive summons. The RAD finds that, given that the Chinese authorities view adherents of Falun Gong as members of a cult and in light of the objective evidence regarding the vigorous efforts the authorities undertake to pursue members of Falun Gong, and the Appellant's allegations of the arrest of co-practitioners and ongoing visits to her family home as well as the allegation that the PSB informed the Appellant's employer, it is reasonable to expect that a coercive summons would have been issued when the Appellant failed to report for the interview. The RAD finds that in light of the fact that the Appellant has testified that her family notified her about the issuance of the non-coercive summons, it is also reasonable to expect that if a coercive summons had been issued for the Appellant, her family would have notified her. The RAD finds that the absence of a compulsory summons when it is reasonable to expect that the Appellant would have been issued such a summons undermines the genuineness of the summons she did tender.\n[53] Furthermore, the RAD notes that the documentary evidence states that regardless of the form they take, public security summonses cannot last more than twelve hours, or twenty-four hours if the person is suspected of administrative violations punishable by detention.39 However, the Appellant has alleged that the PSB attended her home multiple times in an effort to arrest her. The RAD finds that the alleged actions of the PSB are inconsistent with the use a Public Security summons. The RAD notes that the documentary evidence states that coercive summons and arrest warrants are instruments that can be used by the PSB.40 The RAD finds it is reasonable to expect that given the allegations of the PSB's efforts to arrest the Appellant that the PSB would employ the use of these coercive instruments to carry out their intention rather than employ the use of an instrument that only allows short term detention and a minimal fine.\n[54] The RAD finds that the Appellant's allegations and testimony are inconsistent with the objective evidence in the record with regard to the provisions of the PSAPL. The RAD finds that the findings in respect to the summons undermine genuineness of the document and as such, the RAD affords little evidentiary weight to the summons and that there are sufficient grounds to confirm the finding that the document cannot be relied upon. The RAD concurs with the finding of the RPD in this instance and the Appellant's argument must fail.\n[55] In Addition the RAD finds when considering all of the evidence little weight can be given to the summons in establishing that the Appellant is being pursued by the PSB.\nAdditional Documents\n[56] The Appellants submit that the RPD failed to consider relevant, probative, reliable and timely evidence. The RPD did not consider all the corroborative evidence presented by the Appellants. They further argue that the RPD erred in stating that the prevalence of fraudulent documents in China was a ground for finding documents presented in this case were fraudulent. The RPD has a duty to consider documents independently of its previous credibility findings. The RAD finds the Appellants' argument has merit.\n[57] The RAD finds that it is provided with jurisprudence in Huruglica41 that would allow it to independently assess the Appellant's documents. As a result, the RAD will examine the documents and make a finding in relation to their authenticity.\nThe Dismissal Notices\n[58] The RAD has examined the notes the Notice of Dismissals from employment for the female Appellant42 and the male Appellant.43 It notes the documents are from the two different companies at which the Appellants allegedly worked. The documents contain a stamp, but they are unsigned by company officials. The RAD notes they are produced in very simple but similar formats that could be made by any individual with basic word processing tools.\n[59] The RAD further notes these documents contain basic company names, addresses and telephone numbers, but they do not contain identifying logos or letterhead that would define the specific company. The RAD additionally notes these two documents are very similar in form although two different companies have allegedly produced them. There is no notation on the face of the document to indicate this is a standard form that is issued for dismissal.\n[60] The RAD having reviewed and considered the documents finds they do not bear the hallmarks of a genuine document and assigns them little evidentiary weight as support for the Appellant's allegation of pursuit by the authorities in China.\nThe Notice for the Unit or a Family Member of the Arrested\n[61] The RAD has reviewed the Notice for the Unit or a Family Member of the Arrested.44 The RAD notes the document is simple in its design and format and could be produced by any individual with basic word processing tools. The RAD further notes this document contains no security features beyond a simple red ink stamp that would guard against forgery.\n[62] The RAD has considered that if this document was found to be genuine, it confirms the arrest of an individual in China, but it is does not provide persuasive support that the PSB in China are pursuing the Appellant. The RAD finds it can assign the Notice for the Unit or a Family Member of the Arrested little evidentiary weight as support that the PSB in China are pursuing the Appellant because of her practice of Falun Gong.\nFalun Gong Identity\n[63] The RPD found that the female Appellant was not a genuine Falun Gong practitioner since she did not understand and could not demonstrate a level of knowledge, given her alleged Falun Gong profile. The RPD found that the female Appellant had scant knowledge of two important concepts of Falun Gong philosophy concepts of \"righteous thoughts\" and \"attachments\" which are important basic concepts that should be known by Falun Gong practitioners.\n[64] The Appellants submit that the RPD only assessed her knowledge based on two concepts of Falun Gong. They further submit that the RPD held her to an unreasonably high threshold of knowledge in order to accept her identity as a Falun Gong practitioner. They further argue that the Appellant has limited experience with Falun Gong and that does not mean she is not a genuine practitioner. The RAD is not persuaded by the Appellants' argument in this regard.\n[65] The RAD is cognizant of Federal Court jurisprudence, including that cited by the Appellant, which cautions against determining religious identity on the basis of a refugee Appellant's religious knowledge, or lack thereof. However, the RAD believes it is important to recognize that, unlike religions in general, which are faith-based, the objective evidence establishes that knowledge is an important component of Falun Gong.\nThe foundation of Falun Dafa [Falun Gong] consists of a body of fundamental knowledge essential for the task of undertaking proper cultivation towards higher stages of attainment. It comprises Master Li's teachings collected in a number of books, the most important of which being Zhuan Falun (Revolving the Law Wheel); and China Falun Gong is a good summary of principle and exercise recommended for the beginners. Much of the teachings are highly classified knowledge that are hitherto imparted exclusively from master to trusted disciples since antiquity in China.45\n[66] The RAD notes the foundation of Falun Gong is a body of fundamental knowledge, essential for the task of undertaking proper cultivation. The RAD finds it would be difficult for a purported Falun Gong practitioner, who alleges as the Appellant in her testimony that she has read the principle text associated with Falun Gong, Zhuan Falun and has attended some group study sessions, to claim to have little of this fundamental knowledge.\n[67] The RAD finds it reasonable to believe that the RPD's expectations of someone like the Appellant, who claims to adhere to a knowledge-based practice, may well be different than the expectations of someone who claims to follow a faith-based belief system. While this does not justify a microscopic analysis of a claimant's evidence, the RAD finds it reasonable to expect that a person who alleges to be a Falun Gong practitioner would be able to demonstrate a level of fundamental knowledge commensurate with his or her experience in the practice.\n[68] The RAD notes that the Appellant does not dispute that knowledge of the concept of attachments is basic or fundamental to the practice of Falun Gong. Rather, the Appellant argues that the RPD did not ask the female Appellant to provide an in-depth explanation of \"attachments\", and she successfully provided examples of attachments when the Member asked her to do so. The RAD has reviewed the audio recording of the hearing as well as the transcript provided by the Appellants. The RAD notes the Appellant was asked to provide other examples of attachments. Her testimony described being eager to get serious illness cured and noted this was an attachment. The RAD finds the Appellant's testimony did not address the question put to her. The RAD agrees with the finding of the RPD that the female Appellant failed to explain the concept of attachments and to provide more examples. The RPD noted that the documentary evidence in Lecture Four of Zhuan Falun stated:\nThere are so many attachments to be relinquished, such as the mentality of showing off, jealousy, the competitive mentality and zealotry.... During the entire course of cultivation, we should lose all everyday people's attachments and various desires.\n[69] The Appellants also did not dispute the importance to Falun Gong of the concept of \"righteous thoughts\". The Appellants submit that Master Li acknowledged in the text \"At present, there are still some students who haven't really grasped the essentials of sending righteous thoughts.\" The Appellants argue that the Appellant began practicing Falun Gong in XXXX 2015 and joined group practice for the first time in XXXX 2015. She arrived in Canada in late September 2015, and for the first time, she had access to Falun Gong text and materials. It is argued that this brought her within the class of students mentioned by Master Li in his text. The Appellants state in their submissions that it was plausible that the female Appellant's knowledge of \"righteous thoughts\" may not have been advanced, but this did not indicate that she was not a genuine Falun Gong practitioner.\n[70] The RAD finds that the RPD did consider the Appellant's particular profile in coming to its conclusions. The RAD notes that the RPD took into consideration the amount of time that she had spent in Falun Gong and the opportunities that she had to study the text Zhuan Falun. The RAD agrees with the RPD's finding that the female Appellant ought to have knowledge of these basic and fundamental Falun Gong concepts.\n[71] After a review of the evidence in the record and the audio recording of the hearing, the RAD finds that the Appellant has not demonstrated the level of knowledge that might be expected given her alleged Falun Gong profile. The RAD notes that Master Li Hongzhi, the founder and Master of Falun Dafa, states that, without an understanding of the philosophy of Falun Gong (fundamental knowledge essential for the task of undertaking proper cultivation towards higher stages of attainment), the exercises are solely Qi Gong exercises.46 As such, knowledge of the philosophy gained through study is a key component of Falun Gong practice.\n[72] The RAD finds that the lack of knowledge of these fundamental and key concepts undermines the credibility of her allegations that she was a genuine practitioner in China. The RAD finds, on the basis of the forgoing analysis and on a balance of probabilities, that the female Appellant was not a genuine practitioner in China, as she has alleged, and that the Public Security Bureau (PSB) is not pursuing her.\n[73] The RAD finds on the basis of the totality of the adverse credibility findings that the Appellant's allegations that she is being pursued by the PSB in China because of her practice of Falun Gong is not credible.\nThe Falun Dafa Association\n[74] The RPD found that a genuine Falun Gong practitioner would have sought out the Falun Dafa Association of Canada (FDAC) in Toronto and the Appellant's failure to do so undermines her credibility and her identity as a practitioner. The Appellant submits that the RPD erred in substituting its own viewpoint in finding that she should have approached the FDAC. The RAD finds the Appellant's argument has some merit.\n[75] The RAD notes the documentary evidence47confirms it does support refugee claimants and will provide letters of support to genuine practitioners. While it was open to the RPD to reject the Appellant's explanation that she did not seek out the assistance of the FDAC because she did not know where it was located, the RAD finds that the RPD's finding that she should have sought out the assistance of the FDAC in Canada is flawed. The evidence suggests that the FDA only provides assistance to those practitioners with whom they are familiar. Furthermore, the RAD finds there is no evidence in the record, which supports the notion that genuine practitioners need to have an affiliation with the FDA.\n[76] The RAD concurs with the Appellant that the RPD's finding in this regard was speculative at best and it cannot be supported. The RAD has considered whether this finding is sufficient to justify setting aside the decision. Notwithstanding this error made by the RPD, the RAD finds after its review and assessment of all of the evidence in the record that the cumulative sustained adverse credibility findings of the RPD are sufficient to confirm the RPD's overall determination.\nThe sur place Claim\n[77] The RPD found there was insufficient evidence to find that the Appellant's participation in Falun Gong activities in public spaces in Canada was brought to the attention of Chinese authorities. The Appellant submits the RPD conducted an incomplete assessment of the sur place claim. The RAD is not persuaded by the argument of the Appellant.\n[78] The RAD finds that the RPD did consider the risk to the Appellant if the Chinese authorities became aware of her Falun Gong activities in Canada. The RAD has reviewed the credibility findings in this claim and finds that the credibility findings are significant and compelling. The RAD finds that, based on the these credibility findings, the Appellant has not provided credible and trustworthy evidence to establish her allegations of practicing Falun Gong in China, being wanted for such practice and now being a genuine practitioner of Falun Gong in Canada.\n[79] The RAD finds the RPD considered whether the Appellant's activities in Canada would place her at risk of persecution. The RAD finds that it was open to the RPD to find, on a balance of probabilities that the Appellant engaged in Falun Gong activities in Canada for the purpose of bolstering a fraudulent refugee claim.\n[80] The RAD also finds as noted by the RPD that there was no persuasive evidence adduced at the hearing or in her BOC form that the Appellant's practice of Falun Gong in Canada has come to the attention of Chinese authorities or that she would be perceived to be a genuine practitioner. In this respect, the RAD is guided by the Federal Court Trial Division decision in Wang,48 which held that a sur place claim could not be maintained in the absence of evidence that the making of the refugee claim had specifically come to the attention of the authorities of the claimant's country of origin. The Appellant does not submit that the RPD has misconstrued the facts in Wang.\n[81] The RAD finds that the credibility findings can be imported into its assessment of the Appellant's sur place claim.49 Having found the female Appellant's story of persecution by the PSB because of her Falun Gong activities not to be credible, there is no reason to believe that she is now a genuine Falun Gong practitioner. The Appellant has described Falun Gong activities in Canada and has provided some pictures and a letter from another Falun Gong participant, but they are not sufficient to overcome the other findings. The letter does not contain any details as to when the Appellant began to participate with the group or how often she attends. The RAD has reviewed the photographs and finds they do not attest to her motivation in joining Falun Gong activities in Canada or the genuineness of her convictions.\n[82] The RAD notes that the Appellant has alleged that her desire to initiate the practice of Falun Gong took place as a result of circumstances, which occurred in China. She alleges her continued practice of her alleged belief system in Canada is based on her adherence to her practice in China. Having found that she was not a Falun Gong practitioner in China and having no evidence of conversion in Canada, the RAD finds, on a balance of probabilities, and in the context of the findings noted above, that the Appellant joined a Falun Gong group in Canada only for the purpose of supporting a fraudulent refugee claim.\n[83] In the context as noted above and on the basis of the totality of evidence, the RAD finds that the Appellant is not a genuine adherent of Falun Gong, nor would she be perceived to be in China.\n[84] The male Appellant bases his claim for refugee protection on the claim of his wife as a Falun Gong practitioner. As a result of the findings in regard to his wife, there is no persuasive evidence that he will be persecuted or at risk to his life or at risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger of torture if he returns to China.\nFailure to Claim\n[85] The RPD made a negative credibility inference from the Appellants' failure to make a claim for refugee protection in the United States where they transited through two cities. The RPD further noted that the Appellants entered Canada without status and failed to make a refugee claim at their first opportunity at the Vancouver airport. The RPD found this action further undermines their credibility as persons needing the protection of a safe country. The Appellants' submit they were using the services of a smuggler and he made the decisions on their behalf. The RAD is not persuaded by the argument of the Appellants.\n[86] The RAD in its review of the audio recording of the hearing notes the RPD questioned the Appellant extensively about the journey including travel through South Korea, Hawaii and Seattle, as well as their reasons for not making a claim for protection in the various locations. The RAD notes the Appellant's testimony confirmed she was well aware of the ability to make a refugee claim in the US. She further confirmed having discussed with the smuggler the options available to her in the US as well as the actions associated in crossing the border into Canada illegally. The Appellant's explanation for not making a claim for refugee protection in the US was that the smuggler told her they would be detained in the US until their refugee hearing and it was much more likely to have a successful refugee claim in Canada.\n[87] The RAD has considered that the Appellant is a reasonably sophisticated individual. The RAD finds the Appellant's testimony indicates she is able to gather information and assess her situation. Her testimony indicated the smuggler provided her with information about making a refugee claim in the US. The RAD has also considered the Appellant's submission that they paid the smuggler for safe passage to Canada and they were acting on his instruction. The RAD has also considered that the Appellant's testimony has led to the identification of a number of credibility concerns. The RAD finds the Appellant's explanation is not credible.\n[88] The RAD further notes that delay points to a lack of subjective fear, the rationale being that someone who was truly fearful would claim refugee status at the first opportunity:\n[16] It is trite law, as the Board recognized, that in assessing a applicant's subjective fear of persecution, the Board can take into consideration the applicant's behaviour. The Federal Court of Appeal in Heer v. M.E.I. (13 April 1988) Doc. No. A-474-87 (F.C.A.) recognized that an applicant's delay in claiming refugee status \"is an important factor which the Board is entitled to consider in weighing a claim for refugee status\". As the Board states, delay points to a lack of subjective fear of persecution, the reasoning being that someone who was truly fearful would claim refugee status at the first opportunity.50\n[89] The RAD notes the Appellant was in the US, a democratic country with a similar asylum system to that in Canada. The Appellant possessed some form of legal status in the US. Further to this the Appellant made a choice to risk crossing the US\/Canada border illegally. The RAD notes that had the Appellant been apprehended on the US side of the border crossing she would risk deportation from the US, similar to her fear described in her testimony. The RAD finds the Appellant's conscious choice not to make an asylum claim in the US detracts from her subjective fear.\n[90] The RAD notes the words of the Federal Court in Ibnmogdad v. Canada\nFinally, it was reasonable for the tribunal to draw a negative inference from the fact that the applicant had travelled through Germany, Portugal and Ireland, yet waited to claim refugee status in Canada. The recent decision of Remedios v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2003] F.C.J. No. 617 (Q.L.), reaffirms the principle that it is not unreasonable to conclude that the failure of an applicant to claim refugee status in countries that are signatories to the Geneva Convention amounts to country shopping.51\nThe RAD has considered the Appellant's testimony and finds her behaviour displays that of an asylum shopper.\n[91] The RAD has reviewed the record and finds there is a basis to make a negative inference in respect of the Appellant's failure to make a refugee claim at the first opportunity. The RAD concurs with the finding of the RPD and the Appellant's argument must fail.\nThe US Visa\n[92] The RPD found all U.S. visa recipients undergo security checks. The Appellants argue that the IRB erred in failing to put the this issue to the Appellants at the hearing and failing to provide background detail as to the nature or content of the security check undertaken by US authorities in its decision. The RAD finds the Appellants' submission has merit.\n[93] The RAD has reviewed the record as well as the documentary evidence52 cited by the RPD and notes that the RPD did not put its concern about security checks to the Appellants. The RAD further finds that neither the documentary evidence nor the statements of the RPD clearly define the nature and extent of the security checks conducted. The RAD finds the RPD has erred by failing to put its concerns to the Appellants and by speculating that the documentary evidence confirms that US authorities have access to a Chinese criminal database.\n[94] The RAD finds that the RPD finding is not sustainable. The RAD has considered whether this finding is sufficient to justify setting aside the decision. Notwithstanding this error made by the RPD, the RAD finds after its review and assessment of all of the evidence in the record that the cumulative sustained adverse credibility findings of the RPD are sufficient to confirm the RPD's overall determination.\nIn Summary\n[95] The RAD agrees with the RPD and finds that, in light of the cumulative adverse credibility findings, the Appellants are not credible and that overall their allegations lack veracity. When considering the facts and evidence of this case in totality, the RAD finds that there is not a serious possibility of persecution for the Appellants, nor would they be subjected personally, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to life, a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture, should they return to China. Accordingly, the Appellants are neither a Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\nCONCLUSION\n[96] Pursuant to section 111(1)(a) of the IRPA, the RAD confirms the decision of the RPD and dismisses the appeals.\n(signed)\n\"Robert Bebbington\"\nRobert Bebbington\nMarch 22, 2017\nDate\n37Exhibit RPD-1, RPD's Record, Exhibit 3, NDP for China (October 30, 2015), Item 9.14\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD.25.02 (June 23, 2014)\nRAD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SAR :\nTB6-02213\nTB6-02214\n",

I am not able to set aside the RPD's determination and substitute the determination that should have been made without hearing evidence that was presented to the RPD.\n[4] Pursuant to subsection 111(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), the RAD refers the matter to the RPD for re-determination by a differently constituted panel.\nBACKGROUND\n[5] The appellant is a 76-year-old man who alleged before the RPD that he was harassed by the police in his country after his son XXXX XXXX left for Canada in 2004. XXXX XXXX was a XXXX who fled his country and obtained refugee protection in Canada.\n[6] The appellant alleged that he and his wife left the city of Mahajanga, where they were living, in 2005, for a village located in the remote and isolated region of XXXX, where they had no access to social services or medical care.\n[7] The appellant alleged that, in 2013, his son took steps to bring him and his wife to Canada. A visa application was filed for this purpose. However, the appellant's wife died suddenly of heart problems on XXXX XXXX, 2013.\n[8] The appellant left his country on XXXX XXXX, 2013, for Canada, where he claimed refugee protection. He alleged that he fears returning to his country, where he would have to continue living in an isolated village and in fear of being arrested by the police, who are allegedly still looking for his son.\n[9] The RPD rejected the claim for refugee protection on the ground that the evidence submitted, both testimonial and documentary, did not demonstrate that the appellant's profile matched that of a person of interest to Malagasy authorities.\n[10] In particular, the RPD considered the appellant's testimony that he and his wife lived without any specific concerns since their relocation to a remote region in 2005; that his two other sons were not bothered by the Malagasy authorities; that he was issued a passport in December 2009 and was able to leave his country without a problem; and that the documentary evidence submitted did not demonstrate that a wanted person's family members are bothered by the authorities. Furthermore, the RPD granted no probative value to a document submitted by the appellant after the hearing, which is an alleged police summons sent to the appellant in February 2014.\n[11] Before the RAD, the appellant submits that the RPD erred in its assessment of the evidence submitted, in particular with respect to the circumstances surrounding his wife's death, the documentary evidence on people of interest to Malagasy authorities and the issuance of his passport. In this regard, he submitted a document taken from the website of the embassy of Madagascar in Canada, namely, a passport application form establishing, according to him, that immigration authorities, and not the police, issue passports. In addition, the appellant submits that the RPD breached the rules of natural justice and procedural fairness by failing to confront him about the summons submitted after the hearing and by failing to grant it any probative value.\n[12] It is for this last reason that I set aside the RPD's determination and refer the matter to it.\n[13] For these reasons, the appellant is requesting that the RAD allow the appeal.\nADMISSIBILITY OF NEW EVIDENCE\n[14] As mentioned above, the appellant submitted new evidence in his record before the RAD: the Renewal of Biometric Passport Application Form, taken from the website of the embassy of Madagascar in Canada (see pages 13 and 14 of the appellant's record).\n[15] In his memorandum, the appellant indicates that this document was available before the RPD hearing, but that he could not have anticipated that the [translation] \"RPD would raise a contradiction with the claimant's testimony at the time of the hearing.\"\n[16] As I am referring the matter to the RPD for re-determination on the ground that it breached a rule of natural justice and procedural fairness, it will not be necessary to accept this document as evidence before the RAD, since this document relates to the issue of the appellant's credibility. The appellant will have the opportunity to submit it as evidence before the RPD if he considers it necessary.\nDECISION ON WHETHER TO HOLD A HEARING BEFORE THE RAD\n[17] Under subsection 110(6) of the IRPA, the RAD may hold a hearing if, in its opinion, the new evidence presented on appeal is admissible and meets the following three criteria: 1) it raises a serious issue with respect to the person's credibility; 2) it is central to the decision with respect to the refugee protection claim; and 3) if accepted, it would justify allowing or rejecting the refugee protection claim.\n[18] Given that the preliminary requirement to this provision was not met, since no new evidence was accepted in this appeal, I conclude that no hearing can be held in this case.\nTHE RAD'S ROLE\n[19] The IRPA does not expressly set out the standard of review or intervention that the RAD should apply when reviewing RPD decisions. In this case, the appellant does not specifically submit what this standard of review should be, although he repeatedly states in his memorandum that the RPD's decision is not [translation] \"reasonable.\"\n[20] The Federal Court, which has the authority to review RAD decisions, has rendered a few decisions to date regarding the standard of review or intervention that the RAD should apply and its role when RPD decisions are appealed to it.\n[21] In Alvarez1 and Eng,2 both rendered on July 17, 2014, the Honourable Justice Shore of the Federal Court of Canada has ruled on this matter.\n[22] At paragraphs 28 and 29 of Alvarez and paragraphs 29 and 30 of Eng, the Court writes as follows:\n[28] Parliament conferred a true appellate function on the RAD, a specialized (if not overspecialized) tribunal, which sits on appeal of the decisions of another administrative tribunal. Contrary to a court exercising a superintending and reforming power over public bodies, the RAD's primary responsibility is to ensure the integrity and consistency of proceedings before the RPD and to reduce needless duplication of proceedings (including before the Federal Court). When analyzing a decision of the RPD, the RAD must not merely determine whether it was made in a reasonable manner, but, rather, analyze whether the RPD relied on a wrong principle of law or misassessed the facts to the point of making a palpable and overriding error (Housen, above).\n[29] \"Palpable and overriding error\" is often used interchangeably with the \"clearly wrong\" or \"unreasonable\" decision test. However, this is the appellate-level standard of intervention that a specialized appeal tribunal such as the RAD must apply when reviewing a decision and not the judicial review standard of reasonableness. Even though there are similarities, these standards are different.\n[23] The Court adds the following at paragraph 33 of Alvarez and paragraph 34 of Eng:\n[33] The Court agrees that the RPD, as the tribunal of first instance, is owed a measure of deference with regard to its findings of fact, and of fact and law. The RPD is better situated to draw such conclusion as it is the tribunal of first instance, the trier of facts, having the advantage of hearing testimony viva voce (Housen, above). However, the RAD must nonetheless perform its own assessment of all of the evidence in order to determine whether the RPD relied on a wrong principle of law or misassessed the facts to the point of making a palpable and overriding error. The idea that the RAD may substitute an original decision by a determination that should have been rendered without first assessing the evidence is completely inconsistent with the purpose of the IRPA and the case law dealing with the virtually identical wording of subsection 67(2). The Court finds that the RAD misinterpreted its role as an appeal body in holding that its role was merely to assess, against a standard of reasonableness, whether the RPD's decision is within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes.\n[24] In Huruglica,3 rendered on August 22, 2014, the Honourable Justice Phelan of the Federal Court examines the role and functions of the RAD and writes as follows:\n[44] Subject to specific language, the need for deference, for example, is less compelling between the RAD and the RPD than it is between the judiciary and the executive. The relationship is more akin to that between a trial court and an appellate court but further influenced by the much greater remedial powers given to the appellate tribunal.\n[45] Therefore, a standard of review analysis is not an appropriate analytical approach....\n[25] With regard to the RAD's authority under subsection 111(1) of the IRPA to substitute the determination that, \"in its opinion, should have been made,\" Justice Phelan writes:\n[47] Unlike judicial review, the RAD, pursuant to subsection 111(1)(b), may substitute the determination which \"in its opinion, should have been made\". One precondition of exercising this power is that the RAD must conduct an independent assessment of the application in order to arrive at its own opinion. It is not necessary, in order to trigger this remedial power, that the RAD must find error on some standard of review basis.\n[48] The restriction on the ability to receive fresh evidence is not a bar to conducting a de novo appeal....\n[26] Justice Phelan concludes that:\n[54] Having concluded that the RAD erred in reviewing the RPD's decision on the standard of reasonableness, I have further concluded that for the reasons above, the RAD is required to conduct a hybrid appeal. It must review all aspects of the RPD's decision and come to an independent assessment of whether the claimant is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. Where its assessment departs from that of the RPD, the RAD must substitute its own decision.\n[55] In conducting its assessment, it can recognize and respect the conclusion of the RPD on such issues as credibility and\/or where the RPD enjoys a particular advantage in reaching such a conclusion but it is not restricted, as an appellate court is, to intervening on facts only where there is a \"palpable and overriding error\".\n[27] In Spasoja,4 rendered on September 23, 2014, the Honourable Justice Roy of the Federal Court also examines the RAD's role.\n[28] In that case, in line with the previous Huruglica, Eng and Alvarez decisions, the Court first finds that the RAD erred in applying the standard of reasonableness rather than conducting an independent assessment of the refugee protection claim (paragraph 12).\n[29] The Honourable Justice Roy proceeds with a detailed analysis of the statutory provisions relating to the RAD under the IRPA; of the case law pertaining to the role of an appellate body within an administrative tribunal, particularly Parizeau (Parizeau v. Barreau du Qu\u00e9bec, 2011 RJQ 1506); and of Parliament's intent as stated by various stakeholders in debates about the RAD before the parliamentary committee of the House of Commons, to determine that the appeal referred to in sections 110 and 111 of the IRPA cannot be equated to a judicial review, but to an appeal in its own right (paragraph 39).\n[30] Relying on the conclusions in Parizeau in terms of the standard of review that an appellate tribunal must apply, and distinguishing himself somewhat from his colleague who rendered the Court's decision in Huruglica, the Honourable Justice Roy concludes that the standards of review applicable to the RAD are correctness for questions of law, and palpable and overriding error for questions of fact and questions of mixed fact and law. In addition, the RAD must give deference to the RPD's findings on the credibility given to the witnesses heard before it (paragraphs 39, 40 and 46).\n[31] The Honourable Justice Roy also states that he cannot find any indication that could lead to the conclusion that the proceedings before the RAD are de novo proceedings (paragraph 42), and writes in the following paragraph of his decision that:\n[translation]\n[43] The system under review refers instead to appeals on determined questions, be they of fact, of law, or of mixed law and fact (subs. 110(1)). In my view, this means that the appellant must identify the questions to be addressed in the appeal. The appeal will be heard based on the record before the RPD, on the basis of the questions identified and raised, subject to documentary evidence (subs. 110(3)) or evidence in keeping with subsection 110(4)....\n[32] Lastly, in a decision rendered on October 8, 2014 (Alyafi v. M.C.I., 2014 FC 952), the Honourable Justice Martineau of the Federal Court, having considered the above cases, first finds that all of them reject the reasonableness standard of review, and then expresses his opinion that the RAD must be allowed to choose between the two remaining options: the one set out in Eng, Alvarez and Spasoja, which is the standard of palpable and overriding error, and the one set out in Huruglica, which he describes as \"a composite and variable standard of review resulting from the nature of the claim before the RAD-characterized as a hybrid appeal-and the particular nature of questions of fact, or of mixed fact and law, raised by an appellant\" (paragraph 16).\n[33] Justice Martineau writes in paragraph 46 of Alyafi that:\n[34] ...I chose the middle path, that of wisdom: allow the RAD to apply the second or third approach as long as the scope of the appellate review of the RPD's decisions has not been settled by a final judgment by the Federal Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court of Canada. Quite simply.\n[35] Consequently, I am of the opinion that it is preferable for the RAD to apply the principles established in Spasoja because, with respect, the RAD's role as described therein appears to me to be more easily applicable than as described in Huruglica.\n[36] In this case, I am of the opinion that the error alleged by the appellant to the effect that the RPD breached the rules of natural justice and procedural fairness is a question of law, and is subject to the correctness standard of review.\n[37] In Sketchley,5 the Federal Court of Appeal writes in paragraph 53 that:\n[53] CUPE directs a court, when reviewing a decision challenged on the grounds of procedural fairness, to isolate any act or omission relevant to procedural fairness (at paragraph 100). This procedural fairness element is reviewed as a question of law. No deference is due. The decision maker has either complied with the content of the duty of fairness appropriate for the particular circumstances, or has breached this duty.\n[38] It will not be necessary for me to further consider the error raised by the appellant regarding the RPD's assessment of the evidence before it.\nANALYSIS\n[39] The issue in this case is therefore whether the RPD breached the rules of natural justice and procedural fairness.\n[40] I am of the opinion that the answer to this question is yes, for the following reasons.\n[41] In its reasons, the RPD considers the document submitted by the appellant after the hearing, that is, document 6, an alleged police summons sent to the appellant's Madagascar home on or around XXXX XXXX, 2014 (see pages 99 to 102 of the RPD record). The appellant did not have this document at the time of the RPD hearing, and it was agreed that he could submit it as evidence after the hearing.\n[42] The RPD did not grant any probative value to this document for a number of reasons, in particular because the appellant did not explain how his counsel or his son in Madagascar allegedly obtained it, because some of the writing on it is of poor quality, because it states that the appellant received other summonses of this kind, and because it does not indicate why the appellant is allegedly being summoned.\n[43] In his memorandum, the appellant submits that the RPD erred in failing to confront him and in failing to ask him to explain these issues it raised in its reasons, thus breaching the rules of natural justice and procedural fairness.\n[44] I agree with the appellant in this respect.\n[45] Although the appellant mentioned this document at the hearing, he did not have it in his possession at the time, and I am of the opinion that it was impossible for him at that time to answer any questions that the RPD might have had once it had the document before it. And the RPD's reasons show that it did have a number of questions, which were certainly legitimate, once it received this document. The fact remains that the RPD had a duty to confront the appellant about these questions and to consider his explanations before analyzing the probative value of this document.\n[46] In addition, it appears to me that this document, if genuine, could constitute evidence that goes directly against the RPD's key finding that the evidence presented does not demonstrate that the Malagasy authorities would have an interest in the appellant.\n[47] For these reasons, I am of the opinion that the RPD decision is flawed and that the matter must be referred to it for re-determination.\n[48] Consequently, it is not necessary to further assess the question of whether the RPD erred in its assessment of the evidence before it and with respect to its finding that the evidence did not demonstrate that the Malagasy authorities would have an interest in the appellant.\nREMEDY\n[49] I determine that the RPD decision is wrong in mixed fact and law. I am not able to set aside the RPD's determination and substitute the determination that should have been made without hearing evidence that was presented to the RPD.\n[50] Pursuant to subsection 111(1) of the IRPA, the RAD refers the matter to the RPD for re-determination by a differently constituted panel.\n[51] The appeal is allowed.\nNormand Leduc\nNormand Leduc\nOctober 16, 2014\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nN\u00b0 de dossier de la SAR \/ RAD File No.:MB4-01848\nRAD.25.02 (June 23, 2014)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\nRAD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SAR : MB4-01848\n10\n",

The Appellant's youngest son, XXXX XXXX (American Minor Appellant), is a citizen of the United States of America (USA). The Appellants allege persecution in South Africa due to the Appellant's interracial marriage, the Appellant's conversion to Islam and the children's biracial status. The American Associate Appellant alleges persecution due to having to return to the USA on his own.\n[3] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) found that that Appellants had not credibly established their claims and that the Appellants do not have a personal profile that would put them at risk in South Africa. The RPD further found that the American Associate Appellant has not established that he faces a risk in the USA.\n[4] The Appellants argue that the RPD Member was biased against the Appellants as the same RPD Member heard and rejected the Appellant's husband's claim. The Appellants further argue that the Member erred when assessing the credibility of both the Appellant's testimony and their supporting documents. The Appellants argue that the American Minor Appellant's age was not considered when assessing his risk in the USA. The Appellants argue that the Member failed to consider that the Appellant converted to Islam, and that the Appellants have experienced a personalized risk, rather than a generalized risk, in South Africa.\n[5] I find that the new evidence disputes the credibility findings made by the RPD. I find that the determinative issues in this case are state protection and the Appellants' residual profile.\nDECISION\n[6] The appeal is allowed. I send this matter back to the RPD to be redetermined.\nNEW EVIDENCE\nThe evidence presented by the Appellants is accepted\n[7] According to the law,1 I can only accept evidence that:\ni. arose after the RPD decision; or\nii. was not reasonably available at the time of the decision; or\niii. that you could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to bring to the RPD before the decision.\n[8] If the evidence meets one or more of these requirements, I must decide if the evidence is new, credible and relevant before I can accept it.2\n[9] The Appellants have submitted the following documents:\n- A letter from the Appellant's accountant dated XXXX XXXX, 2020.\n- A letter from the South Africa Revenue Service dated XXXX XXXX, 2020.\n- An email from XXXX XXXX dated XXXX XXXX, 2020 with attached letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX dated XXXX XXXX, 2020.\nThe letter from the Appellant's accountant is new, credible, and relevant\n[10] I find that this letter is able to contradict a credibility finding made by the RPD, and therefore I will admit this letter into evidence.\n[11] The Appellant alleges that she thought to ask her accountant for a letter to confirm the location of her businesses in XXXX of 2020. The Appellant obtained this letter to respond to\nthe RPD's finding that the Appellants did not move to XXXX. On a balance of probabilities, I find that it is reasonable that the Appellants would not have thought to provide this letter until they read the RPD's reasons for denying their claim.\n[12] The letter is on letterhead and it provides the contact information and practitioner code for the author. I find that the letter is able to confirm that the Appellant had a business in Potchefstroom and is therefore able to contradict the RPD's finding that the Appellants did not move there. For these reasons, I find that this letter is new, credible, and relevant and I will admit it into evidence.\nThe letter from the South Africa Revenue Service is new, credible, and relevant\n[13] The Appellant received this letter via email on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2020. The letter is on letterhead and bears a Quick Response (QR) code on the bottom. This letter confirms the tax reference number listed in the accountant's letter. As this letter is corroborative evidence that the accountant's letter is credible, and because I have found the accountant's letter to be capable of contradicting a finding made by the RPD, I will admit this letter into evidence.\nThe letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX is new, credible, and relevant\n[14] The Appellants obtained this letter to respond to the RPD's findings regarding another letter from this hospital. For this reason, I find that this letter is capable of contradicting a finding made by the RPD and I will admit this letter into evidence.\nA hearing is not warranted\n[15] As I am returning this matter for redetermination, I will not hold a hearing under subsection 110(6) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).3\nANALYSIS\n[16] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.4\n[17] When assessing this case, I took into consideration the Chairperson's Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution (Gender Guideline).5\nThere is no evidence that the RPD Member was biased\n[18] There is no rule that the same RPD Member cannot hear the claims of two family members who have asked for their claims to be split. The RPD's credibility findings were all based on the information in the record. Further, the Appellants raised this issue at the RPD hearing, but chose not to make an application for the Member to recuse themselves.\n[19] The Appellants argue that a reasonable person, who is reasonably informed of the facts of this case, would think it more likely than not that the RPD Member was biased. The RPD Member heard and rejected the Appellant's husband's case before making a decision on this matter. The Appellants allege that the reason they asked for their claim to be severed from the Appellant's husband's claim was because they expected the Appellant and her husband to present conflicting testimony due to the numerous conflicts between them. The Appellants allege that it is very unlikely that the RPD Member would be able to completely separate in her mind the two claims, and that the Member is likely to have an unconscious bias towards the Appellant's testimony.\n[20] At the RPD hearing, the Appellant's Counsel raised this issue. The RPD Member discussed the issue with Counsel but noted that there was no application for recusal. Counsel stated that there was no sufficient basis to bring such an application, and they were comfortable to proceed.6\n[21] I have reviewed the RPD decision and the entire record. I found no instances where the RPD made a decision without reference to the record. The Appellants have not pointed to any examples of bias for me to address. The mere fact that the RPD heard claims from two family members who has asked for their claims to be split is not sufficient evidence of bias. For these reasons, I find that there is no evidence that the RPD Member was biased when deciding this claim.\nThe American Minor Appellant\n[22] While I find that the RPD was correct when finding that the American Minor Appellant did not meet the criteria to be found to be a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection, based on the claim that the American Minor Appellant would be separated from his family, I find that the Appellants have raised a new issue of the American Minor Appellant's extremely young age. The Appellant and her husband are unable to return to the USA as they are failed refugee claimants in that country. The American Minor Appellant would therefore be returning to the USA without either parent.\n[23] Given that I am returning this matter for reasons that relate to whether the American Minor Appellant could safely live in South Africa, specifically his biracial status, I will return his claim along with his mother's and brother's claims, so that the RPD can address the claim against the USA regarding his extremely young age.\nCredibility\n[24] The Appellants have submitted new evidence which disputes the two main credibility findings made by the RPD. While I do not find that the RPD erred when making these findings, I do find that had the RPD had the benefit of reviewing these new documents, on a balance of probabilities, the RPD might have come to a different conclusion regarding these credibility findings.\nRelocation\n[25] The letter from the Appellant's accountant, along with the supporting letter from the South Africa Revenue Service, establish that the Appellant had two businesses in XXXX and one in XXXX. Given that the Appellant had businesses in these locations I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant has lived in both locations.\n[26] The RPD found that the Appellant had not credibly established that she relocated to XXXX. This finding was due to an omission in the listed addresses on the Appellant's Schedule A form, due to an omission in the Appellant's Basis of Claim (BOC) narrative regarding her return to XXXX, due to her inconsistency in the spelling of XXXX, and due to an incorrect and inconsistent spelling of XXXX in a supporting letter from a neighbour. The RPD took a negative credibility inference from these findings.\n[27] When reassessing this case, I direct the RPD to reweigh the evidence and determine whether there is sufficient evidence to establish that the Appellants relocated to flee from the agent of harm.\nDates of alleged incidents\n[28] The letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX responds to the concerns that the RPD has regarding the spelling error in another letter from this hospital. The RPD found that letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX was not credible due to the incorrect spelling of the city Johannesburg. On a balance of probabilities, I find that the new letter from this hospital credibly explains the spelling error. I direct the RPD to reweigh the evidence to determine whether the Appellants have established the dates of the alleged incidents.\nResidual profile\n[29] The RPD assessed the profile of the Appellants as Muslims and as children of foreigners in South Africa. I have reviewed this assessment and found no errors.\n[30] There are two aspects of the Appellants' profiles that were not addressed. The Appellant is a convert to Islam and the children are biracial. These aspects were discussed during the hearing, but they have not been addressed in the RPD decision. I direct the RPD to review these aspects of the Appellants' residual profile.\nState protection\n[31] As the RPD found that the Appellants had not credibly established their claims, state protection was not addressed. During redetermination, should the RPD find that the Appellants have credibly established their claims, I find that state protection would be the determinative issue, and I direct the RPD to assess whether the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\nCONCLUSION\n[32] The appeal is allowed. I send this matter back to the RPD to be redetermined.\nDIRECTIONS TO THE RPD\n[33] Assess the credibility of the Appellants' claims in light of the new evidence.\n[34] Assess the American Minor Appellant's new claim against the USA regarding his age.\n[35] Assess the Appellants' residual profiles.\n[36] Assess whether the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\n(signed)\nAnna Wyse\nAnna Wyse\nFebruary 17, 2021\nDate\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD File \/ Dossier de la SAR : TC0-06753\nTC0-06754 \/ TC0-06755\nRAD.25.02 (January, 2020)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n2\nImmigration and Refugee\nBoard of Canada\nRefugee Appeal Division\nCommission de l'immigration\net du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 du Canada\nSection d'appel des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s\nRAD.25.02 (January, 2020)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] XXXX XXXX (the Appellant) is a citizen of China. His claim for refugee protection, based on his practice of Falun Gong, was dismissed by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD). The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in assessing his claim and asks the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) to allow his appeal and determine that he is a Convention refugee.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nBACKGROUND\n[3] The Appellant alleged before the RPD that he had a gambling problem and was introduced to Falun Gong by a friend in April 2012. The Appellant began to practice with a group in the middle of April 2012. The group was raided by the Public Security Bureau (PSB) on November 24, 2012. The Appellant was not there as he was attending a friend's wedding. The Appellant received a phone call from his mother that day who told him that the police were looking for him because of his practice of Falun Gong and that all of the other practitioners had been arrested at the practice site. They wanted the Appellant to turn himself in at the police station. The Appellant went into hiding at his uncle's home. He learned from his parents that the police continued to look for him and that the other practitioners were still detained.\n[4] The Appellant contacted a smuggler who helped him leave China on XXXX XXXX, 2013.\n[5] The Appellant's claim for refugee protection was first heard by the RPD in 2013 and was rejected. The appeal of that decision to the RAD was allowed, and the claim was returned to the RPD to be re-heard by a differently constituted panel.\n[6] The claim was heard by the RPD a second time on April 17, 2018. In a decision dated May 9, 2018, the RPD rejected the claim finding that the Appellant was not a genuine practitioner of Falun Gong and that the PSB are not interested in him. This is the decision that is under review.\n[7] On appeal, the Appellant argues that the RPD erred in its credibility assessment; by finding that he is not a genuine practitioner of Falun Gong; and in its analysis of the sur place aspect of the claim.\nANALYSIS\nFalun Gong Knowledge\n[8] The RPD found that the Appellant lacked knowledge of key concepts of Falun Gong philosophy, which was inconsistent with his allegation that he had been practicing and studying Falun Gong for over six years. The RPD considered that Falun Gong is a knowledge-based cultivation practice and found that this lack of knowledge negatively impacted the Appellant's credibility.\n[9] The RPD found that the Appellant was aware of the concept of attachments but was unable to identify jealousy as the worst attachment as identified by Master Li in his book Zhuan Falun. The RPD considered that the Appellant had been studying that book on a regular basis for five years and drew a negative credibility finding.\n[10] The RPD drew a further negative credibility finding from the Appellant's lack of knowledge of the concept of righteous thoughts. The RPD noted that righteous thoughts is a major tenet of Falun Gong and the Appellant provided testimony about righteous thoughts that was inconsistent with the country conditions documentary evidence. The RPD found it was reasonable to expect the Appellant to know about this key concept given that he had alleged ongoing and dedicated practice for six years and had studied the book Zhuan Falun.\n[11] The RPD found that the Appellant's testimony about the principle of truthfulness was not consistent with the teachings of Master Li and drew a negative credibility finding. The RPD found that Master Li's teachings about truth in the first talk of his book Zhuan Falun were far deeper, broader and more profound than alleged by the Appellant.\n[12] The Appellant argues that the RPD held him to an unrealistically high standard of knowledge that was far beyond his ability and level of sophistication. He submits that he is not a scholar and that he demonstrated a sufficient level of knowledge and understanding of Falun Gong to establish on a balance of probabilities that he is a genuine practitioner. He submits that he provided credible responses about specific philosophies of Falun Gong and that the RPD expected him to respond to difficult follow-up questions regarding his understanding.\n[13] I have reviewed the record and have listened to the recording of the hearing. I find that the RPD did not err in making negative credibility findings regarding the Appellant's lack of knowledge of key concepts of Falun Gong. I have considered that the Appellant had been practicing Falun Gong for approximately six years at the time of his RPD hearing. He testified that he was introduced to Falun Gong in April 2012 and had been consistently practicing the exercises and studying the philosophy since that time. He stated that he has owned the book Zhuan Falun since arriving in Canada (therefore, for approximately five years at the time of the hearing) and reads it for 1 to 2 hours every 4 to 5 days. While in China, he shared a copy of the book with a few other practitioners. He attends a Falun Gong study group in Canada every week on Saturdays for two hours and attends group practice of the exercises once per week. The Appellant has 12 years of formal education and there is no evidence in the record that he suffers from memory, cognitive or emotional problems that would lead to an inability to remember or understand key concepts.\n[14] I have considered, as well, the nature of the practice of Falun Gong. I have considered the assessment of knowledge in faith-based refugee claims and note the Federal Court's decision by Justice Mandamin:\n[10] This Court has had several opportunities to address the very issue at stake here. In Dong v Canada (Minister of Citizenship & Immigration), 2010 FC 55 at para 20, Justice Kelen held:\nIn assessing a claimant's knowledge of Christianity, the Board should not adopt an unrealistically high standard of knowledge or focus on a \"few points of error or misunderstandings to a level which reached the microscopic analysis\" ... .1\n[15] I find it is also necessary to consider the nature of the religion or practice. Notably, the objective evidence in the National Documentation Package (NDP) establishes that knowledge is an important component of Falun Gong (also referred to as Falun Dafa):\nThe foundation of Falun Dafa consists of a body of fundamental knowledge essential for the task of undertaking proper cultivation towards higher stages of attainment. It comprises Master Li's teachings collected in a number of books, the most important of which being Zhuan Falun (Revolving the Law Wheel); and China Falun Gong is a good summary of principle and exercise recommended for the beginners. Much of the teachings are highly classified knowledge that are hitherto imparted exclusively from master to trusted disciples since antiquity in China.2\n[16] I note that Master Li Hongzhi, the founder and Master of Falun Dafa, states that, without an understanding of the philosophy of Falun Gong (fundamental knowledge essential for the task of undertaking proper cultivation towards higher stages of attainment), the exercises are solely Qi Gong exercises.3 As such, knowledge of the philosophy gained through study is a key component of Falun Gong practice.\n[17] Given that the foundation of Falun Gong is a body of fundamental knowledge, essential for the task of undertaking proper cultivation and that the Appellant had allegedly been practicing and studying Falun Gong since 2012, for approximately six years at the time of the hearing, I agree with the RPD that it is not reasonable that the Appellant would not be more aware of the philosophy and principles. The RAD finds that the expectations of someone like the Appellant, who claims to adhere to a knowledge-based practice, may well be different than the expectations of someone who claims to follow a faith-based belief system. While this does not justify a microscopic analysis of an appellant's evidence, it does create the expectation that a refugee claimant who purports to be a Falun Gong practitioner should be able to testify to that essential fundamental knowledge in a manner commensurate with his profile. The RAD notes that the Appellant was asked questions about basic philosophy and principles of Falun Gong at the hearing, which it finds to be commensurate with the knowledge of an individual who has been practicing for approximately six years and has had exposure to other practitioners during that period. I find that the Appellant's level of knowledge was insufficient to assist in establishing his identity as a genuine Falun Gong practitioner.\n[18] I agree with the RPD that the Appellant's limited knowledge of the basic Falun Gong concepts of attachments, truth and righteous thoughts, as explained by Master Li, is inconsistent with his allegations regarding his study of Falun Gong philosophy over a period of six years.\n[19] Master Li explicitly instructed practitioners in the book Zhuan Falun4 to get rid of their attachment of jealousy and to stop turning a blind eye to their problem. He wrote that the goal is to cultivate up to higher levels, so \"you have to get rid of jealousy. That's why I have singled it out.\"5 However, when asked at the hearing about which attachment the Master singled out as particularly bad, the Appellant noted attachments such as drugs, gambling, and domestic violence, but made no mention of jealousy. I find that expecting the Appellant to be aware of the Master's instructions regarding the attachment of jealousy is not an unrealistically high standard of knowledge far beyond his ability and level of sophistication, given his background and particular circumstances. I find that it is not necessary to be a scholar, as he argues, to be aware of this concept and instruction from Master Li.\n[20] I find, similarly, that the expectation that the Appellant would be able to expand upon the concept of truth, as explained by the Master, is reasonable. When asked at the hearing about the principle of truth he replied that it is to be a true person, do true things, good things and be a nice person. He was asked if he had anything else to say about truth and he replied in the negative. The Master wrote about truth (zhen) in his book Zhuan Falun,6 which the Appellant had been reading for six years at the time of the hearing. In addition to writing that one should tell the truth, do things truthfully, be a truthful person, the Master also spoke of returning to the original, true self, and that the cultivation of truth can generate great benevolent compassion and develop an aspiration to offer salvation to all beings. I find that the Appellant's response at the hearing when asked about truth was not commensurate with his alleged experience and background.\n[21] I further agree with the RPD that the Appellant's knowledge of the concept of sending out righteous thoughts was inconsistent with what is written in the country conditions documentary evidence. I find it suspect that he would not have an accurate understanding and knowledge of righteous thoughts given his commitment to the practice of Falun Gong, which included the study of the philosophy, performing the exercises and attending events. When asked about righteous thoughts at the hearing he stated that they are righteous thoughts of humans and that righteous thoughts are sent when they practiced the exercises and the magnetic field would send the righteous thoughts. He stated that the purpose of sending righteous thoughts was to \"communicate the universe and was beneficial for things around\".7 According to the country conditions documentary evidence, Master Li has asked practitioners to put their righteous thoughts to full use in order to reduce the evil beings' persecution of Dafa, Dafa disciples, and people of the world.8 He has provided specific instructions on how to send righteous thoughts, which include when to send out the thoughts, what words should be said and specific hand positions to be used.9 I note that information from the Falun Dafa Association of Canada (FDAC) indicates that the mandate of that group is to help create a good cultivation environment for practitioners and to help practitioners work towards ending the illegal persecution of Falun Gong in China by raising awareness.10 I note that the persecution of practitioners in China is a significant issue within the Falun Gong community. I find that the Appellant's failure to understand the concept of, or procedures for sending out, righteous thoughts as instructed by the Master is inconsistent with the level of experience and commitment to the practice he has alleged. I find that the RPD did not err by taking a negative credibility inference in this regard.\nFalun Dafa Association (FDA) Letter\n[22] The RPD found that the post hearing letter submitted by the Appellant from the FDA was inconsistent with his testimony that he had asked that organization six months before the hearing to provide a support letter and they had agreed to send it before the hearing. As the Appellant testified that he never received the letter, the RPD agreed to allow additional time for the letter to arrive and be submitted post hearing. The post hearing disclosure that was submitted included a copy of a letter from the Appellant's counsel to Mr. XXXX XXXX of the FDA (Toronto) along with a reply from Mr. XXXX by email indicating that a claimant must pass the Association's review process during which they are observed and assessed by the executive board of the FDA over a period of time within their community. The letter went on to state that because the Appellant was not known to them, they were unable to offer any testimony for him at that time.\n[23] The RPD found that the email from the FDA was inconsistent with the Appellant's testimony that the FDA had agreed to send the letter when he approached them six months before the hearing. The RPD found that the Appellant had not established that he approached the FDA or that they had assessed him and agreed to offer him a letter. The RPD found that this cast serious doubt on his allegations that he is a true and genuine Falun Gong practitioner.\n[24] The Appellant argues that he may have been mistaken in his belief that the FDA had agreed to provide him a letter of support and that this does not necessarily mean that he was untruthful or that he never requested a letter in the first place. He submits that the RPD erred in finding that the FDA email was inconsistent with his testimony as it was equally plausible that he had requested a letter of support and was mistaken regarding the FDA's willingness to send such a letter. He submits that the email from the FDA merely establishes that he had not met the requirements for obtaining a letter of support as he had not yet participated in the FDA's review process of observation and assessment by the executive board members.\n[25] I concur with the RPD that the Appellant's testimony at the hearing that he had made an in-person request to the FDA for a letter of support was inconsistent with the email from the FDA stating that the Appellant was not known to them. I have considered that the Appellant began to practice Falun Gong in Canada in early 2013 with a public practice group in Milliken Park. At the time of the hearing he had allegedly been practicing with the group in this location once per week for approximately five years. In addition, he attended weekly study sessions for two hours every week and went to other Falun Gong events such as the parade celebrating Master Li's birthday. The country conditions documentary evidence states that the FDA will write a letter vouching for a practitioner after going through a verification process. This can be seeking verification through their worldwide network from a reliable practitioner who knew the person in question to have practiced Falun Gong back in China or another country or seeking information on their communication website.11 It is further noted that if a person cannot be verified in that manner, and they exhibit a good understanding of cultivation and the principles of Falun Gong from the time they arrive in Canada to when they asked the Association to vouch for them, they will speak to this in a letter.12 I have considered that the Appellant had been in Canada five years at the time of this hearing and would have had an opportunity to ask the Association for such a letter. However, the Association had no awareness that the Appellant had approached them six months before the hearing, and did not know who he was. I find that this is inconsistent with both the Appellant's testimony and his alleged Falun Gong activity in Canada.\n[26] The Appellant has argued that he may have been mistaken when he thought that a letter was being sent as a result of his visit to the Association six months before the hearing. However, the Appellant also stated at the hearing that he made a follow-up phone call a week before the hearing to inquire about the promised letter, which he alleges the Association stated had already been sent. This is clearly inconsistent with the email finally sent by Mr. XXXX stating that the Appellant was not known to them. I find that the Appellant intentionally tried to mislead the RPD in regard to a letter of support from the FDA, and that this negatively impacts his credibility.\nExit from China\n[27] The Appellant was asked several questions at the hearing regarding his ability to exit China using his own passport. The Appellant testified that he had no problems exiting the country despite being wanted for arrest at the time he left. When asked if he knew why he was not arrested at the airport he replied that he had no idea. When questioned by his counsel he stated that he paid money to a snakehead who prepared his United States (US) visa application and was in line with him at the airport when he left the country. The RPD did not address the Appellant's ability to exit China while being wanted for arrest in its decision. However, I found this to be relevant and asked the Appellant to provide submissions regarding his ability to exit China while being wanted by the authorities.13\n[28] The Appellant responded with submissions which were received by the RAD on July 16, 2020.14 The Appellant argues that he never alleged that there was a summons or arrest warrant issued for him and the fact that he was being sought by the local police did not mean that he was wanted nationwide for arrest or that his information was entered into the Golden Shield system. He submits that the Golden Shield system was not fully developed at the time he left China in 2013 and it is plausible that a person being sought by the authorities could leave the country using his own passport due to shortcomings and loopholes in the system. He argues that corruption is rampant in China and he was able to leave China by way of Hong Kong by using a smuggler.\n[29] The RAD has reviewed the record and notes that the Appellant left mainland China and entered Hong Kong on XXXX XXXX, 2013. His Chinese passport15 in his own name contains a stamp showing he exited China on XXXX XXXX, 2013, as well as stamps showing he entered and departed Hong Kong on the same date. From there he flew to the US. He wrote in the Schedule 12 intake form that he travelled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong by car on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2013 and flew to San Francisco on the same day. He was asked at the hearing whether he was wanted by the authorities at the time he left China and he replied in the affirmative.\n[30] The country conditions documentary evidence states that residents of mainland China travelling to Hong Kong require \"an exit\/entry permit for travelling to Hong Kong ... and the valid endorsement\" from the relevant Public Security Bureau Office.16 Each visitor to Hong Kong must go through a checkpoint upon entry and is issued a landing slip.17 When entering the travel checkpoints a document reader is used to read the barcode and chip on the exit\/entry pass.18 It is noted that passports are used when travelling through Hong Kong en route to a third country.19\n[31] Article 89 of the Exit and Entry Administration Law of the People's Republic of China, states that exit refers to leaving the Chinese Mainland for other countries or regions, for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, for the Macao Special Administrative Region, or for the Taiwan Region.20\n[32] I find that the Appellant exited China when he went to Hong Kong, using his own passport. The stamps on the passport attest to that. I have reviewed the country conditions documentary evidence and I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant would not have been able to leave China using his own identity if he was wanted by the authorities as he has alleged.\n[33] The Appellant has argued that a smuggler helped him to escape China. He wrote in response to question seven of Schedule 12, which asks about the person who helped him to leave the country, that the smuggler assisted him in getting a US visa and arranged all of his routing. He wrote in his Basis of Claim Form that he left China with the help of a smuggler. At the hearing he testified that the smuggler prepared his US visa and left China with him. I find, after conducting an independent analysis, that there is insufficient evidence on the record to support any allegation that the Appellant was able to leave China despite being wanted by the PSB because he used the services of a smuggler. He has provided little detail of what the smuggler did to enable him to exit the country using his own passport despite being wanted by the authorities. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that if the Appellant was indeed wanted by Chinese authorities, this would have been flagged when he exited Mainland China and entered Hong Kong. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant used his own passport to leave China and gain access to Hong Kong and that he was not stopped by the authorities because he was not a person of interest who was wanted as a practitioner of an evil cult.\n[34] I have reviewed the documentary evidence which notes that PSB investigations require \"meticulous documentation of offenders\", and that the PSB \"specifically requires documentation, reporting, and monitoring of potential offenders\".21 I find that it is clear from the Appellant's evidence that he was under investigation and wanted by the authorities as a participant in evil cult activities. I find that the Appellant's information would have been entered into the Golden Shield database, given his particular circumstances. The preponderance of the documentary evidence contained in the record indicates that it is not possible for a person who is under investigation or wanted by the authorities to exit China. I note that article 12 of the Exit and Entry Administration Law of the People's Republic of China states that Chinese citizens are not allowed to exit China when they are suspects or defendants in criminal cases.22 It is also noted in the documentary evidence that passports and travellers are thoroughly examined by immigration and customs officials in China using advanced technology, real name online registration requirements, and GPS monitoring.23\n[35] The documentary evidence shows that the Golden Shield system has been used to track down cult practitioners. Country documentation indicates that:\n... [t]he Chinese economist writing in Open Magazine affirms that \"Cisco's Policenet has been helping the [Chinese Communist Party]'s public security organs to ferret out political dissidents and Falun Gong practitioners for years\". [citation omitted]24\n[36] Moreover, according to this same documentation:\nAn undated article on the website of the Ministry of Public Security, entitled \"Deepening the Implementation of the 'Golden Shield' Project,\" indicates that all police units nationwide have access to eight public security databases, including the \"National Basic Population Information Database\". Also accessible through the databases is information on household registration [hukou], border exit and entry, road traffic, and criminal investigations. [citations omitted]25\n[37] Furthermore, the objective evidence is clear that government authorities are taking aggressive actions to root out the practice of Falun Gong in China. Country documentation notes that:\n... the Chinese government established the \"610 Office\" to \"crack down\" on the Falun Gong and other \"heretical cults.\" The US Department of State's International Religious Freedom Report for 2013 states that the Chinese government continues to employ \"610 offices\" \"to eliminate the Falun Gong movement and to address 'evil cults'\". [citations omitted]26\n[38] I find that, given the objective evidence, it is reasonable to believe that if the Appellant was being pursued by the PSB as he alleges, he would have been unable to leave China.\n[39] While there is documentary evidence that indicates that corruption exists within the police force in China, and that authorities in China do not always apply regulations evenly, I find that the preponderance of the documentary evidence does state that authorities at borders conduct thorough screenings. However, there is insufficient evidence in the NDP or in the Appellant's disclosure which establishes that corruption extends to the customs security apparatus.\n[40] I find that the Appellant's allegation that he was able to exit China using his own passport is inconsistent with the documentary evidence in the record. I find that it is not credible or plausible that the Appellant would be able to leave China using his genuine passport if he was wanted by the authorities. The Appellant has argued that he left China in 2013 and the Golden Shield system was not fully implemented at the time. However, I note from the country conditions documentary evidence that there were systems in place at that time to stop individuals from leaving the country:\nIf a foreigner or a Chinese citizen must be prevented from leaving China at a border control station, the people's court accepting the case shall report up the hierarchy to the High People's Court, and a written notification of preventing person from departing through entry-exit port shall be issued by the Highest People's Court, and work with the public security organ of the corresponding level for handle control formalities. If the control port is not within the same province, autonomous region, or municipality directly under the central government, the public security organ in the relevant province, autonomous region, or municipality directly under the central government shall be contacted for the handle control formalities. Under emergency situations, if necessary, may first have the border control prevent departure and complete control formalities later. [citation omitted]27\nIt is additionally noted that political and religious dissidents were prevented from travelling abroad or to Hong Kong in 2013 and that the government exercised exit control for departing passengers at airports and other border crossings.28\n[41] I furthermore find that the Appellant's ability to exit China undermines his central allegation that he was wanted by the PSB for practicing Falun Gong. This finding is also supported by Zeng, Su, and Cao, in which the Federal Court has supported findings that traveling unimpeded through Chinese exit controls is inconsistent with being wanted by Chinese authorities.29 I find that the Appellant has not established, on a balance of probabilities, that a smuggler helped him to evade detection by the authorities when he exited China.\n[42] I have considered the Appellant's ability to exit China, using his own identity documents, despite allegedly being wanted by the PSB for practicing Falun Gong, which the authorities consider an evil cult, and have noted the above credibility findings relating to the Appellant's knowledge of Falun Gong and support from the FDA. I note that the Appellant has provided no supporting documentation relating to events in China other than a wedding invitation30 for the date his practice was allegedly raided by the PSB. I assign no weight to this invitation in establishing that the Appellant was a practitioner of Falun Gong in China as it only establishes that a wedding occurred. I find that the Appellant has not established on a balance of probabilities that he was a practitioner of Falun Gong in China and that he was wanted by the authorities in China for that practice.\nFalun Gong Identity and Sur Place Claim\n[43] The RPD found that the Appellant had not established his identity as a genuine Falun Gong practitioner. This conclusion was based on the negative credibility findings which the RPD found were central to the core issues of the claim.\n[44] The RPD assigned no weight to the photographs and support letters from fellow Canadian practitioners finding that these documents did not overcome the credibility concerns. The RPD found that the photographs did not establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant is a genuine and committed Falun Gong practitioner or that any of the activities he may have engaged in since coming to Canada have come to the attention of the Chinese authorities. The RPD considered that the support letter from 2013 was basic, not notarized and was not accompanied by an identification document of the alleged author. The post hearing letter of support submitted by the Appellant was given little weight as the RPD did not have the opportunity to ask the Appellant about its contents in order to assess its veracity.\n[45] The Appellant argues that the RPD's improper assessment of his credibility negatively impacted its assessment of the weight of the photographs and of the letters of support. He submits that although he stated at the hearing that he did not believe the Chinese authorities were aware of his Falun Gong practice in Canada, his statement should not be relied upon to support the RPD's finding that the Chinese authorities would not be interested in him should he return to China. He argues that he had no way to know with any degree of certainty if the Chinese authorities were aware of his activities in Canada. He submits that the country conditions documentation shows that a person may be pursued and persecuted by the Chinese authorities even if they practice Falun Gong outside of China.\n[46] Having found that the Appellant was not wanted by the authorities for his involvement in Falun Gong activities in China, I must consider whether the Appellant is a genuine practitioner of Falun Gong in this country. The Appellant has alleged that the impetus to begin his practice in Canada took place as a result of a set of circumstances which occurred in China. He alleged that his continued practice of Falun Gong in Canada is based on his adherence to his alleged practice in China.\n[47] I have found that the Appellant was not credible about his practice of Falun Gong in China, and having no evidence of an impetus to practice Falun Gong in Canada, I find, on a balance of probabilities, and in the context of the findings noted above, that the Appellant joined Falun Gong practice and study groups and has learned about the practice and philosophy of Falun Gong in Canada only for the purpose of supporting a fraudulent refugee claim. In the context, as noted above, and on the basis of the totality of evidence disclosed, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant is not presently a genuine practitioner of Falun Gong.\n[48] I find that the Appellant's attendance at Falun Gong groups and events in Canada can only attest to his participation in Falun Gong activities but cannot attest to his motivation. In this regard, case law31 indicates that a pastor's assessment of the genuineness of a person's faith cannot be substituted for the assessment that the panel is required to make. I give little evidentiary weight to the letters from fellow practitioners.32\n[49] I accept that the Appellant had some knowledge of Falun Gong, and that the Appellant had photographs33 taken of himself participating in Falun Gong activities. However, given the negative credibility findings as noted in this decision, I find that the Appellant has learned about the practice of Falun Gong in Canada with the purpose of supporting a fraudulent refugee claim.\n[50] I additionally find that the Appellant has not established, on a balance of probabilities, that his Falun Gong activities in Canada have or will bring him to the attention of Chinese authorities. I further find that the likelihood that he would practice Falun Gong upon return to China is minimal, given the finding that he is not a genuine practitioner.\nCONCLUSION\n[51] I have found, after conducting an independent assessment of the evidence, that the Appellant is not a genuine practitioner of Falun Gong. I further find that there is not a serious possibility that he would be persecuted should he return to China, nor would he be subjected personally, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to life, a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture, should he return to China.\n[52] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.34\n(signed)\nLinda Hart\nLinda Hart\nJuly 27, 2020\nDate\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD File \/ Dossier de la SAR : TB8-13704\nRAD.25.02 (January, 2020)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n2\nImmigration and Refugee\nBoard of Canada\nRefugee Appeal Division\nCommission de l'immigration\net du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 du Canada\nSection d'appel des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s\nRAD.25.02 (January, 2020)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] XXXX XXXX a.k.a. XXXX XXXX (Appellant) appealed the February 20, 2019 decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) that rejected his claim for refugee protection.\nDECISION\n[2] The appeal is dismissed.\nOVERVIEW\n[3] The facts in this case are relatively undisputed. The Appellant is an ethnic Tibetan whose parents fled to India in 1960 after the Chinese invasion. The Appellant was born in India in 1985 and was formally educated through Tibetan institutions including the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, India. He is a XXXX trained in the Tibetan culture.\n[4] The Appellant has some international travel history. In XXXX 2014 he traveled to Switzerland to volunteer with 'XXXX XXXX XXXX', where he met other Tibetans. He explored the possibility of seeking asylum in Switzerland but, through informal enquiries, he learned that only Tibetans born in Tibet would be accepted, not those from India. Also in 2014, the Appellant was rejected for a student related trip to the USA. In 2015, a visa application for Canada was rejected. In XXXX 2016, an application for a USA visitor visa was rejected.\n[5] The Appellant secured employment with the XXXX XXXX XXXX in 2015 and is still employed in this organization, which he described as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The Appellant married in India in XXXX 2017 and has one child.\n[6] In XXXX 2017, the Appellant was granted a US visa to attend the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX at the XXXX XXXX XXXX. The Appellant left India on XXXX XXXX, 2017 and spent XXXX weeks in the USA, where he enquired about asylum. He decided not to apply in the USA and traveled across the border to Canada where made a refugee claim on October 13, 2017.\n[7] The Appellant fears deportation to China because he lacks citizenship in India. He claims that he will be persecuted in Tibet for religious beliefs as a follower of the Dalai Lama and for political opinions relating to his work in preservation of Tibetan culture and public commentary against the Chinese policy of assimilation.\n[8] The Appellant's status in India has been by way of an annually renewable Registered Foreigners' Certificate (RC) that is currently expired.\nThe RPD decision\n[9] The RPD member correctly identified the legal principal that a claimant cannot be given refugee protection when they have citizenship available to them in another safe country and it is within their power to acquire that citizenship.1 The determinative finding for rejecting the claim was that the Appellant has a right to citizenship in India and that it is within the Appellant's control to access that citizenship.\n[10] The RPD member reviewed the law and jurisprudence, including Section 3(1) of the Indian Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003, which confers the right of citizenship to Tibetans born in India between 1950 and 1987, such as the Appellant. The RPD member reviewed disparate views that are evident in the applicable jurisprudence and commentaries, considered the Appellant's specific circumstances, and concluded that his right to citizenship in India would be recognized by the Indian government and that it is within the Appellant's control to access that citizenship.\nANALYSIS\n[11] There is no dispute from the Appellant that India is a potential country of nationality for this Appellant because he falls within the scope of the law affording citizenship to persons born in India between 1950 and 1987. The Appellant agrees with the legal test set out in paragraph [7] of the RPD decision where the member confirms the statutory right of citizenship for the Appellant being India but that \"one must consider what happens in practice as well as whether there are any particular obstacles faced by the claimant in the case at hand.\"\n[12] The Appellant takes issue with the RPD member's findings and conclusion about the circumstantial component of the test for citizenship access. He argues that the RPD member failed to give appropriate weight to evidence of the practical obstacles affecting the issuing of passports by local authorities to Tibetan exiles in India. The Appellant argues that evidence fails to establish that he will likely be granted a passport and other citizenship rights if he applies for them in India.\n[13] The determinative question is whether the RPD member was correct to find that it is within the Appellant's control to access the right of citizenship in India and that he did not make reasonable efforts to do so.\n[14] In his memorandum of argument, the Appellant referenced a Federal Court of Appeal (FCA) decision, Tretsang v. MCI, 2016 FCA 2752 but likely intended to refer to the case of Tretsetsang v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) FCA 2016 FCA 175. The RPD member relied on the majority reasoning in that case and, despite expressing some concern with the FCA's reasoning, the Appellant endorses its two part test for assessing whether a claimant has met the onus of establishing inability or justified unwillingness to avail herself or himself of the protection of the country of nationality.3 That test is applicable and the circumstances of that case are instructive in this appeal because the case also concerned a Tibetan exile born in India who fell within the same range of birth years for access to Indian citizenship.\n[15] The Tretsetsang case confirms that, in order to reject India as a country of nationality, the onus is on the Appellant to show (i) significant impediment(s) reasonably prevented him from exercising the citizenship rights and (ii) that reasonable efforts were made to overcome such impediment and that such efforts were unsuccessful such that the claimant was unable to obtain the state's protection.\n[16] The Appellant submits that the first part of the two part test is satisfied because there are significant impediments that reasonably prevented him from trying to exercise citizenship rights in India and that prevent him from applying for a passport in India. For reasons that follow, I disagree and find that the RPD member was correct to conclude otherwise.\n[17] Based on the evidence before them, the FCA in Tretsetsang confirmed the legal entitlement of Indian citizenship for Tibetans born in the stipulated period. The FCA endorsed these two critical findings of the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) in relation to Mr. Tretsetsang: that he had failed to establish that his Indian citizenship rights would not provide him with state protection, and appropriate rejection of his argument that India would not recognize his citizenship right without being forced to do so through a court application. The FCA concurred with the RAD's conclusion that in not taking any steps at all to determine whether India would recognize him as a citizen without requiring him to litigate the matter, Mr. Tretsetsang had failed to establish that there was any impediment, much less any significant impediment, to his ability to access the state protect rights inherent in his Indian citizenship. The FCA went on to answer its Reformulated Certified Question as follows:4\nQuestion: Is any impediment that a refugee claimant may face in accessing state protection in a country in which that claimant is a citizen sufficient to exclude that country from the scope of the expressions \"countries of nationality\" and \"country of nationality\" in section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act?\nAnswer: No.\n[18] The circumstances in Tretsetsang are similar to this case. The RPD member adopted the FCA's reasoning and approach in Tretsetsang and found that the Appellant, Mr. Tsering, has similarly not made reasonable efforts to access his citizenship benefits in India. It rejected the Appellant's reasons for not doing so as involving fears that were speculative.\n[19] The Appellant's main argument against the RPD decision is that the gap between the law and its implementation makes it unlikely that the Appellant would obtain citizenship if he applied.5\n[20] The Appellant understandably interchanges commentary and argument about obtaining a passport with citizenship because of the documentary evidence that speaks to the manner in which passport applications are handled for Tibetans in India. The law confers citizenship on Tibetans like the Appellant who were born in Tibet but the documentary evidence reports that, upon making a passport application, Tibetans must relinquish their Resident Card (RC) and engage consequences of having to leave their settlement area and forfeit privileges and benefits from the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA). A December 23, 2016 press release from the Ministry of External Affairs6 announced new passport rules, explaining the process and documents required by an applicant and, according to that guide, the Appellant has the necessary documents or the ability to access the required documents, to make a passport application. The RPD member canvassed efforts made by the Appellant and concluded that he did not make reasonable attempts to secure, for example, a birth certificate, and that he has other documents such as a non-expiring AADHAAR (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) card and an expired but renewable RC card, that would satisfy the documentary requirements for obtaining a passport as set out in the December 23, 2016 press release. I agree with the RPD member for the reasons given. The Appellant's arguments vaguely refer to applying twice in Canada for a passport and that in India he tried to obtain documents he needed to apply but his BOC narrative refers only to two visa applications for Canada and obtained identity documents sufficient for travel but did not demonstrate that he sought Indian citizenship. Rather, he explained not doing so because of a perception that he would suffer negative response from officials and negative repercussions personally if he did so.\n[21] The Appellant expressed concerns that are specific to his circumstances, citing the effect of a memorandum from the Kashag secretariat's office on Year 2017 Month 7 Day 5 that\naddresses the topic of passports for Tibetans in exile. That memorandum sets out four rules that underlie the discussions and concerns expressed in the articles about access to passports by Tibetans:7\n1) Those who apply to become Indian citizen must return the refugee document {R.C) and the yellow travel document (Identity Certificate in Lieu of Passport),\n2) Cannot be a resident of the Tibetan refugee settlements,\n3) Must, in writing, declare to not request for resources from the Tibetan administration (CTA),\n4) And must, in writing, declare to not request for recourses made available to Tibetan refugees and to return any currently possessed.\n[22] The Appellant's main arguments against the RPD decision include that, despite apparent access to Indian citizenship and a passport, the impediments faced by Tibetans like him include continuing refusals by local authorities to issue passports and an alleged fear of imprisonment in India or deportation to Tibet from India because of his expired RC card. The Appellant relies heavily on the case and related articles concerning Lobsang Wangyal, who won a High Court case after being refused a passport. The Appellant submits that the FCA in Tretsetsang did not have that evidence before it and he points to 2017 posts by Wangyal of Tibetans facing discrimination and even harassment when applying for passports and arbitrary rules imposed by local authorities when Tibetans apply for passports, including the requirement to produce evidence of a permanent address, imposition of fines and failure to assist Tibetans with information. The Appellant submits that, as a result, Tibetans have no choice to but to appeal to courts for relief and that most Tibetans, including the Appellant, cannot afford litigating and remains vulnerable to refusals by local officials.\n[23] Based on the evidence before me, I find that the Appellant's concern about not being issued a passport without litigation is not supported on a balance of probabilities. He has not applied for a passport. The country documents and articles offered in support of his claim refer to litigation in specific circumstances but also reflect that passports are issued to Tibetans who apply for them. The problem reflected in those articles is less about the issuing of passports than about relinquishing the RC card and related entitlements as Tibetan refugees in exile. That loss of entitlement is not reasonably characterized as a serious impediment as contemplated by the test set out in Tretsetsang. In its certified question, the FCA confirmed that any impediment that a person may face in accessing state protection in a country where citizenship is available is not sufficient to exclude that country from the scope of the country of nationality as provided in section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).8 There must be something significant that reasonably prevents the exercise of citizenship rights.\n[24] The Appellant acknowledges that the Appellant would be likely to obtain a passport in India if he applied for one but argues that his rights in India would not be equal to other citizens in India because of the intolerable burden of homelessness, unemployment and loss of meaningful ties to the Tibetan community living in Tibetan Settlements upon doing so.9 The Appellant is asking, in essence, that ongoing tensions between the status of Tibetan exiles and their rights as Indian citizens be interpreted or characterized as a fact that equates to not having reasonable access to Indian citizenship. The RPD member acknowledged that the Appellant would have choices to make regarding how to celebrate and cultivate his Tibetan identity and correctly pointed out that giving up some of those benefits and attributes of his Tibetan identity would result whether he acquired citizenship in India or in Canada.10 The RPD member correctly identified that difficulties of finding work or schooling for his child outside the Tibetan settlement in India were not sufficient to justify the choice not to apply for an Indian passport, and correctly noted that this 'natural course' occurs irrespective of the country he resides in outside of Tibet. I concur with that reasoning.\n[25] In summary, the Appellant has not shown that he made reasonable efforts to overcome real or perceived impediments to accessing citizenship rights, including applying for a passport, or that efforts he has made such as seeking a birth certificate were unsuccessful. The RPD member correctly concluded that 'difficulties in securing citizenship do not invalidate the requirements to pursue it where it is available'11 and that the Appellant's concerns about orders from the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) or identity as a Tibetan exile are not obligations or requirements set out by the Indian government. The RPD member's assessment of accessibility to Indian citizenship correctly distinguished between what is, in essence, reasonably characterized as a tension between status as a Tibetan exile or as a citizen in India. In finding that the Appellant had not made reasonable efforts in India to have his citizenship rights recognized, the RPD member considered the potential loss of an RC card and other repercussions to benefits of Tibetan exile status and reasonably concluded that the Appellant has access to Indian citizenship should he choose to pursue it. I concur with that assessment.\n[26] The Appellant has proffered arguments concerning harassment or limits to services for a Tibetan in India but did not advance those arguments in support of a claim against India. Rather, they are addressed in relation to the assessment of availability of citizenship in India as discussed above.\n[27] In summary, my assessment of the totality of the evidence and arguments in this appeal do not provide a basis to allow the appeal. The Appellant cannot be given refugee protection in Canada because he has citizenship available to him in India, a safe country, and it is within his power and control to acquire that citizenship.\nCONCLUSION\n[28] The RAD dismisses the appeal and confirms the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection, pursuant to section 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\n(signed)\n\"Maryanne Kingma\"\nMaryanne Kingma\nJune 20, 2019\nDate\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD File \/ Dossier de la SAR : TB9-06416\nRAD.25.02 (April 04, 2019)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n2\nImmigration and Refugee\nBoard of Canada\nRefugee Appeal Division\nCommission de l'immigration\net du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 du Canada\nSection d'appel des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s\nRAD.25.02 (April 04, 2019)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] The Appellant, XXXX XXXX, is a citizen of Iran, and appeals a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) dated September 21, 2016, rejecting his claim for refugee protection. The Appellant is not submitting new evidence and is not requesting a hearing. The Appellant is requesting that the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) set aside the decision of the RPD and refer the matter back to the RPD or that the RAD substitute a determination that the Appellant is a Convention refugee.\nDetermination\n[2] Pursuant to section 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), the Refugee Appeal Division confirms the determination of the Refugee Protection Divsion that the Appellant is not a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nBackground\n[3] The Appellant fears returning to Iran on account of his conversation to Christianity. He arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2014 at Pearson International Airport without a passport or travel documents. The only identity documents in his possession were an Iranian identity card and an Iranian's driver's licence. He claimed at the airport that he fled Iran because he had converted to Christianity and was attending an underground church. He alleges that one of the members of the church was arrested forcing the Appellant to go into hiding.\n[4] He advised the Canadian authorities at the airport that he travelled from Iran to Turkey and then to South America where he remained in one of the South American country for 11 days. He could not provide the name of the country and could only say that there were a lot of churches. He then travelled to another South American country which he could not identify by name but this one had a lot of ships.\n[5] With respect to his travel documents, he stated that he could not remember the name on the false passport which he used to travel from Europe, to South America, to Canada. He stated that, on the advice of the smuggler, he destroyed both his passport and his boarding pass for his travel to Canada before landing at Pearson. A week after arriving in Canada, the Appellant alleges that he was at an Iranian market in Toronto. He approached a stranger at the market and asked him if he was Christian. The stranger replied that he was a Christian, and gave the Appellant the address of the Church which he has been attending in Toronto.\nROLE OF THE RAD\n[6] The RAD finds that the recent Federal Court of Appeal decision, in Huruglica,1 provides the RAD with guidance in relation to the appropriate standard that must be applied by a specialized tribunal such as the RAD to decisions of a first-level administrative tribunal. The Appellant justices stated at paragraphs 103 and 106:\n[103] I conclude from my statutory analysis that with respect to findings of fact (and mixed fact and law) such as the one involved here, which raised no issue of credibility of oral evidence, the RAD is to review RPD decisions applying the correctness standard. Thus, after carefully considering the RPD decision, the RAD carries out its own analysis of the record to determine whether, as submitted by the appellant, the RPD erred. Having done this, the RAD is to provide a final determination, either by confirming the RPD decision or setting it aside and substituting its own determination of the merits of the refugee claim. It is only when the RAD is of the opinion that it cannot provide such a final determination without hearing the oral evidence presented to the RPD that the matter can be referred back to the RPD for redetermination. No other interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions is reasonable.\n[106] In light of paragraphs 23 and 24 above, I would reformulate the certified question as follows:\nWas it reasonable for the RAD to limit its role to a review of the reasonableness of the RPD's findings of fact (or mixed fact and law), which involved no issue of credibility?\nAnswer: No. The RAD ought to have applied the correctness standard of review to determine whether the RPD erred.\n[7] Accordingly, the RAD will conduct its own analysis of the Record to determine if the RPD erred.\nANALSYSIS ON THE MERITS OF THE APPEAL\n[8] The RPD found that the Appellant was not a credible witness. The Appellant alleges that the RPD erred in its credibility analysis.\n[9] There are two credibility issues in this Appeal:\n* Was the Appellant residing in Iran in 2014, at the time that he alleges that he was attending an underground Christian Church?\n* Did the Appellant convert to Christianity?\nThe Appellant's residence in Iran in 2014\n[10] The Appellant alleges that he is being sought by the Iranian authorities. He stated that he received information through XXXX communications that agents of the state had been looking for him. The RPD asked the Appellant for the records of this communication and he replied that he had deleted them two days prior to the hearing. The RPD rejected this explanation and drew a negative inference with respect to this information.\n[11] The Appellant does not challenge this particular credibility finding of the RPD. It is reasonable to expect that an individual who claims that he is being sought by the authorities in his home country, would keep any record which was available to him which would indicate the authenticity of these documents. Destroying the records of communication two days before the RPD hearing is, in the opinion of the RAD, an embellishment of the Appellant's testimony. The RAD finds that the Appellant did not receive any information through Viper communication indicating to him that the authorities in Iran had been looking for him.\n[12] The Appellant stated that he had travelled to Canada on a false passport, using an alias, stopping in Turkey, and two unknown South American countries before arriving in Canada and that he was not aware of the name on the false passport. He stated that he destroyed the passport, along with his boarding pass, on his flight to Canada. The RPD concluded that the Appellant had not established his travel plans to Canada.\n[13] The RAD cannot accept the explanation of the Appellant that he did not know that name on his false passport. He alleges that he travelled through at least three countries before arriving in Canada. It is reasonable to expect that anyone travelling with a false passport would know the details of the passport, including the name on the passport, in the event he was questioned at one of the countries where he landed. By alleging that he did not know the name on the passport, the Appellant ran the risk of being deported if he had been questioned with respect to his identity by the authorities.\n[14] Furthermore, the RPD pointed out to the Appellant that when he had filed his immigration papers, and during his oral testimony at the first hearing of the RPD, he had stated that he had never used an alias. The Appellant did not provide an explanation for this contradictory testimony, only stating that he had to use an alias in order to travel. The Appellant argues that this is microscopic questioning. The RAD cannot agree with this submission. The question for the RAD is that the Appellant, when confronted with the discrepancy between his written testimony, the oral testimony at the first, and the oral testimony at his subsequent hearings, provided no explanation. It is reasonable to expect that the Appellant would have provided a reasonable explanation for this discrepancy.\n[15] When asked why he had destroyed his passport and his boarding pass to Canada, the Appellant stated that he had done so on the advice of his smuggler. The RPD rejected this explanation. The Appellant challenges the RPD credibility finding with respect to the destruction of the boarding pass. He submits that it is reasonable for him to have followed the instruction of the smuggler. The RAD cannot agree with this submission. The passport, although false and having been issued under alias, would have substantiated the Appellant's allegation that he had lived in Iran in 2014 by showing the date of exit and entry of the Appellant's numerous trips on his way to Canada.2 The Appellant was fully aware that he wanted to come to Canada to make a refugee claim. In fact he did so upon his arrival at Pearson airport. It is reasonable to expect that he would have kept every important piece of information which would have assisted him in corroborating his claim. This he did not do.\n[16] Finally, the Appellant stated that he travelled to a number of South American countries but could not recall the names of these countries. The RAD cannot agree with this testimony. It is reasonable to expect that anyone travelling to a foreign country would be aware of the country where he travels to, especially if he alleges that he resided in that country for 11 days. The RAD finds that the Appellant was not forthcoming in his testimony with respect to the names of the South American countries where he travelled to prior to his arrival in Canada.\n[17] The RAD cannot accept any of the testimony with respect to the Appellant's allegations with respect to his travels prior to arriving in Canada. As the Federal Court has stated, theses explanations \"... strain credulity to suggest that they would not be aware of this basic information in the face of the obvious likelihood that they would be questioned about it in transit.\"3 The RAD agrees with the RPD that the Appellant did not establish that he resided in Iran in 2014 when he allegedly converted to Christianity and was attending an underground church.\n[18] With respect to the documentation submitted by the Appellant with respect to this allegation, given the credibility findings outlined above, the RAD concludes that these documents were submitted in order to embellish the Appellant's refugee claim.\nThe Appellant's activities in a Christian Church in Canada\n[19] The Appellant submitted a number of documents, including a baptismal certificate, and oral testimony, which support his allegation that he has joined a Christian Church in Canada. A week after arriving in Canada, the Appellant alleges that he was at an Iranian market, approached a total stranger and asked him if he was Christian. This individual then directed the Appellant to the XXXX XXXX Church where he was baptized on XXXX XXXX, 2014. This fortunate encounter with a total Iranian stranger proved to be a blessing for the Appellant for the stranger was not only a Christian but was able to direct the Appellant to a church which had an Iranian Fellowship Ministry.\n[20] The question for the RAD to consider is whether the Appellant's conversion to Christianity was an authentic conversion or did he allow himself to be baptized in order to be able to apply for refugee protection. The RPD, after reviewing the documentary evidence and the oral evidence of the Appellant and the Appellant's pastor, concluded that, given the findings with respect to the Appellant's general credibility, he was not a genuine Christian4. The Appellant argues that the RAD should not support the general credibility findings of the RPD, accept the documentary evidence submitted by the Appellant, and conclude that the Appellant is a genuine Christian.5 The RAD notes however, that the Appellant did not provide any reference to the oral testimony of the Appellant which would corroborate his allegation that he is a genuine Christian.\n[21] When attempting to discern an individual's religious beliefs, it is established Canadian law that it is not the objectivity of the religious beliefs that matters, nor their validity, but rather the sincerity of the applicant's religious beliefs.6 The RAD has had an opportunity to listen to the recordings of the RPD. At the December 9, 2015 session, the Appellant was questioned by the RPD with respect to his knowledge of Christianity. At this session, the Appellant had a difficult time naming some of the Christian religious feasts and their dates. At the subsequent session on December 16, 2015, the Appellant provided the RPD with a diagram of the liturgical year and proceeded to explain in great detail the feasts and the symbols used for that feast. For example, for the season of Advent he explained why there are four candles, when they are lit, and the symbol of each candle. He was also able to provide information with respect to some of the characters associated with the feast. He provided minute detail as to where and who the wise men of the feast of the Epiphany were.\n[22] When asked by the RPD why he had not been able to provide this same information at the previous hearing, the Appellant admitted that he had been slow in providing answers to the questions of the RPD but since he had been able to obtain assistance and wrote the answers down so he could provide them to the RPD (December 16, session at 13 minute). The RAD cannot accept this explanation. The Appellant arrived in Canada in September of 2014 and immediately joined a Christian church. These particular hearing were held in December of 2015, nearly a year and a half after him joining St. Luke's church. It is reasonable to expect that the Appellant, knowing that he would be questioned on his religious beliefs, would have made every effort to prepare himself so that he could demonstrate his religious convictions and knowledge. Yet at the December 9, 2015 hearing, he was only able to provide very limited religious information to the RPD. It was only after a week of obvious intense training that on December 16, 2015, he was able to provide very detailed knowledge of the Christian practices. It was obvious to the RAD, after listening to the recording of the December 16, 2015 session, the Appellant provided his answers in a manner that indicated that he had memorized the material. For someone who had been practicing Christianity in Canada for over a year and half, the Appellant should have been more spontaneous in his answers.\n[23] The RAD also noted that the Appellant always referred to the \"holy book\" never once calling it the Bible. Although the Bible is a holy book, it would have been reasonable to expect the Appellant to reference the holy book as the bible on a number of occasions. In his presentation, the Appellant also referred to Christians as the third persons and never gave the impression that he himself belonged to the group whom he referred to as Christians. Although these aspects are not detrimental to the testimony of the Appellant, they do demonstrate that his presentation was a memorized one.\n[24] What is more troubling to the RAD is the fact that the Appellant, when referring to the Sunday after Holy Friday, he simply said that this was an important Sunday for Christians never once referring to this day as Easter. Easter Sunday is the holiest of days for Christians. It is reasonable to expect that the Appellant, who allegedly had been practicing Christianity since 2014 and for a year and half in Canada, would have referred to his day as Easter and not as a special day for Christians.\n[25] Given these credibility concerns, the RAD gives little evidentiary weight to the testimony of the Appellant who is not sincere in his religious beliefs and that he allowed himself to be baptized solely for the purpose of embellishing his refugee claim. Given this credibility finding, the RAD also gives little weight to the written and oral testimony provided on behalf of the Appellant concerning his activities in St. Luke's Church.\n[26] As the Federal Court has stated, the Board must consider the totality of the evidence concerning the Appellants' practices.7 This is not a question of the Appellant converting to Christianity after his arrival in Canada. In the appeal the Appellant alleges that he converted to Christianity in 2014 while still residing in Iran and that he specifically came to Canada to claim refugee status based on his religious conversion. The RAD must consider the totality of the Appellant's evidence including his allegations prior to his arrival to Canada.\n[27] The RAD outlined serious credibility concerns with respect to the Appellant's travel to Canada, some of these concerns bordered on incredulity such as his inability to recall the names of the countries where he had stayed in South America and his reasons for destroying his passport which would have corroborated his travel itinerary.\n[28] Given the totality of the evidence, the RAD agrees with the RPD that the Appellant is not a genuine Christian.\nDECISION\n[29] Pursuant to section 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the Refugee Appeal Division confirms the determination of the Refugee Protection Division that the Appellant is not a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n[30] The Appeal is dismissed.\n(signed)\n\"Pasquale Fiorino\"\nPasquale Fiorino\nJanuary 31, 2017\nDate\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD.25.02 (June 23, 2014)\nRAD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SAR :\nTB6-14568\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX (the Appellant) is a citizen of India. He fears persecution or harm if he returns to India from his brother, who wants revenge over a property dispute, and from the police who, acting on the instruction of his brother, have falsely accused the Appellant of being involved with militants.\n[2] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejected the Appellant's claim because they determined that he has a safe and reasonable Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) in Mumbai.\n[3] The Appellant is appealing the RPD decision. He argues that the RPD erred in its IFA analysis, particularly regarding the ability of the police to locate the Appellant in Mumbai. The Appellant also argues that the RPD erred by failing to consider the rights and obligations under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the United Nations Convention Against Torture.\n[4] New evidence has been submitted in this appeal. An oral hearing is requested if there are credibility concerns related to the new evidence.\n[5] The determinative issue in this appeal is whether the RPD erred in its IFA analysis.\nDECISION\n[6] I dismiss the appeal. The Appellant has a safe and reasonable IFA. Therefore, the RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee, nor a person in need of protection.\nBACKGROUND AND ALLEGATIONS\n[7] The Appellant alleges that his brother is involved with gangs and illegal activities. The Appellant and his parents (who are both now deceased) publicly disowned the brother in newspaper ads in 2003.\n[8] In 2015, the Appellant and his brother were involved in a dispute over the ownership of the property that their parents used to own. They resolved the matter in court by way of a mediated agreement and each brother now has a share in the property. The Appellant alleges that his brother wants full ownership of the property and has threatened to harm the Appellant if he does not give him full ownership.\n[9] In XXXX 2017, the police detained the Appellant for questioning. He was falsely accused of supporting pro-Khalistan militants. The Appellant's brother was mentioned during the questioning. The Appellant was beaten and released upon the payment of a bribe.\n[10] The Appellant states that his brother, out of revenge over their property dispute, made use of his powerful political connections to influence some corrupt police officers to question and falsely accuse him of being a militant.\n[11] On two further occasions in late XXXX\/early XXXX 2017, the Appellant was questioned by the police and falsely accused of being linked to militants. He was released the same day on both occasions. In XXXX 2017, the Appellant was again questioned by the police.\n[12] The Appellant decided that it was not safe for him to remain in India, so he hired an agent to obtain a Canadian visa for him. He came to Canada in XXXX 2017 and applied for refugee protection a year later in XXXX 2018.\nNEW EVIDENCE\nThe evidence presented by the Appellant is rejected\n[13] According to the law,1 I can only accept evidence that:\n(i) arose after the RPD decision; or\n(ii) was not reasonably available at the time of the decision; or\n(iii) that you could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to bring to the RPD before the decision.\n[14] If the evidence meets one or more of these requirements, I must decide if the evidence is new, credible, and relevant before I can accept it.2\n[15] The Appellant submitted an affidavit from his wife and an affidavit from his neighbour as new evidence in this appeal. The affidavits corroborate many of the details that the Appellant provided in his testimony at the RPD hearing.\n[16] The Appellant states that the affidavits were not provided during the RPD proceedings because his wife and his neighbour were worried about what the Appellant's brother may do to them if he found out that they were assisting the Appellant.\n[17] While I understand that the wife and neighbour may have been worried about providing affidavits, and that this led to their decision not to provide them to the RPD, this does not meet the requirements of the law for the admission of new evidence. Their evidence was reasonably available at the time of the RPD's decision, but they decided not to provide it. An appeal is not an opportunity to reargue your claim or to correct a deficient evidentiary record in hopes of a better outcome.\n[18] Furthermore, the affidavits do not provide new evidence. They repeat evidence that was already provided during the RPD hearing about the past threats that the Appellant has faced and that the Appellant's brother, as well as the police, are still motivated to find him. That evidence is already before me in the RPD record and will be considered in my analysis.\n[19] Since the evidence does not meet the requirements of the law, it must be rejected.\nThe request for an oral hearing is refused\n[20] The request for an oral hearing is refused. An appeal before the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) must proceed without an oral hearing3 unless certain requirements are met. An oral hearing is not permissible because the requirements of subsection 110(6) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) have not been met. No new evidence was admitted. Without new evidence, an oral hearing is not permitted.\nANALYSIS\n[21] My role is to look at all of the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.4 I have conducted my own independent analysis of the evidence. This included listening to the recording of the RPD hearing and reviewing all of the documents submitted.\nThe RPD did not err in its IFA analysis\n[22] An IFA means that there is another city or area in India where the Appellant can live safely. If there is an IFA, then the Appellant does not need to seek refuge or safety in Canada. As a result, his claim for refugee protection would be denied since a finding that there is a viable IFA is determinative of a claim, whether it is assessed under section 96 or 97 of the IRPA.\n[23] There is a two-part test to determine if there is an IFA. The IFA must be safe, and it must be reasonable. It is safe if there is no serious possibility of persecution, or a risk to life, or cruel and unusual punishment or torture. It is reasonable if conditions in the IFA are not unduly harsh and do not jeopardize the life or safety of the Appellant. The RPD correctly identified and applied the two-part test.\n[24] In determining safety, the agent of persecution's interest in and ability to find the Appellant is considered. The Appellant's circumstances and the general circumstances in the proposed IFA location are also considered.\n[25] In determining reasonableness, the Appellant's personal situation is considered, such as language, religion, ethnicity, education, and ability to earn a living. Establishing unreasonableness requires the existence of conditions in the IFA which would jeopardize the life or safety of the Appellant.5 The Appellant must show actual concrete evidence of such conditions. His belief that he will be in jeopardy is not sufficient.\n[26] Once the Board proposes a specific IFA, the onus or burden is on the Appellant to establish that the proposed IFA location is not safe and reasonable. The Appellant has not met this burden.\n[27] The RPD proposed Mumbai as a potential IFA location at the hearing. The RPD Member questioned the Appellant on this issue. The Appellant stated that Mumbai is not a viable IFA because the police will be able to find him there.\n[28] For the reasons set out below, I agree with the RPD and find that the Appellant has a safe and reasonable IFA in Mumbai. He has not met the burden of establishing that the IFA location is unsafe or unreasonable.\nInsufficient evidence of the Appellant's brother's ability to locate the Appellant\n[29] The Appellant argues that his brother will be able to find him in Mumbai because he has powerful political connections, and those connections will help him find the Appellant. However, there is insufficient evidence that the brother has powerful connections that he can make use of, or how his connections would be able to find the Appellant in Mumbai, which is located thousands of kilometers away from where the Appellant used to live and has a population of millions.\n[30] I recognize that the Appellant's sworn testimony is presumed to be true. While he may genuinely believe that his brother has powerful political connections which will enable him to find the Appellant in Mumbai, that belief does not make it true.\n[31] The Federal Court has determined that the presumption of truthfulness applies to the credibility of facts alleged in sworn statements, but not to their trustworthiness. Credible evidence must also be shown to be trustworthy, usually through corroboration. The presumption of truthfulness does not excuse a claimant from making a genuine effort to provide corroborative evidence to establish the trustworthiness of their sworn statements. This is required by subsection 170(h) of the IRPA as well as Rule 11 of the RPD Rules.6\n[32] The Federal Court has also recently determined that, when a claimant makes a statement having a decisive impact, it should be accompanied by sufficiently convincing proof or, as an alternative, by sufficient efforts to obtain that proof.7\n[33] Also, in a recent case where a claimant similarly stated that she does not have an IFA because her father can find her anywhere in Nigeria, the Federal Court found that the claimant's testimony related only to her belief, not to any facts in support of that belief. Therefore, the presumption that her testimony is true was insufficient to establish that she could be found in the IFA.8\n[34] The Appellant testified that his brother hates him because he wants to get the Appellant's share of the property that they both own. Yet, when there was a dispute over that property, the brother did not make use of any powerful political connections. Instead, he took the Appellant to court, where the Appellant and his brother reached a mediated agreement about the percentage of ownership that they each have in the property. This use of a legitimate system (the court) to resolve a property dispute does not suggest that the Appellant's brother has powerful political connections that he can make use of to accomplish his goals by illegitimate means.\n[35] The Appellant did not provide sufficient evidence to establish his brother's connections or how any connections he may have in Punjab state, where the Appellant used to live, could be used to find the Appellant in the city of Mumbai, which is in another state.\nMotivation of the Appellant's brother to locate and harm him\n[36] The Appellant testified that the dispute over the ownership of the property is his brother's motive to locate and harm him.\n[37] The Appellant stated that the last time he and his brother spoke to each other was during the court case involving the property dispute in 2015.9 However, he allegedly heard through his in-laws and his workplace in 2017 that his brother was still threatening him because he wants full ownership of the property.\n[38] The RPD found, on a balance of probabilities, that the alleged threats from the Appellant's brother in 2017, that were not mentioned in the Basis of Claim (BOC) narrative, did not occur. The Appellant has not challenged the RPD's finding in this appeal.\n[39] Although the current or ongoing motivation of the Appellant's brother is not entirely clear, assuming that he is still motivated to harm the Appellant due to the property dispute, the Appellant could give up his share of the property to ensure his safety.\n[40] A person may have to abandon an asset or possession to eliminate a risk and ensure their safety; and it is not unreasonable to expect them to do so, as long as it will not result in them being deprived of the general ability to earn a living, or in the denial of a core human right. A person who has a reasonable option to free themselves from risk is expected to pursue that option.10\n[41] The Appellant did not argue that he would be deprived of the general ability to earn a living or denied a core human right if he renounces his property rights. He said that he does not want to give up his share of the property to his brother because memories of his deceased mother and father are tied to that property. While his ties to the property are understandable, his own life and safety are at stake.\n[42] There is insufficient evidence that the Appellant would be deprived of the general ability to earn a living if he renounces his property rights to ensure his safety. The Appellant worked for years as a XXXX XXXX in India. His ability to earn a living is not tied to his ownership of the property.\n[43] The Appellant has not established the denial of a core human right if he renounces his property rights to ensure his safety. The right to own property is not a core human right.\n[44] The Appellant provided evidence at the RPD hearing that the local police, who are acting upon his brother's instructions, continued to enquire about him after he came to Canada. However, since it has been established in caselaw that it is not unreasonable to expect a person to relinquish an asset to secure their safety, there is insufficient evidence of a future risk to the Appellant from his brother (or the police who are being instructed by his brother) if he renounces his property rights.\nThe motivation of the police\n[45] The Appellant was very clear in his testimony that the police are acting on the instructions of his brother. He stated this more than once. Corrupt police officers falsely accused him of assisting pro-Khalistan militant to harass him and they assisted his brother in extracting his revenge. There is insufficient evidence that the police have their own independent motive to harm the Appellant.\n[46] The police released the Appellant upon the payment of a bribe. Police corruption is widespread in India, and false accusations to harass a person or as a means to extract the payment of a bribe are not uncommon.11\n[47] I disagree with the RPD's determination that the police were motivated to detain the Appellant because they believe that he has links to anti-nationalist militants. The actions of the police do not support a finding that the police believe that the Appellant is an anti-nationalist militant. If that were the case, it is reasonably expected that he would be regarded as a serious safety threat. Yet, the police released the Appellant each time he was questioned, and he was never charged with anything.\nThe ability of the police to locate the Appellant\n[48] However, even if the police are motivated to locate the Appellant outside of the state of Punjab, there is insufficient evidence of their ability to do so.\n[49] Generally speaking, if the agent of persecution is a state actor, then an IFA is often not viable since it is more likely that a state actor has the ability to track a person throughout the country. However, state actors have different levels of influence or power. The Appellant has not presented sufficient evidence to show that the few corrupt Punjab police officers who falsely accused him have any influence or power outside of their own state.\n[50] India does not have a national, general registration system to enable the police to track the location of citizens in their own state, let alone in other states. Police systems operate as \"islands of technology\" and only communicate within their own state or district. For example, a police officer issuing a traffic ticket would be unable to search for a person's traffic violation history in any other states.12\n[51] This description of the lack of a reliable means of state-to-state communication between the police suggests that the police officers in Punjab state, where the Appellant used to live, would not have the general ability to track the Appellant in Mumbai, which is in another state thousands of kilometres away.\n[52] However, the Appellant believes that the existence of certain databases or systems, such as the tenant verification system, or the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) will make it possible for the police to find him in Mumbai. When he tries to rent an apartment, a background check will be done on him, which will alert the police in his hometown to his new location.\nInformation about the Appellant would not be contained in the CCTNS\n[53] The CCTNS is a national database containing information about crime and criminals.13 The Appellant is not a criminal; he has no official arrests or charges against him. The Appellant confirmed that no official paperwork was ever issued concerning him, such as a First Information Report (FIR) or an arrest warrant.\n[54] Although it is possible that there could be information in the CCTNS from sources other than a FIR or an arrest warrant, this is insufficient to establish that there is any information about the Appellant in the CCTNS or in any other criminal database.\n[55] The Appellant was not charged with any crime, no paperwork such as a FIR or an arrest warrant was ever issued, he was beaten in detention, and released upon the payment of a bribe. His interaction with the police is more reasonably characterised as an extrajudicial detention, than an official or sanctioned arrest. The National Documentation Package (NDP) for India reports that no records of any extrajudicial arrests are maintained in any official criminal databases, including the CCTNS.14 Based on this objective evidence, on a balance of probabilities, no information about the Appellant would be contained in the CCTNS or any criminal database.\n[56] As a result, any background check that could be conducted on the Appellant for the purpose of securing housing or employment is not likely to alert the police in his hometown to his new location.\nThe tenant verification system\n[57] The Appellant argues that the mandatory tenant verification system that is in use in India, including in Mumbai, will alert the police in his hometown to his new location.\n[58] The tenant verification system came into effect in India a number of years ago. Its purpose is to provide the authorities with information about all tenants so that they can track criminals and terrorists. It is mandatory for landlords to provide the local police with details about the identity of their tenants. Landlords can also request a background check on their tenants to determine if they have a criminal background. In practice, many landlords do not provide information about their tenants to the police and, if they do, the police lack the time or resources to do background checks on the millions of tenants in India.15\n[59] Given the size of India's population, the system is difficult to implement. It is reported that it is impossible for the police to verify the identity of all tenants since the police lack the resources to do so many verification checks. For example, the Mumbai Police Commissioner stated that, given the lack of resources, the extent of the verification process is to ensure ID documents are not fake by asking to see multiple ID documents.16\n[60] Furthermore, even if a more thorough criminal background check was conducted, as already discussed above, there is unlikely to be information about the Appellant in any criminal database to alert the authorities that he is a person of interest in his hometown.\n[61] There is insufficient objective evidence that the tenant verification system could be used to alert the police in the Appellant's hometown about his whereabouts in the IFA location.\nThe Convention Against Torture and the Charter.\n[62] The Appellant argues that the RPD failed to consider that it is a violation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the United Nations Convention Against Torture to deport him back to India where he will face torture or other human rights abuses. He states that he was already beaten by the police when he was detained, and it is likely to happen again if he returns to India since the police remain interested in him.\n[63] My determinations regarding the ability of the police to locate the Appellant and their ongoing motivation to locate him are applicable in my analysis of the Appellant's argument.\n[64] The risk of torture is directly linked to the police being motivated to track the Appellant, and then having the means to do so. I have determined that the police lack the motivation and\/or the means to track the Appellant.\n[65] Since I have determined that the police are not likely to locate the Appellant in Mumbai, it follows that the Appellant does not face a risk of torture if he returns to India.\n[66] The first part of the IFA test has been met. The Appellant has not established that the IFA is unsafe. He has not established a serious possibility of persecution, or, on a balance of probabilities, a risk to his life, or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or torture.\nThe reasonableness of the proposed IFA location\n[67] The Appellant did not present any evidence regarding any factors that would make Mumbai an unreasonable IFA. The focus of his evidence regarding the IFA was on his safety, since he believes that his brother and\/or the police will be able to find him in the IFA location. This issue has already been addressed above.\nThe location of the IFA is not a barrier to relocating\n[68] There are no legal barriers to relocating. Internal migration is common in India. Freedom of internal movement is protected by the Constitution of India, which gives citizens the right to relocate, reside and settle in any part of the country.17\n[69] Mumbai is the state capital, and a major urban centre with a population of about 21 million.18 No evidence of any hardship due to an inability to travel to Mumbai was presented. It is a large city that is serviced by major roads and transportation services. It is safely and reasonably accessible.\nLanguage and religion are not barriers to relocating\n[70] The Appellant identifies as a Sikh.19 He is not arguing that he will face any religious barriers in Mumbai.\n[71] The Appellant speaks Punjabi.20 He is not arguing that he will face any language barriers in Mumbai.\n[72] Mumbai is a major city. The results of India's census establishes that there are Sikhs in every Indian state and that there is a strong, established Sikh community in every major Indian city. Sikhs often seek help to access housing and other services from local Gurdwaras. Sikh minorities living in large cities have access to employment, housing, education, and healthcare, and are free to practice their religion.21\n[73] There is insufficient evidence of language or religious barriers that would amount to undue hardship in the IFA location.\nEducation, employment, and housing considerations\n[74] The Appellant is not arguing that he will face unreasonable employment or housing barriers in Mumbai.\n[75] The average years of formal education in India is twelve years.22 The Appellant is forty-five years old and has fourteen years of formal education, including two years of post-secondary education. He worked for many years as a XXXX XXXX in India. He also owned his own business for a couple of years.23\n[76] There is insufficient evidence to establish that the Appellant would face unreasonable employment or housing barriers that would amount to undue hardship.\nOther factors considered\n[77] There is a high threshold that must be met to show that an IFA is unreasonable. The Appellant has not met the high threshold to establish that the IFA location is unreasonable.\n[78] While relocating to a new location can present challenges, hardship associated with relocating or being separated from family members is not sufficient to meet the high threshold. The Appellant's preferences about where to live are not relevant. Neither is inconvenience or a reduction in status or quality of life.24\n[79] The fact that the Appellant might be physically and economically better off in Canada than in a safe place in his own country is also not a factor to consider when assessing the reasonableness of an IFA.25\n[80] The second part of the IFA test has been met. The Appellant has not established that living in Mumbai will be unreasonable to the extent that it would be unduly harsh to live there, or that his life or safety will be in jeopardy.\nCONCLUSION\n[81] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee, nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nKaren Wallace\nKaren Wallace\nMay 16, 2022\nDate\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\nRAD File \/ Dossier de la SAR : TC1-22199\nRAD.25.02 (August 20, 2021)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n2\nImmigration and Refugee\nBoard of Canada\nRefugee Appeal Division\nCommission de l'immigration et du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 du Canada\nSection d'appel des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s\nRAD.25.02 (August 20, 2021)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] This is the appeal filed by XXXX XXXX XXXX, a citizen of Togo, against a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rendered on December 1, 2017, rejecting her refugee protection claim.\n[2] The appellant claims that she fears returning to Togo. She states, [translation] \"I don't know what these men want to do to me, and my parents don't protect me.\" This single file contains a Basis of Claim Form1 (BOC Form), which the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada office received on January 21, 2016. The appellant subsequently filed an amended three-and-a-half page account on March 4, 2016.2 In her BOC Form, the appellant indicates at question 2a) that she was attacked twice at the age of 16 and 22. The first incident was an attempted kidnapping in the early evening on XXXX XXXX, 2009. The second incident was when two men entered the home and allegedly raped her. She adds that these people might have been crooks or police officers.\n[3] At question 2h) on the form, the first incident was on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2009, and she adds that she did not get into the car. For the second incident, she continues by writing that three men entered the home and that two of them sexually assaulted her.\n[4] At line 10 of the amended account, the appellant notes that she is correcting the first incident from 2009 to 2007. At line 18, she describes this: The second attack occurred in 2013, I believe in August [translated as it appears in the French version]. Then, at line 23 of the amended account, she notes that she wrote two men because she mentions that she saw only two while the third one was in the living room.\n[5] She continues her account by mentioning that a few days after the incident, she had some bleeding and went to the clinic alone. She allegedly returned there three or four times. Her physical condition deteriorated at the beginning of 2014, and she received treatment until November 2014.\n[6] She went to Accra, in the neighbouring country of Ghana, for a few days on three occasions for her safety and returned to her family home. Lastly, her father decided to send her to study in Canada and bore the costs. She arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2015. However, in November 2015, her father stopped paying for the courses. She searched on the Internet and was advised to file a refugee protection claim. She went to an immigration office on December 14, 2015, and submitted her file on January 19, 2016.\n[7] The RPD rejected the appellant's refugee protection claim because it found that the appellant was not credible and that she was not personally targeted.\n[8] On appeal, the appellant submits the following arguments:\n1. The RPD erred by concluding that the appellant is not persecuted.\n2. The RPD erred by noting that the appellant does not face a risk of persecution based on her particular social group in Togo.\n3. The RPD erred by concluding that the appellant was not persecuted, despite her suffering caused by a group of rapists.\n4. The fact that she did not report the crime to the police is a combination of cultural shame and the belief that the authorities would not help her.\n5. The psychological report indicates the problems after the rape and the fear of being mistreated again.\n[9] Other jurisprudential points are raised in the appellant's memorandum.\n[10] The appellant is asking the RAD to consider all the evidence submitted, to substitute the determination and to grant her refugee status. Also, with all the evidence submitted and the application of the legislation, to recognize the appellant as a refugee. Finally, that the matter be referred to the RPD for re-determination by a differently-constituted panel.\n[11] The appellant is not asking to present new evidence under subsection 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)3 and does not want an oral hearing to be held pursuant to subsection 110(6) of the IRPA.\n[12] The Minister's representative did not intervene in this appeal.\nDETERMINATION\n[13] Under subsection 111(1) of the IRPA, the RAD sets aside the determination and refers the matter to the RPD for re-determination by a differently-constituted panel.\n[14] The appeal is allowed.\nSCOPE OF THE APPEAL\n[15] For questions of fact, of law, and of mixed fact and law, the RAD must apply the standard of correctness in accordance with Huruglica.4\n[16] I conducted an independent analysis of all the evidence on the record, after listening carefully to the hearing, in order to form my own opinion about this refugee protection claim and to determine if the decision rendered by the RPD is correct.\nANALYSIS\n[17] Having reviewed all the testimonial and documentary evidence on the record, the RAD concludes that no in-depth analysis was conducted and that basic questions concerning the alleged facts and issues concerning the appellant's past and future fear were missed.\n[18] The appellant is of the opinion that the RPD failed to adequately assess her fear of persecution, undermining the analysis of the record, and that the impact of this on the decision was such that she would not be persecuted in her country.\n[19] The very essence of this case lies in the appellant's credibility. Despite this, after a brief examination, the RPD member told the appellant that credibility was not an issue and added that he was satisfied with this. He turned it over to the appellant's counsel by stating that he wanted an analysis of the situation of abused women in the country.\n[20] The appellant's counsel then asked the appellant questions. She testified on different topics and added that she believed the three individuals who tried to abduct her came back to her home to rape her. She added that she was not certain about that. The member, noting an addition to the account, quickly questioned the appellant's credibility and reconsidered his previous decision to not refer to her credibility.\n[21] The RPD's decision is rather odd and terse on the topic of the two events alleged by the appellant. In paragraphs 15, 16 and 17, the decision maker confirms that the appellant suffered the abuse in her account. He appears to put a lot of faith in the submitted account, which was not questioned much at the hearing. The RAD understands that the arguments in the RPD's decision confirm that the appellant falls under the particular social group of women pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA. It is only at the end of paragraph 17 of the RPD's decision that the member writes, [translation] \"Her behaviour in staying in the same house and continuing her studies does not show a subjective fear of persecution in Togo.\"\n[22] Afterwards, the RPD member assessed the persecution. In this case, he added that the persecution must be part of a systematic or continuing treatment. According to him, this was an isolated rape. He concluded that he was not satisfied that [translation] \"the claimant's return to Togo would not subject her to a serious possibility of persecution or a probability of being killed, tortured or subjected to a cruel and unusual treatment.\" Ultimately, paragraph 21. The RAD cannot accept such conclusions without having questioned the person and analyzed and explained its reasoning. To render a complete decision, it must review the entirety of the record and not just provide general statements. It must also consider the Chairperson's Guideline 4.\n[23] During the one hour and 59 minute hearing, the RAD noted that the member's introduction lasted over 20 minutes. As he had not read the psychological report, a break was necessary. Then the discussion period began. The member went over the appellant's medical and psychological reports. She answered that she was alright, and that she was sometimes scared but all she wanted to do was study. She did not see a psychologist again, as she did not have the financial means. The member then listed the clinical examinations, the prescriptions and the receipts submitted5 without discussing their content.\n[24] He briefly asked about the period that followed the July 2013 incident and the medical appointments at the XXXX clinic in Togo, which started on February 21, 2014. She testified that she was ashamed and did not tell her parents. She added that she had to find money. The member asked what she did after the sexual assault. She did not go to the police or call the authorities because she could not decide for herself. She added that the police could not help her and would not do anything. These were the only questions the appellant was asked concerning the assault. Therein lies the problem: there should have been a deeper analysis of the allegation of sexual assault.\n[25] The appellant submitted an information form on January 21, 2016. Then, on March 4 of that year, a second account was submitted, reprising the previous wording and making major corrections. The only issue concerned the reason for the different dates for an event. The response offered was that the appellant had made a mistake. Nothing else. At this point, the member should have asked important questions.\n[26] No question was asked concerning the two alleged assaults. The member seemed to take for granted that they were true. He even stated that the report submitted6 confirms the past sexual assault without questioning it. Concerning this rape, the first account states that she was assaulted when she was 22 years old, nothing more. The second account states that the rape happened in 2013, she thinks in August. The appellant was asked no questions about the event, the circumstances, or the timing of the incident, which would have a life-long impact on anyone subjected to such an intimate assault. None. This is a glaring insufficiency, as the two accounts are inconsistent and this central topic should have been given special attention.\n[27] Moreover, the XXXX clinic documents that, according to the appellant, are consultations and treatments following the August 2013 rape, do not support the claims of sexual assault, far from it. There is no mention of rape in the documents. They are gynecological examinations conducted from February 21, 2014, until the fall of the same year, accompanied by prescriptions and samples to be taken. The RPD should have asked questions about these documents.\n[28] Also, considering the fact that the appellant claims that she was raped in August 2013, it would have been highly preferable that she see a doctor in the hours that followed to undergo a full gynecological exam. She waited six months before doing so. She claimed that her family had to build up a nest egg to see a doctor. This argument does not hold up. The family paid important tuition fees so that she could study English in Toronto. Considering the seriousness of rape, the family should have had their daughter treated promptly. The financial argument does not hold up in this case, unless the alleged event did not happen. The RAD also adds that the appellant, an educated woman, testified that there are government resources available, a human rights organization that protects women.\n[29] In addition, the psychological report did not receive all the attention that it deserved. The member seemed to take the content of this text for granted. We highlighted important elements that should have been questioned, analyzed and processed before agreeing with the content of a report that should have received consideration.\n[30] Finally, the last paragraph of the analysis (para. 21 cited above) is incomprehensible. The thorough analysis that every refugee protection claimant's record deserves was not conducted correctly according to standard practices.\n[31] In the circumstances, the RAD can only refer the matter to the RPD for an in-depth analysis by a differently constituted panel. The future panel must listen to the recording of this first hearing. It is vital that the questioning in this case be resumed from the beginning, while considering the questions and answers provided and the guidelines issued. However, the first hearing, conducted on November 24, 2017, and the complete record remain available for the next panel.\nREMEDY\n[32] The RAD refers the matter back to the RPD, giving the directions to the RPD that it considers appropriate, as it concludes that the decision appealed is wrong in law and in fact and that it cannot confirm, set aside or substitute the determination without hearing evidence that was presented to the RPD, pursuant to subsection 111(2) of the IRPA.\n[33] The RAD is therefore using its discretion under subsection 111(1) of the IRPA and refers the matter to the RPD in accordance with these reasons for decision and the directions stated above.\n[34] The appeal is allowed.\n(signed)\nMichel Jobin\nMe Michel Jobin\nOctober 8, 2019\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD File No. \/ No de dossier de la SAR : MB8-04510\nRAD.25.02 (April 4, 2019)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n8\nImmigration and Refugee\nBoard of Canada\nRefugee Appeal Division\nCommission de l'immigration\net du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 du Canada\nSection d'appel des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s\nRAD.25.02 (April 4, 2019)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] The Principal Appellant, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and his three minor children, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXandXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX appeal a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) dated September 26, 2019, rejecting their claims for refugee protection. The Principal Appellant was and continues to be the designated representative for the Minor Appellants. The Appellants ask that the RAD substitute a finding that they are Convention refugees or persons in need of protection, or in the alternative, the Appellants request that the matter be referred back to the RPD for redetermination.1\nDETERMINATION\n[2] I confirm the decision of the RPD that the appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection. As a result, their appeal is dismissed. The RPD found that the Appellants have an internal flight alternative (IFA) in Abuja or Port Harcourt. In other words, the RPD found that they can relocate safely to these cities and that it is not unreasonable to require them to do so. I agree that the Appellants have an IFA in Port Harcourt and this issue is determinative of this appeal.\nBACKGROUND\n[3] The Appellants fear returning to Nigeria as they believe they will be harmed by the family of the Principal Appellant's late wife and the Minor Appellant's mother, as well as members of the Ogboni Secret Society (OSS) and \"Muslim fanatics\" generally. Specifically, they allege that the father of their late wife and mother is an Imam and along with other members of the Muslim community is seeking revenge on them for their mother's conversion to Christianity. Further, they allege that the same agents of persecution will subject XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the Minor female Appellant, to female genital mutilation (FGM). They allege that other members of their family have already been killed by the agents of persecution.\nROLE OF RAD\n[4] As per Huruglica,2 for questions of fact, mixed fact and law, and law, I am to apply the correctness standard. However, in circumstances where the RAD determines that the RPD had a meaningful advantage in assessing the credibility of oral testimony, I may defer to the RPD findings. In this case, I find that the RPD did not benefit from a meaningful advantage in assessing the appellants' evidence. As a result, I have considered the RPD findings on the correctness standard.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[5] Attached to the Appellants' Memorandum is a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX dated XXXX XXXX, 2019. Originally, there were no submissions or explanations of the new evidence provided by the Appellants. However, the RAD notified the Appellants requesting an explanation as to how the evidence meets the criteria of subsection 110(4) of the IRPA, namely that it arose after the RPD decision or that it was either not reasonably available or the Appellants could not have been reasonably expected to present the evidence at time of the RPD decision.3 RAD Rule 3(3)(g) requires Appellants to provide submissions regarding how the documentary evidence they wish to rely on for the purposes of an appeal meets the requirements of subsection 110(4) of IRPA.\n[6] The Appellants provided a brief reply, stating that the letter is intended to corroborate the testimony of XXXX XXXX XXXX in respect to the female appellant having been moved to the school in XXXX in 2014.4 The letter itself provides additional details, including that XXXX XXXX XXXX instructed that his daughter be moved to the XXXX XXXX in XXXX for \"safety purposes after a failed attempt to forcefully take her out of her day school in XXXX XXXX\".5\n[7] Having reviewed the new evidence, I find that this evidence and the content of the letter refer to incidents long before the RPD determination. Specifically, while the letter is dated in XXXX 2019, it actually refers to events occurring in 2014 and lasting, at best, up until XXXX 2017 when the Appellants left Nigeria and the minor Appellant no longer attended the school in question. As considered in Raza,6 this is not truly \"new\" evidence as it aims to prove events from 2014 and long before the RPD determination in September 2019. The Appellants failed to provide an explanation as to why this evidence could not have been obtained earlier. I further find this evidence was easily available to the Appellants as it refers to and provides the minor female Appellant's history at the school she attended and the reasons for her move to another location or campus in XXXX. Given that the reason for the move was safety after an attempted kidnapping, this is evidence that in my view would be reasonable to expect the Appellants to have obtained prior to the RPD decision.\n[8] As a result, for the above stated reasons, I find this does not constitute new evidence as envisioned by subsection 110(4) of IRPA.\nPROCEEDING WITHOUT AN ORAL HEARING\n[9] The Appellants have not established that the new evidence they have presented should be admitted. As a result, given the refusal of the new evidence, I am of the view that an oral hearing is not required pursuant to 110(6) of IRPA. Specifically, the information contained in the new evidence is not central to the claim nor would it justify allowing or rejecting the claim if it was accepted. It must be noted that the RPD did not find that XXXX XXXX XXXX daughter did not move schools in 2014, but rather questioned the timing and reason for the move based on issues it identified with XXXX XXXX XXXX evidence that were not determinative of the claim.7 In my view, this is an attempt to try and patch up the concerns identified with post-hearing evidence.\nANALYSIS\n[10] The determinative issue for the RPD was the availability of an Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) for the appellants the cities of Port Harcourt and Benin City. While the RPD noted some credibility concerns, for the purposes of this appeal, I will only address findings that are related to the IFA analysis and issues outside of it were not determinative and not considered.\n[11] The RPD found the Appellants have not met their burden to establish that they face a serious possibility of persecution or a risk to life in the proposed IFAs, or that it would be objectively unreasonable or unduly harsh to relocate to the areas in question.8 For the purposes of my independent assessment, I have considered Port Harcourt as the IFA.\nReliance on the Jurisprudential Guide (JG)\n[12] The Appellants argue that the RPD incorrectly applied and relied on the JG on Nigeria as the JG focuses on single women and generally non-state actors. It is argued the facts of the Appellants' case are not similar to that of the JG and the RPD ought to have considered the personal circumstances of the Appellants, including specifically XXXX XXXX XXXX who is a father, as well as the incidents that have already occurred, notably the death of the mother and attempted kidnapping of the female Appellant from school.9\n[13] After independently reviewing the evidence and decision, in my view the RPD thoroughly and correctly analyzed and assessed the particular circumstances of the Appellants. This is precisely the analysis required and endorsed in C.A.R.L. v. Canada.10 Further, the RPD explicitly states in its decision the facts that are similar to the JG, such as the fear of FGM, and those that are different, including fearing persecution due to the Appellant's mother and wife converting to Christianity and that the JG concerns single women, clearly turning its mind to the particular circumstances of the Appellants in the present case.11\n[14] In regard to considering what has already occurred to the Appellants' family, this was assessed by the RPD under the first prong of IFA analysis.\nIFA - First prong Analysis\nNo Improper or Inadequate Questioning Regarding IFAs\n[15] The Appellants acknowledge that the RPD properly raised IFA as an issue at the beginning of the hearing. However, they take issue with when and for how long the issue was examined by the RPD, noting that it came late in the hearing and only lasted several minutes, resulting in a denial for the Appellants to present proper evidence and arguments.12\n[16] I see no error with the RPD's approach to considering the IFA issue. While the Appellants are correct in that the issue was explored several hours into the hearing, I am unaware of any authority that requires the RPD to address it at a particular time or portion of the hearing. The RPD examined various aspects of the Appellants' claim in a logical manner, including the potential existence of an IFA. I also note that Counsel for the Appellants was given an opportunity to ask questions, including regarding the IFA. If Counsel felt the RPD did not adequately explore the subject, it was open to them to delve deeper. Finally, if the Appellants or their Counsel was of the view that they were not adequately prepared to address the subject of IFA, it was open to them to seek an adjournment to obtain evidence or prepare their arguments. They chose to do neither. In my view, there was nothing unfair or improper in how the RPD handled this issue.\nCredibility Applies to First Prong IFA Analysis\n[17] The Appellants argue that the RPD erred in considering credibility in the context of the first prong of IFA analysis.13 They point to paragraph 30 of the RPD decision in which the RPD accepted an explanation relating to an apparent contradiction about whether there was an attempted kidnapping on only the female Appellant or on all the minor Appellants. The RPD accepted XXXX XXXX XXXX explanation on this point, but it becomes evident the RPD did not accept the Appellants' entire account regarding the alleged events as it went on to make several critical negative credibility findings.\n[18] I do not agree with the Appellants that the RPD erred by considering and making credibility findings in the context of first prong IFA analysis. Paragraph 170(h) of IRPA explicitly states that decisions are to be made based on evidence adduced that is credible or trustworthy.14 Case law informs us that when making factual findings we are to assess evidence on a balance of probabilities standard, and that \"one cannot be satisfied that the evidence is credible or trustworthy, unless satisfied that it is probably so, not just possibly so\".15 In other words, there is an evidentiary standard and burden for Appellants to meet and for decision makers to consider when making credibility and factual findings that can permeate the entirety of a claim. With respect, to accept otherwise would undermine the integrity of the refugee determination system if decision makers were powerless in carrying out their main duty of fact-finding. Now, it is of course open to the Appellants to challenge specific credibility findings.\nCredibility Related to Motivation and Ability of Agents of Persecution\n[19] The Appellants take issue with some of the credibility findings made by the RPD under the first prong IFA analysis relating to the means and motivation of the agents to find the Appellants. This included findings related to the female Appellant's stay at the XXXX XXXX, places XXXX XXXX XXXX stayed in hiding, sacrifices left at the Appellants' home, and the death of his brother and uncle. It is argued that XXXX XXXX XXXX did not embellish his testimony, provided clear evidence and provided adequate explanations to the contradictions raised.16\n[20] The RPD found that the Appellants did not establish, on balance of probabilities, that they will be discovered in the proposed IFA's by the agents of persecution. In particular, due to a number of adverse credibility findings, the RPD was not satisfied that the agents of persecution \"have the will, the means and the ability to find and harm [the Appellants] in either Benin City or Port Harcourt\".17 I agree with the RPD's findings for the following reasons.\nAddress History Inconsistent with Hiding\n[21] The Appellants argue that the RPD erred in its analysis regarding where, when and with whom XXXX XXXX XXXX stayed after he felt fear for his safety in XXXX 2014 and onward. It is argued his testimony was clear and he stayed for a short time with his friend, but that his main residence was in Lagos. While he moved temporarily from one place to another for safety, he did not find it was necessary to list these addresses on the Schedule A immigration form he completed.18\n[22] The RPD found XXXX XXXX XXXX failed to reasonably explain why he omitted from his testimony that he had stayed with a friend while in hiding, something he mentioned in his BOC. XXXX XXXX XXXX explained that he had forgotten as he was constantly moving but that his movements were not predictable and he knew how to hide well. Further, the RPD noted that XXXX XXXX XXXX did not disclose any other addresses on his declaration beyond his residential address in Lagos, to which he explained he did not know he had to provide addresses where he hid. Overall, the RPD found this evidence was inconsistent and does not support his position that he was in hiding.\n[23] Having independently reviewed the evidence, I agree with the RPD. If indeed XXXX XXXX XXXX did hide with his friend after initially becoming afraid for his safety, it would be reasonable to expect that he would testify to this occurring as such a significant life event, requiring one to hide with a friend for your own safety, would not be easily forgotten. Additionally, it would be expected that he would list this address when asked to disclose all the residential addresses for the past 10 years. As pointed out by the RPD, question 12 requires \"all\" addresses to be listed and this is significant as XXXX XXXX XXXX claimed to be in hiding for about 2 years. The inconsistencies lead me to believe, on a balance of probabilities, that XXXX XXXX XXXX was not hiding.\nSacrifices\n[24] The RPD considered the Appellants' BOC which indicates the first sacrifice occurred in XXXX 2014 when the occult fraternity brought a sacrifice to his residence. However, there is no mention in his BOC of a second sacrifice by the occult fraternity in 2016. XXXX XXXX XXXX explained that he did not remember dates well. The RPD found this contradiction to be significant as it was of the view that it would be reasonable for XXXX XXXX XXXX to remember if the sacrifice by the occult fraternity was a couple months after his wife's passing or a couple years and found this impugned his credibility with respect to being located and threatened.\n[25] The Appellants argue that the RPD erred in its assessment of the incidents involving sacrifices being left at the Appellants' residence. Specifically, they argue that XXXX XXXX XXXX declared at the beginning of the hearing there were two incidents and testified to this effect, with the first occurring in XXXX 2014 before his wife's death and the second in 2016. It is argued there were no contradictions in his evidence.19\n[26] I agree with the RPD finding that XXXX XXXX XXXX was inconsistent in his evidence on the sacrifices. As pointed out by the RPD, he does not mention a sacrifice in XXXX 2014 in his BOC narrative. This is significant as it occurred prior to his wife's murder and frightened them to the extent they left Lagos for Ikorodu for two months. When questioned about why he did not mention this in his BOC, XXXX XXXX XXXX did not answer the question directly and only stated that he put the second incident from XXXX 2014 after his wife was deceased.20 Further, I agree that the incident he testified to occurring in 2016 he describes in his BOC as having occurred in 2014. I do not accept that one would be off by two years in their recollection of such a significant and likely scary incident. Finally, it must be pointed out that when XXXX XXXX XXXX evidence is taken as a whole, it would indicate that there were actually three sacrifices it total: XXXX 2014, XXXX 2014, and XXXX 2016. This inherent inconsistency, along with the reasons above, lead me to conclude these events likely did not occur and undermine his credibility regarding being located by the alleged agents of persecution. As a result, it leads me to find that it is unlikely that the agents of persecution would locate the Appellants in the future.\nEvidence of Brother and Uncle Being Killed by Agents of Harm\n[27] The RPD found XXXX XXXX XXXX provided insufficient evidence to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that his brother and uncle were killed by the agents of persecution. The RPD considered XXXX XXXX XXXX testimony explaining his mother told him his brother had a confrontation with the agents of persecution about a mosque being built on land belonging to his late wife and three weeks later he was killed. Also, XXXX XXXX XXXX explained that his mother heard from a friend of his brother who was present at the murder about what happened, and this led them to believe the agents of persecution were responsible. However, the RPD noted this conversation is not mentioned in the mother's affidavit nor is there an affidavit from the friend who allegedly witnessed the murder. There is also no police report or death certificate.\n[28] In respect to his uncle's death, the RPD considered XXXX XXXX XXXX explanation for why he believed his uncle was killed for helping the Appellants to escape Nigeria and found it to be speculative, noting XXXX XXXX XXXX does not know the details of the killing and was presuming why his uncle was killed. Finally, the RPD pointed to the mother's affidavit which states the assailants had not been identified.21\n[29] The Appellants argue that the RPD erred in its treatment of XXXX XXXX XXXX evidence regarding the killings of his brother and uncle. They argue that XXXX XXXX XXXX was unable to obtain a death certificate for his brother's death as his mother was unable to complete the formalities but that she did provide details in her affidavit about what happened. Further, it is argued that the RPD ignored the evidence of XXXX XXXX XXXX regarding why he believed the agents of persecution are responsible for both of those killings.22\n[30] Having independently reviewed the record, findings and decision, I find the RPD did not err as alleged. When asked why his mother did not mention details of how she found out her son was killed from the friend, the Appellant did not provide an explanation, only reiterated that he mentioned the incident in his BOC narrative.23 I agree that it would be reasonable to expect that XXXX XXXX XXXX mother would have mentioned in her affidavit the details of how she found out how her son was killed and by who. Similarly, in my view, it would be reasonable to expect that the friend who witnessed the actual murder would provide an affidavit to that effect. The lack of these details raises questions into the Appellants' account of what transpired and who killed XXXX XXXX XXXX brother, at best amounting to his own assumptions. Further, his uncle's murder, as per XXXX XXXX XXXX own mother, was carried out by unknown people, again calling into question XXXX XXXX XXXX assertion that it was in fact the agents of harm and Muslim \"fanatics\".\n[31] Finally, in my view, it is unreasonable for the Appellant to not have provided a single piece of objective documentary evidence supporting the death and murder of his brother, uncle, and wife for that matter. He explained that no death certificates were obtained by him as it would be a traumatic experience trying to obtain a death certificate and that his mother did not obtain one after his brother's death.24 The Appellant has testified to 3 murders in his family in a span of 5 years yet has been unable to provide a single document from government officials or persons with some legal or medical authority confirming that these individuals were indeed murdered. I find that it would be reasonable for the Appellant or his family members still residing in Nigeria to obtain some objective proof of the deaths, as emotionally difficult as that process may be, as that would be a basic step for the families of these individuals, including the Appellant after losing his wife, to close off the deceased personal affairs, if for nothing else. For all these reasons, I find, as did the RPD, that the Appellants have not established, on a balance of probabilities, that XXXX XXXX XXXX brother and uncle were in fact killed by the agents of persecution.\nXXXX School Location Known Yet No Actions by Agents\n[32] The RPD points to the evidence that the agents of persecution knew where the female Appellant was for school yet after the initial attempted kidnapping made no further attempts for approximately 1.5 years to harm her. This, in the RPD's view, speaks to a lack of motivation by the agents of persecution to actually harm her given they knew her location.\n[33] The Appellants interpret this finding as the RPD stating that as long as the female Appellant is in a well protected school, she is safe from harm. They argue that she can not be expected to live in seclusion or confinement in a school for the rest of her life.\n[34] After my independent analysis, I do not find this is what the RPD concluded. I find the Appellants are attempting to impugn meaning to the finding that is simply not there. The RPD considered this evidence and found that it is indicative of the agents of harm not being motivated to actually harm the Appellants and her in particular, not that she should hide in a school. I agree with the RPD. In essence, the minor Appellant's whereabouts were known and if indeed the agents were determined to harm her, they knew where to find her yet did nothing of the sort. The finding goes to motivation of the agents, not to suggest she should stay in hiding.\n[35] In summary, the cumulative effect of the inconsistencies and the evidence that is lacking, as a whole, lead me to find that the agents of persecution are not motivated to find the Appellant. As a result, in my view, the agents of persecution would not be motivated to find and harm the Appellants in Port Harcourt, a city of several million inhabitants and some six hundred kilometers away.\nIFA - 2nd Prong Analysis\n[36] The RPD considered numerous issues raised by the Appellants, including the significant populations and multilingual and multiethnic composition of Port Harcourt and Benin City. The RPD considered the personal circumstances of the Appellants in light of the objective documentary evidence and the JG on Nigeria.25\n[37] The Appellants argue that XXXX XXXX XXXX testified to feeling unsafe in the proposed IFAs and feels pressure and constant fear. Additionally, it is argued that he does not speak the local dialect and would be unable to find housing or work and therefore unable to financially support his children. The Appellants also argue that the RPD did not consider the children's situation in terms of changing schools if relocated and the Appellants can not be expected to stay in hiding.26\n[38] I have conducted my own independent analysis of the evidence and decision and find that the RPD was correct in their findings. I note that the RPD considered all relevant aspects of relocating to the proposed IFAs in a thoughtful and thorough manner, weighing the evidence and reaching their own conclusion with the particular circumstances of the Appellants in mind. I also find it would not be unduly harsh or unreasonable for the Appellants to relocate to Port Harcourt.\n[39] English is the official language of Nigeria.27 Yoruba, which the Appellants list as their native language, is one of the other major languages utilized in Nigeria.28 The Appellants have not satisfied me that they would face language barriers in Port Harcourt given their language abilities in the official English language as well as another prominent language in Nigeria. There is no evidence that XXXX XXXX XXXX or his children would be unable to communicate in either of the two languages should they relocate to Port Harcourt, or that they would have any challenges with attending a new school. I note that the minor appellants have already moved previously, the female Appellant to the XXXX XXXX and the boys with XXXX XXXX XXXX sister in Ibidan, as well as, moving to the USA and Canada. While never easy, this would not be a new process to them.\n[40] I agree with the RPD that XXXX XXXX XXXX is a highly educated individual who has significant work experience in Nigeria. He holds a Masters degree and has worked the better part of a decade and half since 2000, including while he pursued his education.29 Having a post secondary education and above average education are factors that would assist in finding employment. However, I am mindful that the objective evidence indicates that in larger cities, as throughout Nigeria, there may be high unemployment but people can find work in industries that are in demand in cities like Port Harcourt irrespective of where they originate from in Nigeria.30\n[41] The Appellants also argue that they will face barriers, including finding accommodations. While I accept there may be some challenges in finding accommodations in a major city like Port Harcourt, I do not accept that people would refuse to rent to the Appellants when they find out that \"Muslim fanatics\" are after them. Firstly, that is not a detail the Appellants need to disclose to prospective landlords. Secondly, the Appellants identify as Christian and the documentary evidence indicates that approximately half of the population in Nigeria are Christians and the other half are Muslims, therefore they could establish themselves within the Christian community and seek their assistance in finding shelter.31 Thirdly, it must be noted that the Appellants are originally from Lagos, a heavily populated city with over 13 million inhabitants where they were able to find accommodations. In my view, if they were able to find accommodations in a city like Lagos, they could also do so in a city with over 2 million inhabitants like Port Harcourt.32 Finally, the Appellants have successfully relocated internationally, from Lagos to Riverside, California, and then again to Providence, Rhode Island, and finally to Canada, showing an ability to re-establish themselves in foreign cities and countries. Port Harcourt has an international airport,33 making travel there trouble-free, especially for those who have travelled internationally like the Appellants.\n[42] As a result, after conducting my own independent analysis, I find the Appellants have not met the very high threshold required to establish that relocation to Port Harcourt would be unreasonable or unduly harsh, in light of their personal circumstances.\nNo Real or Perceived Bias or Improper Examination by RPD\n[43] The Appellants take issue with the manner in which the RPD conducted its examination of XXXX XXXX XXXX, arguing the RPD was aggressive, had a preconceived idea on how to decide the case, and found minimalistic contradictions in the evidence.34\n[44] Having carefully listened to the audio recording from the proceeding, I find the RPD did no such thing as alleged by the Appellants. To the contrary, the RPD gave clear instructions to XXXX XXXX XXXX about answering questions and asking for a break should he need one, asked questions in a calm and straightforward manner, and asked for clarifications and explanations as the need arose. There was nothing improper in how the RPD conducted the hearing.\n[45] Now, an allegation of bias is a serious one and raises issues of natural justice and fairness. The test for bias requires a consideration of what an informed person, viewing the situation realistically and practically and having thought the matter through, would conclude about the decision makers ability to, more likely than not, decide fairly.35 The courts have been clear that the \"threshold for bias, whether real or perceived, is high. The grounds for finding a reasonable apprehension of bias must be substantial, rather than coming from the viewpoint of a 'very sensitive or scrupulous conscience'\".36\n[46] I have independently reviewed the entirety of the proceedings and find the Appellants have not met the high threshold required in establishing, on a balance of probabilities, that the RPD engaged in a real or perceived bias. To the contrary, it is clear that the RPD was knowledgeable about the allegations and evidence presented and asked relevant questions throughout the proceeding in a respectful manner. Further, the RPD considered XXXX XXXX XXXX testimony, including any explanations regarding the evidence, weighed the evidence, and reached their decision based on the evidence. In my view, an informed person viewing the case realistically and practically, having thought the matter through, would conclude that the RPD was able to and did decide the case fairly. As a result, there was no real or perceived bias.\nMinor Female Claimant and FGM\n[47] The Appellants argue that the RPD did not ask any questions of the minor female Appellant nor XXXX XXXX XXXX regarding FGM and that RPD did not consider her in the decision. It is argued she fears gender related persecution for the threats of FGM being carried out on her and that no IFA exists for her as FGM is \"near universal\".37\n[48] It must be pointed out that in fact the RPD and Counsel for the Appellants questioned XXXX XXXX XXXX about the threat of FGM against the minor female claimant.38 Perhaps more importantly, the decision of the RPD as a whole also applies to the minor female Appellant as ultimately the RPD found that the agents of persecution would not have the means and motivation to locate all of the Appellants in Port Harcourt of Benin City. This incudes, and extends to, XXXX XXXX XXXX belief that he will be killed due to his late wife's conversion and proselytization of Christianity and the minor female claimants fear of being kidnapped and circumcised by the agents of persecution. As a result, I find that the RPD did not err as alleged.\nCONCLUSION\n[49] The RAD dismisses the appeal and confirms the decision of the RPD that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection, pursuant to section 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\n(signed)\n\"Christopher Marcinkiewicz\"\nChristopher Marcinkiewicz\nMarch 10, 2020\nDate\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD File \/ Dossier de la SAR : MB9-24277\nMB9-24278 \/ MB9-24279 \/ MB9-24280\nRAD.25.02 (January, 2020)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n2\nImmigration and Refugee\nBoard of Canada\nRefugee Appeal Division\nCommission de l'immigration\net du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 du Canada\nSection d'appel des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s\nRAD.25.02 (January, 2020)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX (the appellant) is a citizen of the United States. He is appealing the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD), which rejected his refugee protection claim because no evidence was submitted to indicate that he would be subjected to a risk if he had to return to the United States.1\nSummary of relevant facts\n[2] The appellant's mother was designated as his representative. She claimed refugee status in Canada, along with the appellant and her two daughters, when she arrived from the United States. The mother and her two daughters are citizens of Haiti. All of them based their refugee protection claims on the facts described by the appellant's mother. The complaints of the appellant's mother all have to do with her experiences in Haiti. The appellant's mother has not reported anything against the United States in her written account. The refugee protection claims of the four family members were rejected by the RPD. The appeals of the mother and her two daughters were dismissed by the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) for lack of jurisdiction under subsection 110(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). In her appeal, the mother reiterated her complaints about the situations she lived through in Haiti, and alleged that the RPD member did not render a decision based on the facts reported in her Basis of Claim Form (BOC Form) and her testimony. In addition to the claim that the RPD member rendered a decision unrelated to the evidence, nothing in the mother's appeal concerns the appellant. The RPD's conclusion regarding the appellant is not challenged.\nRPD's position\n[3] The RPD determined that the appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection, because no evidence was submitted in support of the refugee protection claim. There is no subjective or objective evidence that the appellant would be at risk if he had to return to the United States.\nAppellant's position\n[4] The appellant's appeal is based on the grounds of appeal raised by his mother. The RPD's challenged conclusions have to do with the mother's allegations and the situation she lived through in Haiti. According to the mother, the RPD's decision is based on an account that is not hers and on the evidence in the record. New documents in Haiti were filed in the appeal record. The appellant is requesting the admission of the documents and an oral hearing.\nDeterminative issue before the RAD\n[5] The determinative issue before the RAD is the lack of prospective risk.\nDETERMINATION\n[6] After reviewing the RPD and RAD records and listening to the recording of the hearing about the appellant, I dismiss the appeal. The RPD's decision is correct. The appellant is neither a Convention refugee, nor a person in need of protection. The BOC Forms filed by the appellant's mother for herself and on behalf her children do not mention any allegations regarding the United States. No evidence regarding the appellant was filed with the RPD. According to the recording, the appellant's mother testified that there was no fear regarding the appellant if he were to return to the United States.\nNEW EVIDENCE\nThe evidence submitted by the appellant is rejected\n[7] Pursuant to the Act,2 I can only allow evidence:\ni. that arose after the RPD rendered its decision;\nii. that was not reasonably available at the time of the decision;\niii. that the person could not have been expected in the circumstances to have submitted to the RPD before the decision was rendered.\n[8] If the evidence meets one or more of these requirements, I must decide whether the evidence is new, credible and relevant before allowing it.3\n[9] Through his mother, the appellant filed three documents in support of his appeal. Two of those documents were provided by the Canada Border Services Agency (IMM 0008, IMM 5669, Appendix 12), the Basis of Claim Forms (BOC Forms), and Exhibit 10. All of these documents are part of the RPD record. Therefore, this is not new evidence.\n[10] Through his mother, he also filed an affidavit dated XXXX XXXX, 2020. This affidavit is admissible under subsection 110(4) of the IRPA. It is also new, credible and relevant in that it alleges that the RPD's decision is based on facts that are not set out on the BOC Form nor in the testimony. The document is labelled A-1.4\nRequest for hearing denied\n[11] The appellant is requesting a hearing. The RAD may hold a hearing if the new documents meet the three criteria set out in subsection 110(6) of the IRPA, namely that (a) they raise a serious issue with respect to credibility; b) they are central to the decision with respect to the refugee protection claim; and (c) they would justify allowing or rejecting the refugee protection claim. Since the affidavit alleges that the decision does not reflect the allegations in the BOC Form and the testimony at the hearing, it is not required to make a decision. Request for a hearing denied.\nANALYSIS\nStandard of review\n[12] My role is to review all of the evidence and establish whether the RPD's decision is correct,5 based on the grounds raised by the appellant.6\nThe RPD did not err\n[13] The RPD determined that the appellant, who is a citizen of the United States, is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the Act.7 In his BOC Form, the appellant is relying on the grounds raised by his mother to claim refugee protection. The written account in his mother's BOC Form does not mention any risks for the appellant in the United States. On the last hearing date, October 22, 2019,8 the appellant's mother stated the following, after she was asked whether the appellant had fears for his safety if he had to return to the United States: [translation] \"No, not in the United States.\" This statement contradicts the submission in the affidavit,9 namely that the RPD did not render its decision based on the allegations and the testimony, at least with regard to the appellant.\n[14] Given the lack of allegations in the BOC Form, the mother's statement at the hearing on October 22, 2019, which confirms that the RPD did make a decision with regard to the appellant based on the evidence before it, and the absence of any challenge with regard to the appellant in the appeal memorandum, the RPD's conclusion is correct.\n[15] The appellant was unable to demonstrate a serious possibility of persecution in terms of the Convention or that, on a balance of probabilities, he would personally face torture, risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, if returned to the United States.\nCONCLUSION\n[16] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the RPD's determination that the appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nCharles Gauthier\nCharles Gauthier\nFebruary 24, 2021\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD File No. \/ No de dossier de la SAR : TB9-35392\nRAD.25.02 (January 2020)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n6\nImmigration and Refugee\nBoard of Canada\nRefugee Appeal Division\nCommission de l'immigration et du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 du Canada\nSection d'appel des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s\nRAD.25.02 (January 2020)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] I allow this appeal. I substitute my own decision that the Appellants are Convention refugees. XXXX XXXX XXXX (Principal Appellant) and XXXX XXXX XXXX (Associate Appellant) are citizens of Dominica. They appeal a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD), which rejected their claim for refugee protection. The Appellants fear the public and the police, after the Principal Appellant's former colleague revealed her same-sex relationship to police, her parents, and her common-law partner, who is the father of the Associate Appellant. The Appellants allege that if they must return to Dominica, they will be subject to humiliation, ridicule, discrimination, and violence because the Principal Appellant is a bisexual woman.\n[2] The determinative issue in this appeal is whether the RPD erred in assessing the Principal Appellant's credibility with respect to her sexual orientation.\n[3] The RPD found that her testimony was vague and incoherent in parts, and that photographs at a pride parade could not prove that she was bisexual. The RPD found it unlikely that her former colleague would wait more than three years to seek revenge on the Principal Appellant, or that the police would investigate that person's allegations based on evidence that was weak and stale. Moreover, the RPD found it unreasonable that the Principal Appellant had failed to obtain a letter of support from her same-sex partner of many years, or to seek services within the LGBTIQ+1 community in Canada until two and a half years after her arrival. The RPD accepted the psychological assessment that the Principal Appellant suffers from XXXX XXXX XXXX but noted that the psychologist was not in a position to say whether her story was true and was the cause of the psychological problems. Finally, the RPD found that the Associate Appellant's claim was unsupported by the evidence about his father's behaviour or conditions in Dominica.\n[4] The Appellants submit that key findings of the RPD were speculative and failed to consider the Principal Appellant's explanations. They argue that:\n* The RPD's finding about the delay for the former colleague to make threats and contact the police was an unwarranted negative inference that was predicated on speculation.\n* The RPD speculated about the priorities of the Dominica police and whether they would investigate the incident reported by the Principal Appellant's former colleague.\n* It was unreasonable for the RPD to expect an affidavit or more official document from the police officer who texted the appellant, as that was a discreet and unofficial disclosure.\n* The RPD's negative finding about not having a support letter from her former same-sex lover is hypothetical, speculative and does not consider the appellant's explanation that her role as a pastor precludes her from associating with the Principal Appellant.\n* The date the appellant joined Centre 519 is not indicative of her sexual orientation.\n* The appellant's fear of her common-law partner denying her custody of their son if returned to Dominica is not lessened because he visited the son in Canada.\n[5] Having made an independent assessment of the evidence, I agree with the Appellants. I find that the RPD made errors in its assessment of the Appellants' credibility and failed to deliver reasons that implement the SOGIE Guideline.2\nDECISION\n[6] The appeal is allowed. I substitute my own decision that the Appellants are Convention refugees.\nANALYSIS\nThe role of the RAD in this appeal is to decide whether the RPD was correct\n[7] The standard of review for an RPD decision that is before the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) is correctness unless an exception applies.3 I find that no exception applies in this matter.\nThe Principal Appellant gave credible evidence about her sexual orientation\n[8] I find that the RPD was wrong to conclude that the Principal Appellant was not a bisexual woman based on its assessment that her testimony was vague and incoherent in parts, implausible, and lacking satisfactory corroboration.\n[9] The RPD made an erroneous finding of fact without regard to all the evidence before it. I give substantial weight to the Principal Appellant's testimony and to the corroboration from her family, and I find on a balance of probabilities that the Principal Appellant is a bisexual woman.\n[10] The Principal Appellant testified that she had been attracted to her same-sex partner when they were childhood friends, and that this friendship became an intimate relationship while they were teenagers. The relationship was secret. They paused as changes in their lives required and resumed when they had the opportunity. I found the Principal Appellant's testimony about her love for her same-sex partner to be clear and direct, and their behaviour to be consistent with the independent evidence about their need to avoid homophobia in Dominica. This aspect of the Principal Appellant's testimony was neither vague nor incoherent.\n[11] In addition, she provided several items of corroborative correspondence, including from:\n* her mother, who explained her disappointment and the negative repercussions for their family of the disclosure of her sexual orientation;4 and\n* her son's father, whose violent and vituperative texts show not only his feelings of betrayal and humiliation, but also the fundamental homophobia of society in Dominica.5\nThe RPD did not show that it had weighed this probative supporting evidence, which contradicted its conclusion that the Principal Appellant is not a bisexual woman. In failing to mention the texts and the letter from the Principal Appellant's mother and male partner, the RPD erred.6\n[12] Moreover, the RPD failed to follow the SOGIE Guideline when it based its conclusion, in part, on the observation that the Principal Appellant did not seek services within the LGBTIQ+ community in Canada until two and a half years after her arrival. The RPD did not provide a full analysis of her explanations that she was prioritizing care of her son, the services were distant from her home, and she did not know of these services until they were pointed out by her Counsel and the Designated Representative. Without such analysis, it appears that the RPD's finding is based on an inappropriate assumption that people with diverse SOGIE should participate in LGBTIQ+ culture and organizations in Canada.7\nThe RPD wrongly impugned the Principal Appellant's credibility\n[13] I find that the RPD wrongly impugned the Principal Appellant's credibility about her sexual orientation based on three erroneous plausibility findings.\nIt was plausible that the same-sex partner did not want to implicate herself\n[14] The RPD disregarded both the SOGIE Guideline and the rules on plausibility findings when it found it unreasonable the Principal Appellant's failure to obtain a letter of support from her same-sex partner of many years. The RPD was incorrect.\n[15] The Appellants argue that the RPD's negative finding is hypothetical, speculative and does not consider the Principal Appellant's explanation that the same-sex partner's role as a pastor precludes her from associating with the Principal Appellant.\n[16] I agree with the Appellants. I find that the RPD finding is a veiled and speculative plausibility finding. The SOGIE Guideline contains two pertinent cautions:\n* An individual's testimony may be the only evidence of their SOGIE where corroborative evidence is not reasonably available;8 and\n* Many individuals with diverse SOGIE conceal their SOGIE out of mistrust or fear of repercussion by state and non-state actors, which may make them reluctant to discuss their SOGIE with a decision-maker.9\n[17] The essence of the RPD finding is that if the Principal Appellant had really been in a loving long-term relationship, then her same-sex partner would make the sacrifice of further exposing herself to persecution, to support the Appellants. I disagree. I find it both plausible and reasonable that a person in the position of the Principal Appellant's same-sex partner would fear the consequences of putting her name to an admission of her diverse SOGIE. In my view, the events could and did \"happen as described.\"10\nIt was plausible that the former colleague waited to exact revenge\n[18] The RPD was wrong to find it unlikely that the Principal Appellant's former colleague would wait more than three years to seek revenge.\n[19] The Appellants submit that the RPD finding about the former colleague's delay to make threats and contact the police was an unwarranted negative inference that was predicated on speculation.\n[20] I agree with the Appellants. I find that the RPD finding is a veiled and speculative plausibility finding. The RPD disregarded evidence that contradicted its conclusion. For example, the former colleague methodically destroyed the reputations of several co-workers in the years that followed her dismissal. In addition, the Principal Appellant explained an interaction where she may have slighted the former colleague.\n[21] The Principal Appellant testified that a childhood acquaintance happened across her engaged in intimacy with her same-sex partner in a hotel washroom in August 2013.11 At the time, the couple was on friendly terms with the acquaintance-who was a colleague at the Principal Appellant's workplace-and they convinced her to keep their secret. However, the colleague subsequently committed fraud at the workplace and was fired. The fraud investigation is substantiated by correspondence between the Principal Appellant and a human resources representative.12 Since the Principal Appellant gave information in the investigation that proved her own innocence but rightly incriminated the colleague, the colleague vowed revenge against the Principal Appellant, among others.\n[22] Indeed, this former colleague damaged the reputations of several co-workers.13 She did not act on the threat against the Principal Appellant until October 2018. At that time, the former colleague threatened her in a text message. I find on a balance of probabilities that the former colleague carried out her threat to expose the Principal Appellant's sexual orientation to the police, her parents and her male common-law partner, father of the Associate Appellant. In my view, the events could and did happen as described. The logical counter to the RPD reasoning is the adage that \"revenge is a dish best served cold.\"\nIt was plausible that the police might investigate the Principal Appellant\n[23] The RPD was wrong to find it unlikely that the police would investigate the former colleague's allegations, which were based on evidence that was more than three years old.\n[24] The Appellants argue that the RPD speculated about the priorities of the Dominica police and whether they would investigate the incident reported by the Principal Appellant's former colleague. They submit that it was unreasonable for the RPD to expect an affidavit or more official document from the police officer who texted the appellant,14 because that was a discreet and unofficial disclosure.\n[25] I agree with the Appellants. The Principal Appellant testified that she was acquainted with several police officers because they rode along with her on duties related to her work. In this circumstance, it is plausible that one might contact her informally upon hearing the allegations of the former colleague.\n[26] Same-sex sexual activity is criminal in Dominica and the government has said these laws will remain valid.15 Moreover, in 2013 the Prime Minister highlighted the homophobic character of the laws by likening any repeal of same-sex activity to repealing the law on incest.16 The RPD failed to give proper weight to probative evidence that contradicts its conclusion with respect to a police investigation, including:\n* independent documentary evidence that authorities in Dominica prosecuted a gay couple from the United States of America for \"buggery\" and indecent exposure in March 2012;17 and\n* consistent reports of arrests for \"buggery\" from 1995 to 2010, although the data is not disaggregated to show whether the arrests were for same-sex activity, and no one went to jail.18\n[27] Having made an independent assessment, I find on a balance of probabilities that the Dominica Police Force expressed an interest in the allegations against the Principal Appellant related to her sexual orientation. As such, I find her credibility is not impugned by her evidence about contact from the police.\n[28] I do agree with the RPD that the Principal Appellant's evidence about the alleged investigation is general and insufficient to prove that the police pursued it seriously. While she mentioned that someone visited her parents' home, she was unable to say whether it was a police officer. The Principal Appellant testified that to her knowledge the police did not issue a summons for her. In my view this deficiency of evidence relates more to the objective basis for the claim, rather than to credibility.\nThe Principal Appellant has shown that she is perceived to be bisexual in Dominica\n[29] I find it more likely than not that the Principal Appellant is a bisexual woman, and that she is perceived as a bisexual woman in her home country of Dominica. There was an exchange at the RPD hearing that shone as simply sincere. The RPD asked whether the Principal Appellant had tried to get corroboration from former co-workers who had phoned her in the wake of their colleague's disclosure of her sexual orientation. She answered no. When the RPD asked why not, the Principal Appellant said, \"I didn't want to.\" When the RPD asked again why not, she replied, \"Because they were just acting out of curiosity. It wasn't genuine concern.\"19 The corroborative messages from her family and former co-workers attest to the fact that the gossip about her sexual orientation made its way through her community in Dominica and beyond.\nThe Appellants are at risk of harm in Dominica\nThe Appellants may be harmed by the public or the police\n[30] I find that both Appellants are at risk of harm in Dominica. I find there is more than a mere possibility that each would suffer physical violence from members of the public connected to the Principal Appellant's identity as a bisexual woman.20 In addition, I find that the Principal Appellant faces more than a mere possibility of harassment or mistreatment by police because of her sexual orientation. Furthermore, I find that the Appellants face a serious possibility of discrimination amounting to persecution--known in law as \"cumulative grounds\"21- if they must return to Dominica.\n[31] In a 2010 hate crime, Clement James was murdered after being accused of \"watching\" his murderer, who had expressed violent homophobic views.22 A 2015 Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) report on violence against LGBTIQ+ persons states that local courts in Dominica have accepted the \"gay panic\" defence: the attempt to justify killing the victim, alleging that they provoked the violence by making same-sex sexual advances.23 As remarked above, the lack of full criminal prosecutions of people with diverse SOGIE does not indicate that they are left in peace. From the openly homophobic remarks of political leaders and the arrest numbers between 1995 and 2010, I infer that the Principal Appellant-who was known to the police in a professional capacity-faces a serious possibility of police harassment related to her sexual orientation in the future. While the Dominica police force is reputed to operate professionally and there have been few complaints of violations in recent years, five officers were charged with murder in 2015 for the death of a detainee.24 The SOGIE Guideline posits that even if laws criminalizing same-sex behaviours are not enforced, \"their existence may create a climate of impunity for perpetrators of violence and contribute to societal discrimination...\" and threats.25\n[32] Bisexual people may face risks of mistreatment like those faced by gay men or lesbians, in addition to specific types of discrimination or harassment.26 The law in Dominica does not prohibit sexual harassment or discrimination against a person based on sexual orientation. Civil society reports \"a pervasive problem\" of sexual harassment and that strong societal and employment discrimination against persons due to their real or perceived sexual orientation is \"common.\" Moreover, LGBTIQ+ \"victims of violence or harassment avoided notifying police of abuse\" in Dominica because of social stigma. \"Stigma and fear of abuse and intimidation\" prevented LGBTIQ+ organizations in the country from developing their membership or carrying out public activities such as Pride marches.27 This documentary evidence is consistent with the caution in the SOGIE Guideline that country condition information may be scarce or incomplete due to underreporting caused by fear and stigma.28\n[33] In the deeply homophobic society of Dominica, I find the Associate Appellant is at particular risk due to the intersection29 between his youth, and his family connection to-as well as his emotional, physical, and financial dependence on-his mother. I infer that as he grows up, there is a serious possibility he will face humiliation, ridicule, and discrimination in the realms of education and his daily social interactions, compounded by his mother's experience of the same in employment and housing, all because the Principal Appellant is a bisexual woman. I find that the Appellants' vulnerability is heightened by her mental health status. The RPD accepted the psychological assessment that the Principal Appellant suffers from XXXX XXXX XXXX. In a Saint Lucia case with some parallels-e.g. documentary evidence that it is an overtly homophobic society in the Caribbean-the Federal Court found the Immigration and Refugee Board erred in failing to treat the minor applicant's claim that he would be taunted and abused at school independently from his mother's unsuccessful claim that she was a person of diverse SOGIE.30\nThe evidence does not prove the Associate Appellant's father may harm the Appellants\n[34] I find that the evidence is insufficient to substantiate a prospective threat to either Appellant from the Associate Appellant's father. The evidence shows that he was furious with the Principal Appellant immediately after he learned of her sexual orientation. However, he has cooperated with the Principal Appellant in the best interests of the child subsequently.\n[35] The RPD found that the Associate Appellant's claim was unsupported by the evidence about his father's behaviour or conditions in Dominica.\n[36] The Appellants argue that the Principal Appellant's fear of her common-law partner denying her custody of their son if returned to Dominica is not lessened because he visited the son in Canada.\n[37] While I believe that the Principal Appellant feared her male partner at one time, and I believe that she fears losing custody of her son, I find there is not enough evidence that the Associate Appellant's father would instigate custody proceedings founded on her sexual orientation or otherwise behave as an agent of persecution in the future.\n[38]\nThe Appellants are Convention refugees\n[39] The Appellants have a well-founded fear of persecution due to their membership in a particular social group: bisexual women and their family members. Since the national police is a potential agent of persecution, there is no adequate state protection nor any safe and reasonable internal flight alternative for the Appellants in Dominica.31\nCONCLUSION\n[40] The appeal is allowed. I substitute my own decision that the Appellants are Convention refugees.\n(signed)\nChristina Harrison Baird\nChristina Harrison Baird\nApril 18, 2021\nDate\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD File \/ Dossier de la SAR : TC0-00612\nTC0-00613\nRAD.25.02 (January, 2020)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n2\nImmigration and Refugee\nBoard of Canada\nRefugee Appeal Division\nCommission de l'immigration\net du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 du Canada\nSection d'appel des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s\nRAD.25.02 (January, 2020)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n",

The Notice of Appeal was received by the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) on August 3, 2015. He is reputed to have received the reasons of the RPD on July 21, 2015.\n[2] Section 159.91(1) of the amended Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations provides that the time limit for a person or the Minister to file an appeal is fifteen days after the day on which the RPD's reasons are reputed to be received, while the time limit to perfect an appeal is thirty days after the receipt of those reasons. As such, the appellant's appeal was to be perfected on or before August 20, 2015.\n[3] The Appellant has filed an Application for an Extension of Time to Perfect an Appeal and his Appellant's record, which were received by the RAD on August 26, 2015, six days late. On the Application for an Extension of Time to Perfect an Appeal accompanying the Application, the Appellant's counsel explains that the Appellant's record was late because he was on vacation in early August, and following his vacation, moved his office space.\n[4] The Appellant asks that, for reasons of fairness and natural justice, his application be allowed and the requested extension of time granted.\n[5] The Minister has not responded to this Application.\nDETERMINATION OF THE APPLICATION\n[6] The RAD accepts the application for an extension of time to perfect this appeal.\nApplication for Extension of Time\n[7] Section 159.91(2) of the Regulations states:\n\"If the appeal cannot be filed within the time limit set out in paragraph 1(a) or perfected within the time limit set out in paragraph (1)(b), the Refugee Appeal Division may, for reasons of fairness and natural justice, extend each of those time limits by the number of days that is necessary in the circumstances.\"\n[8] This provision contains three requirements. First, it must not be possible for an appeal to be filed and perfected within the time limits set out. Under this element, the Appellants must provide an explanation for the delay and must show a continuing intention to appeal during the delay. RAD Rule 37(4) requires the evidence to be in the form of an affidavit or statutory declaration. Second, any extension must be only for the number of days necessary in the circumstances. This requirement suggests that the delay should be as short as possible or, in other words, that every day of delay should be justified. The reference to \"circumstances\" implies an individualized assessment of the circumstances in each particular request for an extension of time. Third, any extension must be for reasons of fairness and natural justice. Jurisprudence has established four factors to be considered in applications for extension of time before courts or administrative tribunals: 1\n(a) there was and is a continuing intention on the part of the party presenting the motion to pursue the appeal;\n(b) the subject matter of the appeal discloses an arguable case;\n(c) there is a reasonable explanation for the defaulting parties delay and\n(d) there is no prejudice to the other party in allowing the extension.\n[9] These factors are not exhaustive, and other factors may be considered, such as, for example, the complexity of an appeal, a factor mentioned in RAD Rule 6(7). All of the factors do not have to be met. The appropriate weight must be assigned to each factor in the context of a particular case. The four factors are to be applied to determine whether fairness and natural justice in the circumstances require an extension of time for a particular number of days.\n[10] In this case, the Appellant filed his perfected Appeal six days late; the record shows that the Appellant had a continuing intention to appeal and was waiting for his counsel to be re-settled in his new office; the subject matter discloses an arguable case; the explanation of moving an office is a reasonable explanation and the Minister has not objected. The file is declared complete as of the date of this decision.\nDiane Sokolyk\nMe Diane Sokolyk\nSeptember 16, 2015\nDate\n\/dlg\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD.25.02 (2014.09.11)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\nRAD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SAR : MB5-03341\n2\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (hereinafter \"the Appellant\") made a refugee claim against his native Venezuela based on his involvement in anti-government protests. He appeals the rejection of his claim by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD). He does not submit new evidence on appeal, nor does he request that the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) hold an oral hearing. Rather, the Appellant asks the RAD to substitute a positive determination.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] For the reasons that follow, the RAD agrees with the Appellant that the RPD took too narrow a view of political persecution in Venezuela. The RPD's decision is set aside, and the RAD allows the appeal, substituting a positive decision, pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\nBACKGROUND\n[3] The following allegations are summarized in the principal Appellant's Basis of Claim form (BOC)2 and in his oral testimony. The Appellant is a citizen of Venezuela who opposes the current government. He has joined various opposition parties, but left Venezuela when he faced threats for his involvement in anti-government protests as a first aid volunteer. After he came to Canada in August 2014 as a student, the Appellant's mother continued to receive calls searching for him. When he discovered, in November 2016, that he was still being sought, the Appellant made a refugee claim. The RPD rejected his claim, finding that he did not have a sufficient political profile to warrant protection.\nISSUES ON APPEAL\n[4] The Appellant advances only one argument in support of his appeal: did the RPD err in determining that the claimant lacks a sufficient political profile?\n[5] Having reviewed the record, the RAD finds that there are two distinct analyses necessary to answer this question - that of the Appellant's personal circumstances, and the application of those circumstances to the objective documentation. For the reasons that follow, the RAD finds that the RPD committed two errors: the RPD erred in characterizing the Appellant's political profile and the RPD only selectively reviewed the objective documentation.\nROLE OF THE RAD\n[6] As held by the Federal Court of Appeal in Huruglica,3 the RAD reviews decisions of the RPD on a standard of correctness on questions of law, fact, and mixed fact and law, after conducting an independent assessment of the evidence before it. The exception to this rule is where the RPD enjoys a meaningful advantage in the assessment and weighing of oral testimony heard, which, in particular cases may attract a standard of review of reasonableness.4 Unless otherwise stated, a correctness standard has been applied.\nANALYSIS\n[7] The determinative issue in this appeal is whether or not the Appellant faces a serious possibility of persecution in Venezuela by reason of his political opinion, either actual or imputed by the state. The RAD, as will be addressed, finds that he does.\nThe RPD erred in its characterization of the Appellant's political profile\n[8] The RPD found that the Appellant did not have a sufficient political profile to be of interest to Venezuelan authorities. In reaching this conclusion, the RPD relied on the claimant's evidence that he did not think of himself as an activist, played relatively minor roles in opposition party politics, and is also a member of the ruling party. In considering the Appellant's involvement as a volunteer medic in the 2014 student protests, and the threats he subsequently received, the RPD found that these occurred more than two years ago and there was no indication that the Appellant was still being sought after.\n[9] The Appellant argues that his involvement in the 2014 protests as a medic is perceived to be a political act, and that this is sufficient to ground his claim. The RAD notes that the Appellant does not make arguments on the forward-facing nature of this risk.\n[10] Nevertheless, the RAD notes that the RPD made no negative credibility findings. While there is scarce evidence on record, a claimant before the RPD is presumed to be truthful, and the RPD accepted the Appellant's evidence. No clear error arising from the record, the RAD sees no reason to find otherwise.\n[11] Therefore, the following facts are accepted:\na. The Appellant first began political involvement encouraging young people to vote, without advocating for a specific political party.5\nb. The Appellant has historically been a member of two opposition parties, Acci\u00f3n Democr\u00e1tica and Comit\u00e9 de Organizaci\u00f3n Pol\u00edtica Electoral Independiente (COPEI), and assisted in rallies and providing technical support to protests.6 During one protest he attended with the Mesa de la Unidad party, he was mistreated by police;7\nc. While the Appellant was, as the RPD noted, a member of the ruling party, he sought to remove his name from their registry twice - on the second occasion, he was removed from the building with violence.8\nd. In 2014, the Appellant attended various protests against the government as a volunteer medic. Though the first aid provided began as non-partisan, medics came to be perceived by the government as allies of the protesters. The Appellant was beaten by the National Guard on one occasion in February 2014.9\ne. In April 2014, the Appellant and his mother were stuck in traffic when they were robbed by masked men.10 The men referenced the Appellant's desire to \"help others\" and called him by name - he took this to be a reference to his role in the protests.11\nf. In August 2015, the Appellant's mother was threatened with death if she did not reveal the Appellant's whereabouts;12\ng. After the Appellant left Venezuela in August 2014, his mother received telephone calls from unidentified persons asking when he would be home. These calls continued until at least November 2016.13\nh. Other members of the Appellant's family also have political profiles, though he does not believe his problems are related to theirs.14 His father, in his previous responsibilities, ordered the arrest of the current president, and has suffered repercussions. The Appellant's sister, a lawyer who challenged a government action, also suffered retaliation.\n[12] The RAD notes that the Appellant spoke passionately and knowledgeably about politics in Venezuela. He has demonstrated a history of opposition to the current ruling party: demanding to be removed from their membership, participating as a protester, joining opposition parties, and also having been identified as providing first aid to anti-government protesters. He was specifically threatened after this incident, and unknown persons were seeking his whereabouts as recently as November 2016. Moreover, while the Appellant did not state that he had faced persecution because of his relation to his father and sister, the RAD notes that his profile may be augmented as a result of the family's common opposition to the current government.\n[13] Therefore, the RAD finds that the RPD failed to assess the totality of the Appellant's personal circumstances. The RPD also found that the Appellant had not been specifically threatened since August 2015 - the accepted evidence, however, is that he was being sought as of November 2016. The RAD has considered all of the above accepted facts in assessing the objective country documentation below.\nThe RPD conducted a selective assessment of the objective documentation\n[14] In reaching its conclusion, the RPD cited examples of a medical doctor, an engineer, and a business man who were detained by Venezuelan state forces after criticizing the government in public media. The RPD concluded that the fact that this report mentioned \"dozens\" of Venezuelans being threatened by the government, in contrast to the number of political opponents in Venezuela, meant that only those with significant political profiles were targeted.15\n[15] The Appellant argues that this is too selective a reading of country documentation. The RAD agrees.\n[16] The Appellant cites a report which indicates that among the thousands arrested during the 2014 protests were those seen as simply associated with protests in some way, on little to no evidence to support the charges laid:\nMore recently there have been selective detentions. These detentions are of people who have allegedly been seen or caught by intelligence agencies, or by \"patriotic informants,\" (patriotas cooperantes) not just protesting, but also supplying food, water or some kind of assistance to the protesters in the streets.16\n[17] The same report indicates that any association with protests, such as even being employed as a watchman for a property where protesters slept, may lead to arrest.17 Of those arrested, some were held without charge, some faced reportedly politically-motivated criminal prosecution, and others were monitored or had their freedom curtailed by state forces.18\n[18] Information before the RPD indicated, contrary to its findings, that \"the government prosecuted dozens of lesser-known opponents for criticizing the government.\"19 [emphasis added]\n[19] The RAD has considered the newest country information, released in a new National Documentation package. In addition to the sources cited by the Appellant, the RAD notes that a lawyer was arrested for helping protesters during the 2014 protests on the basis of anonymous informants.20 One NGO reported \"5,853 cases of arbitrary detention between February 2014 and June 2016.\"21 Those arbitrarily arrested also suffered breaches of due process and physical abuse while in custody.22 A 2017 report indicates that \"the government used the judiciary to intimidate and selectively prosecute individuals critical of government policies or actions,\" with \"more than 100 political prisoners remained incarcerated as of November [2016]\" and \"[a]n additional 1,998 individuals were subject to either restricted movement or precautionary measures.\"23 State forces conducted raids for alleged criminals, which frequently ended with the death of a suspect; extra-judicial killings were reportedly on the rise.24 Political opponents of the state are reported to face unfair trials or imprisonment.25\n[20] Political dissent is severely restricted in Venezuela. In the last year, intelligence agencies, which lack independent oversight and interfere with various forms of private correspondence, \"conducted surveillance for political purposes\"26 and \"[c]ourts relied on evidence obtained from anonymous \"patriotas cooperantes\" (cooperating patriots) to persecute perceived opponents of the government.\"27 Excessive use of force against those who demonstrate opposition to the current government is common.28\n[21] Speaking out against the president may amount to a criminal act: \"The law makes insulting the president punishable by six to 30 months in prison without bail, with lesser penalties for insulting lower-ranking officials.\"29 Any form of opposition appears to be monitored - those who signed a recall referendum or who voted for the opposition were reportedly dismissed from state employment and, given the socialist nature of Venezuela, this constitutes a majority of the employment sector.30\n[22] There is also evidence of cooperation between the government and armed pro-government gangs, known as colectivos, who act to \"act to intimidate the population to discourage them from doing anything the government would dislike.\"31 The RAD notes that there is evidence that not all colectivos have engaged in violent behaviour.32 For the purposes of this decision, use of the term colectivos denotes armed pro-government gangs or paramilitary groups who have engaged in violent behaviour. The International Commission of Jurists reported in 2015 that colectivos attack and threaten anyone showing non-conformance with the socialist model.33\n[23] The panel finds that, based upon a review of the objective documentation, actual or perceived opposition to the ruling party in Venezuela may result in threats or violent retaliation amounting to persecution. In the Appellant's case, he has a history of opposition to the government, and was identified as being involved in the 2014 protests. He was being sought as recently as November 2016, and comes from a family of known government opponents. Given the Appellant's history and his passionate testimony about the state of Venezuela, the RAD does not find it to be reasonable to expect him to return and keep all opinions to himself.\n[24] The Appellant must only make out more than a mere possibility of persecution in order to succeed in his claim for refugee protection. This is a low threshold. The RAD finds that .the possibility that the Appellant will face persecution by reason of his political opinion to be more than a mere one.\nNeither state protection nor internal flight alternative is available to the Appellant\n[25] Having found that the Appellant faces more than a mere possibility of persecution by the Venezuelan state for his political opinion, the RAD similarly concludes on the basis of the above-noted objective documentation that neither adequate state protection nor a viable internal flight alternative are available to him.\nCONCLUSION\n[26] For the reasons above, the RAD finds that the RPD erred in its assessment of the possibility that the Appellant will face political persecution should he return to Venezuela. Therefore, the RAD sets aside the RPD's decision and substitutes a positive determination. The RAD finds the principal Appellant to be a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA.\n(signed)\n\"Laura Brittain\"\nLaura Brittain\nDecember 20, 2017\nDate\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n8\nRAD.25.02 (September 11, 2014)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\nRAD File \/ Dossier de la SAR : TB7-09422\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] XXXX XXXX (Appellant), citizen of Nigeria, is appealing the negative decision rendered in her case by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) on January 6, 2020.\n[2] The determinative issue for the RPD was the credibility of the Appellant. The RPD found that the Appellant was not credible in her allegations of being forced to marry an elderly man with multiple wives who would target her if she were to return to Nigeria.\n[3] The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in its findings, because it put too much emphasis on inconsistencies between her written narrative and her testimony, as well as focusing on minor problems in her exhibits, and incorrectly applied the Guideline 4 regarding women who fear gender-based violence.\n[4] I find that the RPD did not err in its finding that the Appellant was not credible. The problems raised by the RPD regarding inconsistencies and contradictions between the written and oral testimony, as well as in the exhibits, cumulatively outweighed the consistent elements of proof by the Appellant.\nDECISION\n[5] The appeal is dismissed. I confirm the RPD decision that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee under s 96 nor a person in need of protection under s 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[6] The Appellant submitted no new evidence.\nROLE OF THE RAD\n[7] When reviewing the RPD decision, I independently assessed the evidence, including listening to the recording and reading the transcript of the RPD hearing of November 21, 2019, to determine whether or not the RPD was correct in relation to each alleged error of law, of fact, or of mixed law and fact.\nRPD's Determinative Issue: Credibility\n[8] The RPD found that the Appellant was not credible in her allegations that her father had arranged for her to marry an elderly man with multiple wives, who had then arranged to have her abducted and assaulted, and threatened to kill her after discovering that she had a boyfriend while she was in the U.S. on a student visa.\nDate of Abduction\n[9] The RPD found that the Appellant's credibility was undermined by contradictions regarding the date of her alleged abduction by her intended husband: in her BOC narrative, she had indicated that the abduction and assault took place in September 2015; during her testimony, she said that this had taken place in April 2015. When asked to explain, the Appellant testified that the abduction had taken place in April 2015, but that it was in September 2015 that she had gone to the intended husband and agreed to eventually marry him if he would pay for her education in the U.S. The RPD found that this was not a reasonable explanation for the contradiction.\n[10] The Appellant argues that she may have been confused about the date, but she had been consistent in her testimony and written narrative, that she had been abducted and assaulted for three days by her intended husband, who she had consistently indicated was a 68-year-old man with five wives. The Appellant also argues that under the Guideline 4, she should be given the benefit of the doubt regarding any discrepancies with dates.\n[11] The Appellant indicates in her written narrative that she had run away from home and had been living with friends since March 2015, but that the intended husband would always discover where she had been hiding, culminating with her abduction from a friend's house in September 2015.1 This version indicates that there was a long duration of time during which she had stayed at different places that kept being discovered by the alleged agent of persecution, until finally six months later, the Appellant was abducted.\n[12] In her testimony during the RPD hearing, the Appellant testified that she was kidnapped in April 2015, after having stayed at a friend's house for a few weeks in March 2015. In this version, she was only at one friend's house for a few weeks, before being found and abducted by the alleged agent of persecution.\n[13] The Guideline 4 indicates that: \"Women refugee claimants who have suffered sexual violence may exhibit a pattern of symptoms referred to as Rape Trauma Syndrome\".2 The Guideline goes on to identify symptoms of this syndrome as including difficulty in concentrating and memory loss.3\n[14] I find that it is one thing to impugn a woman's credibility for mistaking one particular date with another, for example a Monday vs. a Tuesday, once she has established on the balance of probabilities that she has been the victim of a sexual assault. However, it is quite another, as in this case, to impugn the credibility that involves a different series of events in one version as compared to another. Here, the contradiction is not just a date, it lies in the allegations about what happened between one event and another: in the one version, she stayed at different people's homes over a six-month period in hiding from the alleged agent of persecution, who kept finding her and then abducted her; in the other version, she stayed at the home of one friend for several weeks, after which she was found and abducted.\n[15] I consider that the two versions are irreconcilable, and that the Appellant has not provided a satisfactory explanation for the difference between the two, in addition to not establishing on the balance of probabilities that the assault took place. I find that even with a consideration of the Guideline 4, the credibility of the Appellant is undermined and that the RPD did not err.\nAffidavit by Mother and by a Friend of the Appellant\n[16] The RPD found that the credibility of the Appellant was negatively affected by problems in the two affidavits produced as evidence: one by the Appellant's mother and one by her friend.4 The problem found by the RPD in the mother's affidavit is that it indicates that the Appellant had lived with her intended husband, as opposed to having been abducted for a few days, as in the written and oral testimony of the Appellant. The RPD also found it problematic that both the mother's and friend's affidavits contained a spelling mistake in the last name of the Appellant, were not contemporaneous to when the alleged events had occurred in 2015, having been signed in November 2019, and did not contain any specific dates in the information provided.\n[17] The Appellant argues that the problems raised in the affidavits are minor, such that the spelling error of the last name was likely due to a clerical error by the same person who prepared both affidavits on the same day, and that the Appellant had offered a reasonable explanation at the hearing in this regard. The Appellant argues that the mother had perhaps used a poor choice of words in her affidavit but had substantiated the main allegations, as did the friend in her affidavit, of a forced marriage to a 68-year-old man with five wives who had sexually assaulted the Appellant.\n[18] I agree that the spelling mistake in the last name of the Appellant in both affidavits is minor and should not be used to impugn the credibility of the Appellant. However, I find that what the Appellant argues was an unfortunate choice of words by the mother in her affidavit is actually a substantially different version of events than those alleged by the Appellant. It is one thing to say that a person has been abducted for three days and another to say that they moved in with someone. The exact words used in the mother's affidavit were \"...my daughter had no choice [but] to move in with...\"5 the intended husband. As the Appellant testified that she had told her mother about having been abducted6, her explanation at the hearing regarding the difference in her mother's affidavit due to stress is not satisfactory:\nMEMBER: Now you have mentioned ... sorry, you provided an affidavit from your mother who talks a bit about what she saw regarding your experiences. And your mother she states that you moved in with the XXXX. I will read the sentence exactly. \"... that my daughter had no choice than to move in with the XXXX\". Can you explain why ... why she would say that you moved in with him?\nCLAIMANT: She was passing through stress in that period so she did not know.7\n[19] I find that the date when both affidavits were signed, in November 2019, although not contemporaneous to the alleged incidents, does not lower their probative value. However, I agree with the RPD that the omission of dates to situate the allegations in both affidavits lowers their probative value, leaves the information quite vague and outweighs the general information that is provided.\n[20] When looking at the evidence as a whole, and weighing the fact that the dates of the alleged abduction were missing, as well as the contradiction by the Appellant's mother in referring to the incident as the Appellant having moved in rather than being abducted, I therefore find that the RPD did not err in finding that the credibility of the Appellant was undermined by the problems in the affidavits.\nCommunication with Intended Husband while in the U.S.\n[21] The RPD found that the credibility of the Appellant was undermined by inconsistencies between her testimony and interview notes at the port of entry: in her testimony at the hearing, she had indicated that she had spoken to her intended husband by phone in November 2016 and he had begun to have second thoughts about her studying abroad, which is why she could not get him to pay for her flight to Iowa. In the interview notes, she had indicated that she had been unable to get in touch with him and so she could not get him to pay for her flight to Iowa. When asked to explain at the hearing, the Appellant testified that, on one occasion, she had been unable to contact him and the RPD found this explanation to be unreasonable.\n[22] The Appellant does not deny that this difference exists between the two versions, but argues that what happened in the U.S. is peripheral to the appeal.\n[23] I consider that if the other elements of proof in the appeal were consistent, and this were the only problem, then it would be outweighed by the other elements. But when taken as a whole, with the other problems, I find that this inconsistency regarding allegations of when and if the Appellant had communicated with the alleged agent of persecution while in the U.S. is relevant. This is an additional inconsistency that is weighed with the others, the totality of which lessens the credibility of the allegations.\nConclusion on Credibility\n[24] When I weigh the factors that undermine the Appellant's credibility against those that do not, I find that the concerns outweigh the elements that are credible, and conclude that the Appellant has not established her core allegations on the balance of probabilities. Simply put, I find that the elements that are consistent in her evidence are far less than those which are inconsistent. I therefore find that the RPD did not err in its finding that the Appellant was not credible in her core allegations.\nCompelling Circumstances\n[25] The Appellant provided arguments that compelling circumstances should be considered in this appeal. As I have found that the Appellant is not credible on the core allegations of her claim, which is determinative of the appeal, I will not be addressing this issue.\nDETERMINATION\n[26] The appeal is dismissed. I confirm the RPD decision that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee under s 96 nor a person in need of protection under s 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\n(signed)\nReisa Khalifa\nMe Reisa Khalifa\nApril 22, 2021\nDate\nRK\/in\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD File \/ Dossier de la SAR : MC0-01801\nRAD.25.02 (January, 2020)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n2\nImmigration and Refugee\nBoard of Canada\nRefugee Appeal Division\nCommission de l'immigration\net du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 du Canada\nSection d'appel des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s\nRAD.25.02 (January, 2020)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] XXXX XXXX (the \"Appellant\"), a citizen of Pakistan, appeals a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) denying his claim for refugee protection. He has submitted new evidence in support of his claim. He has not requested an oral hearing. The Appellant requests that the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) set aside the determination of the RPD and find that he is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. Alternatively, the Appellant requests that the matter be remitted to the RPD for reconsideration by a differently constituted panel.\nDetermination\n[2] Pursuant to section 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), the RAD confirms the determination of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. The appeal is dismissed.\nBackground\n[3] The Appellant alleged in his Basis of Claim (BOC) form that he is a homosexual and a bisexual, and he has been targeted due to his sexual orientation. He further alleged that he has been in a homosexual relationship with XXXX XXXX since they were youths. They conducted their adult relationship in a secure place in his office. His relationship with XXXX raised questions in the minds of his employees and of his wife from 2007.\n[4] He hired two employees, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, in 2015, whom he later came to know had strong religious beliefs. Two former employees, XXXX and XXXX, who were influenced by a religious fanatic, XXXX XXXX, and a religious scholar, XXXX XXXX XXXX, turned the new employees against the Appellant.\n[5] There were extortion demands, threatening calls and a violent attack on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2015. As a result of the physical attack, he sought medical aid, and he reported the attack to the police.\n[6] There were further threatening calls, and on XXXX XXXX, 2015, while the Appellant and XXXX were in the Appellant's factory, they heard gun shots outside the factory door and they called the police.\n[7] The two employees stopped coming to the factory after the XXXX XXXX incident. The Appellant was informed by his assistant, XXXX XXXX, that the two employees had hatched a \"gruesome murderous and blackmailing conspiracy scheme\" with XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[8] The Appellant and XXXX went into hiding. The Appellant received a call from his assistant, XXXX XXXX, and he was advised to run for his life. The threat was relayed to XXXX by an unknown caller.\n[9] The Appellant called his wife on XXXX XXXX, 2015, and he learned she had been told about his homosexual relationship, and the religious workers and disciples of XXXX XXXX XXXX visited his home to search for the Appellant.\n[10] The Appellant left Pakistan on XXXX XXXX, 2015, entered Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2015, and made a claim for protection in September 2015.\nThe Issues\n[11] The panel indicated the determinative issue in regard to this claim is credibility.\n[12] The Appellant submits that the issues in this appeal are the following:\n(a) whether the panel erred in its credibility finding regarding the Appellant's sexual orientation;\n(b) whether the panel erred in its credibility finding regarding the partner's sexual orientation and his purported affidavit;\n(c) whether the panel erred in its credibility finding regarding the alleged XXXX XXXX, 2015 attack; and\n(d) whether the panel erred in its findings concerning failure to claim elsewhere\/reavailment.\nThe Role of the RAD\n[13] While the IRPA sets out grounds for appeal as well as possible remedies, it does not specify the standard by which the RAD is to review the decision of the lower tribunal.\n[14] The RAD now has the benefit of Federal Court jurisprudence which speaks to the appellate tribunal's role in relation to that of the RPD.\n[15] In this regard, the Court, in Huruglica, considered the appropriate relationship between the RAD and the RPD.1 In Huruglica, the Court determined that the RAD is to conduct a \"hybrid appeal\". It is to review all aspects of the RPD's decision and come to an independent assessment of the Appellant's refugee claim, deferring to the RPD only where the lower tribunal enjoys a particular advantage in reaching a conclusion. Where the RAD's assessment departs from that of the RPD, the RAD must substitute its own determination.\n[16] The Court determined that, in conducting its assessment, the RAD can recognize and respect the conclusion of the RPD on such issues as credibility and\/or where the RPD enjoys a particular advantage in reaching such a conclusion. The RAD is, however, not restricted, as an appellate court is, to intervening on the facts only where there is a \"palpable and overriding error\".\n[17] A recent decision of the Federal Court of Appeal2 has confirmed the central elements of Huruglica. The Court held that the RAD should use the correctness standard with respect to questions of fact, law and mixed fact and law. The RAD is to intervene when the RPD is wrong in fact, law and mixed fact and law. The Court further stated that there may be cases where the RPD enjoys a meaningful advantage over the RAD in making findings of fact and mixed fact and law, because they require an assessment of the credibility or weight to be given to the oral evidence it hears. The Court stated as well that an appeal to the RAD is not a true de novo proceeding. It does not start anew, and the original decision is not ignored in all respects.\n[18] The RAD will review all of the evidence in the RPD's record and come to its own independent assessment of whether the Appellant is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\nThe Appellant's Alleged Sexual Orientation\n[19] The panel noted in the hearing that the Appellant described himself in his BOC form as being a \"natural born homosexual\". The panel further noted that he subsequently described himself as being bisexual. The Appellant testified that he was homosexual and explained that the reference to his being bisexual may be a typing or spelling mistake or in recognition that he is married. Counsel, in the hearing, submitted that the inconsistency is not material as in Pakistan, homosexuality is kept hidden, and the Appellant's knowledge of such terms would be child-like.\n[20] The panel noted that the 519's LGBT Newcomer Community Services Coordinator indicated that \"many claimants have difficulty talking about their same-sex attraction, sexual activities or gender expression because these experiences had to be kept secret in their home country to avoid violence.\" The panel found however that the Appellant's inconsistent testimony in identifying his sexual orientation is not credible. The panel further found the Appellant's inconsistency to be material as his claim is founded on his alleged sexual orientation.\n[21] The panel noted that the Appellant's description in his BOC of his relationship with XXXX was \"flowery and intimate\", and there was no evidence that the Appellant was reluctant to discuss his sexual orientation. The panel further noted that the style and content of the Appellant's written narrative was quite different from his testimony which the panel noted was stilted, evasive and confusing.\n[22] The Appellant submits that his written contradiction concerning his sexual orientation as homosexual or bisexual does not change the reality or resulting danger from the fact that he is attracted to men. The Appellant further submits that the panel never expressed any concern or doubt that he is attracted to men. The Appellant submits as well that Webster's definition of bisexual indicates that it is someone who is attracted to both men and women.\n[23] The Appellant submits that the panel's negative credibility inference in this regard is unwarranted. The Appellant further submits that this error of words is not, in itself, sufficient to conclude that he is not attracted to men and therefore in danger.\n[24] The RAD has reviewed the evidence in the record concerning the Appellant's description of his sexual orientation. The RAD notes that the Appellant is well educated and he knows English. The RAD further notes that one cannot be both homosexual and bisexual and finds that a person in the Appellant's circumstances should be able to identify his sexual orientation specifically and accurately. The RAD finds that the Appellant's oral and written evidence in this regard may not be sufficient in itself to conclude that he is not attracted to men, but it raises a doubt as to his alleged sexual orientation.\nThe Appellant's Partner's Sexual Orientation and his Purported Affidavit\n[25] The panel noted that the Appellant testified that his alleged partner, XXXX, is homosexual. The panel further noted that XXXX indicated in his purported affidavit that he is the Appellant's \"homosexual partner\" and \"was born with bi-sexual propensity\".3 The panel noted as well that the Appellant seemed surprised by the reference to his alleged partner's bisexuality. The Appellant testified that he knows that XXXX was only homosexual from the beginning of their relationship.\n[26] The panel indicated that it considered counsel's submission that the inconsistency needs to be considered in the cultural context of how sexual orientations other than heterosexual are considered in Pakistan, and that the Appellant and his partner may not understand how to describe themselves. The panel found the Appellant's explanation not credible. It further found that cultural factors do not explain the material inconsistency.\n[27] The panel reiterated its finding regarding the inconsistency in the Appellant's evidence concerning his own sexual orientation. The panel further noted that the Appellant's testimony that he did not know XXXX would describe himself as being born with \"bi-sexual propensity\" was inconsistent with the Appellant's testimony that he had been in a relationship with XXXX since the 7th or 8th grade. The panel found, if this allegation was correct, it was reasonable to expect that the Appellant would be aware of how his alleged long-term partner identified his sexual orientation.\n[28] The Appellant explained that his partner had not shared his bisexual identity with him because they were in a same-sex relationship. The panel found it not credible that the Appellant's purported partner would not have shared his view of his sexual orientation over many years, but would purport to do so in an affidavit sent to Canada. The panel further found it not credible that the Appellant seemed to be surprised in the hearing by his purported partner's description of his sexual orientation in the affidavit, as the affidavit was disclosed by the Appellant, and he would have had an opportunity to review the document. The panel noted that the Appellant would also have had an opportunity to discuss the content of the affidavit with XXXX, as he indicated he was in contact with him. The panel further noted that the Appellant did not present his purported partner as a witness, though he was afforded the opportunity to do so at the second sitting of the hearing.\n[29] The panel found, in the context of his lack of knowledge of XXXX view of his own sexuality, his uncertainty as to XXXX age and his failure to call XXXX as a witness, that the affidavit purporting to be from XXXX is untrustworthy.\n[30] The Appellant submits, on the basis of his review of the transcript of the hearing, that the panel's finding that he did not know his partner's age is unreasonable. The transcript indicates the Appellant stated that XXXX is 36 years old. The panel questioned the Appellant as to the year XXXX was born and the Appellant responded 1980. The panel noted that would make XXXX 35 years old, and the Appellant responded \"maybe\".4 The Appellant also submits that he stated XXXX precise birth date, and it was unreasonable for the panel to draw a negative credibility inference because he first stated that XXXX was 36 rather than 35. The RAD agrees with the Appellant in this regard.\n[31] In regard to the panel's negative credibility finding concerning XXXX view of his own sexuality, the Appellant submits that the panel did not take into consideration the cultural factors associated with LGBT individuals in countries where homosexuality is illegal. The Appellant further submits that bisexuality still encompasses men who enjoy relationships with other men.\n[32] The Appellant submits as well that the crux of the matter is whether his relationship with XXXX put his life in danger.\n[33] The Appellant submits that the panel's negative inference based on the fact that he did not call XXXX as a witness in the hearing failed to take into account the reality facing XXXX at the time. The Appellant notes that XXXX was in hiding in XXXX, and he would have been expected to give detailed oral information by telephone about his sexual orientation while residing in someone else's home. The Appellant submits that it was unreasonable for the panel to assume that XXXX would have a safe space in which to communicate openly about his sexual orientation.\n[34] The Appellant notes that XXXX was residing in a different city from where the violent events transpired. The Appellant submits that it is more likely that he did not inform his host about the detailed reasons for his need to flee XXXX.\n[35] The Appellant submits as well that it was likely only possible for XXXX to give his sworn evidence in the form of an affidavit, as it is a much more private and personal way of giving evidence.\n[36] The RAD has reviewed XXXX affidavit5 and also the panel's analysis of this document and the circumstances in which it was written. The RAD notes that XXXX refers to both his homosexual and bisexual identities, as did the Appellant. The RAD finds that this raises a doubt as to XXXX sexual orientation.\n[37] The RAD further notes that XXXX indicates his wife was aware of his relationship with the Appellant, and it was family members who arranged for a hiding place for XXXX. The RAD further finds that, in this context, it is likely that XXXX host was aware of the reason he went into hiding, and he could have safely provided evidence by phone in the hearing.\n[38] The RAD notes as well that, in this regard, the Appellant disclosed an October 28, 2015 email letter from XXXX which indicates that he is staying with a man named XXXX XXXX who \"has been respectful and caring about my life by providing me shelter at his home\".\n[39] The RAD notes as well that the \"Affidavit\" disclosed in the Appellant's record does not include evidence that it was sworn before a notary. The RAD finds, in any case, that if XXXX did share this document with a notary, he was making its contents known to a stranger and therefore placing himself in danger, rather than rendering his evidence by telephone when he was likely alone in a room in the home of a friend.\n[40] The RAD further notes that XXXX indicated in this document that he and the Appellant fled their homes and went into hiding.6 The RAD further notes that the panel has found below that the Appellant's allegation that he went into hiding is not credible. The RAD notes as well that the Appellant has not contested that finding. The RAD finds that the panel's uncontested finding in this regard raises a significant doubt as to XXXX statement in this regard and therefore as to the integrity of the affidavit.\nThe XXXX XXXX, 2015 Attack\n[41] The panel found the Appellant's testimony regarding the XXXX XXXX attack to be confusing and evasive as to who he believed was responsible and the source of the information for his belief. The panel noted that the Appellant did not respond directly to questions in this regard. The panel further noted that counsel agreed with him that the Appellant's testimony was confusing and circular.\n[42] The panel noted that the Appellant answered the question regarding those responsible for the attack only after laboured testimony and a prompted question from counsel. Counsel asked the Appellant, \"Are you saying that XXXX XXXX told you specifically that XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX are responsible for the XXXX XXXX attack?\" The Appellant responded yes and explained that XXXX XXXX learned this information when he received a call from XXXX XXXX who gave XXXX XXXX this information.\n[43] The panel found the Appellant's lack of credibility in regard to his testimony concerning the XXXX XXXX attack undermined his account of having been targeted because he is homosexual. The panel further found the Appellant's lack of credibility as to the XXXX XXXX incident undermined the credibility of all that flowed from it, including the alleged XXXX XXXX, 2015 incident and the documentary evidence associated with it.\n[44] The Appellant submits that the panel's finding regarding his testimony concerning the XXXX XXXX incident is unreasonable. The Appellant notes that the panel asked only two questions regarding this incident in the first sitting, and he provided clear, direct and concise answers.\n[45] The Appellant notes that the second sitting was largely conducted by his counsel, and there was detailed questioning about the XXXX XXXX incident. The Appellant has provided citations from the transcript of the hearing and submits that his testimony was quite straight forward. The Appellant further submits that his testimony was consistent in his responses concerning this issue. He stated that he did not know who attacked him at the time of the incident but found out later.\n[46] The Appellant submits that the panel's negative credibility inference was unwarranted, and therefore the panel's subsequent finding that it undermined his credibility of \"all that flowed from it, including the alleged XXXX XXXX, 2015 incident and documentary evidence relating thereto\" is also unreasonable.\n[47] The RAD has reviewed the evidence in the record concerning this incident, including the transcript of the hearing. The RAD is not persuaded by the Appellant's argument in this regard and agrees with the panel and counsel that the Appellant's testimony was confusing.\n[48] The RAD notes that counsel's initial question to the Appellant concerned who was responsible for the attack, and the Appellant responded that he did not know at the time, but he came to know later. The RAD further notes that XXXX indicated in his affidavit that \"...it is also a fact that we did not doubt about these workers' involvement when XXXX was intercepted and beaten on his way to market\".7\n[49] The RAD notes as well that the Appellant stated in his BOC that the two new workers, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, turned \"stubbornly against me\", and they were influenced by \"a fanatic religious worker XXXX XXXX extreme thoughts and verdicts against me\". The Appellant's BOC statement continues that these two workers intended to \"collect solid evidence and exploit me for extortion of money at the threats of exposing my relationship to some fanatic religious clerics and miscreants of banned religious organizations\". The Appellant states as well that the two workers \"joined hand in hand with influential religious scholar XXXX XXXX XXXX\".8\n[50] The RAD finds, in the context of the Appellant's statements noted above, that he would have been aware of the persons responsible for the alleged XXXX XXXX attack, as he stated they were involved in a \"conspiracy\" against him.9 The RAD further finds that his testimony that he was not aware at the time of the responsible persons is not credible.\n[51] The RAD notes that the Appellant testified that his secretary, XXXX XXXX, told him about the people responsible for the XXXX XXXX attack. The Appellant testified that, after the alleged XXXX XXXX XXXX 2015 incident, XXXX XXXX answered a call to the Appellant \"from an unknown person\", and the caller told him that \"wherever you are right now telling him he should run away\". The Appellant further testified that XXXX XXXX told him that the person who called was XXXX XXXX. The RAD notes in this regard that the Appellant initially testified that the caller was unknown. The RAD further notes that the Appellant stated in his BOC that XXXX XXXX told the Appellant that \"the caller most probably was XXXX XXXX\".10\n[52] The RAD notes that no corroborative evidence was provided as to XXXX XXXX alleged conversations with the Appellant. The RAD further notes that the Appellant indicated in his BOC that XXXX XXXX was told in the telephone call that \"the religious workers have traced my location and they were running towards my hiding place and would make a ghost of me if I did not quickly move from this place\".11\n[53] The RAD notes that the panel has found below that the Appellant's allegation that he went into hiding is not credible, and the Appellant has made no submissions challenging that finding. The RAD finds, in this context, that the reference to the Appellant's hiding place in the alleged conversation with XXXX XXXX renders this evidence not credible.\n[54] The RAD has considered all of the evidence regarding the alleged conspiracy orchestrated by two workers in the Appellant's factory, two former workers, a fanatic religious worker and a religious scholar. The RAD finds the Appellant's allegation concerning this conspiracy strains credulity. The RAD notes that the Appellant stated in his BOC that the conspirators were attempting to extort money from him, but he provides no evidence other than his uncorroborated statements that any extortion took place. The RAD further finds that the Appellant's allegation that the conspirators were coming to kill him simply makes no sense, if they wanted to extort money from him.\n[55] The RAD notes that Pakistani law provides for harsh penalties for those accused of homosexuality. In this context, the RAD finds that the alleged leadership role of a religious scholar in an effort to kill the Appellant lacks plausibility. Rather than risking involvement in a murder, all that XXXX XXXX XXXX and his associates would have had to do is denounce the Appellant as a homosexual and allow the police and the judiciary to deal with his \"criminality\". The RAD finds it likely that the alleged \"conspiracy\" is an invention to support the Appellant's allegation concerning his sexual orientation.\nThe Allegation of Being in Hiding\n[56] The panel found the Appellant's testimony of having gone into hiding to be evasive. The panel noted that the Appellant's account in his BOC does not provide clear information about when he did so.\n[57] The panel questioned the Appellant about when he went into hiding, and the Appellant stated he did so just after the XXXX XXXX, 2015 incident. The Appellant was asked to be more specific, and he repeated his statement, just after the XXXX XXXX incident. The question was repeated, and the Appellant stated that he went into hiding on the night of XXXX XXXX.\n[58] The panel found the Appellant contradicted his account that he was in hiding since the night of XXXX XXXX. The Appellant testified he hid in different places until he left Pakistan. The panel asked the Appellant what he meant by being in hiding, and he responded that he did not leave the place he was staying, and he left only to go to another hiding place. The panel noted however that the Appellant disclosed purported applications dated XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX to register a case with the police, and his signatures were on the applications.12 The Appellant explained that he did not leave his hiding place, and he made the applications through a lawyer whom he had contacted earlier.\n[59] The panel found this explanation not to be credible, as there is no reference to such assistance in the Appellant's BOC, and the Appellant's account changed in response to further questioning. The panel noted that the BOC provides instructions in Question 2(c) to provide details of seeking protection and \"whom you approached for help\".13 The panel further noted that the Appellant's response states, \"Please see attached narrative.\"14 The panel noted as well there is no mention in the narrative that the Appellant engaged the services of a lawyer.\n[60] The Appellant explained that he did not mention the assistance of the person he contacted in his formal capacity as a lawyer and therefore did not mention this person in his narrative. The Appellant was asked to explain why the name of the person who helped him does not appear on the applications. The Appellant responded that the person is not a lawyer but someone who assists with the writing of various court applications.\n[61] The panel noted that the Appellant's account in this regard changed in response to the further questioning. The panel found the Appellant's account of having been in hiding lacked credibility, and this undermined the reliability of the Applications for Registration of a Case that he provided which are dated purportedly while he alleged he was in hiding.15 The panel further found the reliability of the associated First Investigation Reports16 is also materially affected.\n[62] The RAD notes that the Appellant makes no submission regarding the findings of the panel noted above. The RAD finds therefore that the panel's findings regarding the Appellant's allegation that he went into hiding and also regarding the documentation concerning reports to the police are unchallenged.\nReavailment\n[63] The panel noted that the Appellant has travelled to the UK in 2004, Canada in 2005, Germany in 2009 and 2013 and France in 2014. The Appellant explained these were business trips, and, therefore, he did not make any claims for protection. The Appellant further stated that, at the time of these trips, his situation was not as serious as in 2015, when he was personally targeted by agents of persecution who had become aware of his sexual orientation.\n[64] The Appellant was asked why he did not make a claim during any of his travels, as he had to keep his relationship with XXXX a secret over a long period of time. The Appellant reiterated his explanation that his situation became serious only in 2015, and he did not want to leave his family and XXXX and his business was doing well.\n[65] The panel did not find this explanation credible. The panel noted that the Appellant stated in his BOC that he was living in \"suffocation throughout [his] life\" because he had to keep his sexual orientation secret.17 He also acknowledged that homosexual conduct is a criminal offence in Pakistan, subject to a fine and two years' to life imprisonment.18 The panel noted that the Appellant had multiple opportunities to make a claim in Canada, France, the UK and Germany and, as a university-educated businessman, he had the further opportunity to make enquiries about the possibility of making a refugee claim in these countries.\n[66] The panel found the Appellant's account of having been targeted in Pakistan due to his sexual orientation is not credible.\n[67] The Appellant submits that his life was not in immediate danger on the various occasions he travelled. The Appellant further submits that he provided reasonable justification for failing to make a claim during these trips, that he did not want to leave his family, partner and business, and that he was able to keep his relationship with XXXX secret. The Appellant submits as well that he did not feel sufficiently persecuted until the threat to his life.\n[68] The RAD has reviewed all of the evidence concerning the Appellant's travels and repeated returns to Pakistan. The RAD acknowledges the Appellant's argument that he was not in immediate danger during these trips abroad and therefore returned each time to Pakistan. The RAD finds, however, in the context of statements in the Appellant's BOC concerning the awareness of various people about his likely sexual orientation, his unhappiness with his life in Pakistan and also his jeopardy in Pakistan if he were discovered to be involved in homosexual activities, that the panel did not err in drawing a negative credibility inference as to his repeated reavailment to Pakistan.\n[69] The RAD notes that the Appellant indicated that his life as a homosexual in Pakistan was \"miserable\" and that Pakistan \"has highest and irrevocable intolerance, rigid to its fundamental values and ethical ferocities\". He further stated that homosexuality is a crime \"deserving scornful and certain death...\"19 The Appellant stated as well that \"being caught was a huge risk in Pakistan and that, even if someone suspects one to be homosexual, the attitude of the people becomes unbearable as they commence public humiliation...\"20\n[70] The Appellant further stated in his BOC that he was born with both feminine and masculine features, and, as a result, people \"slighted and spurned me, refrained from associating with me\".21 He also stated that, after he took control of his father's business in 2000, workers in his factory \"started to harbor doubts about relationship between me and my boyfriend...\" The Appellant stated as well that his relationship with XXXX \"created more questions in the minds of the people around us including skilled labor my business was dependent on as well as my family members including my parents and wife\".22 The Appellant stated, \"Business has become a far cry due to bad words spread around in the business community....\"23\n[71] The RAD notes that the Appellant's family is wealthy and that he is well educated. The RAD finds, in the context of the Appellant's evidence concerning his fears and concerns over many years, that it strains credulity that he would not have sought refugee protection during one of his trips to countries where it was clearly available. As noted above, the RAD concurs with the panel's finding in this regard.\nAdmissibility of New Evidence Presented on Appeal\n[72] Section 110(4) of the IRPA provides that the Appellant may present only evidence that arose after the rejection of his\/her claim or that was not reasonably available, or that he\/she could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection of the claim.\n[73] The Appellant submits a newspaper clipping dated XXXX XXXX, 2015, describing a shooting. The clipping states that unknown persons fired shots at the main gate of the factory and XXXX XXXX was present inside the gate of his factory.\n[74] The RAD has assessed this document in the context of the statutory requirements noted above. The RAD notes the article is dated XXXX XXXX, 2015, almost eight months before the panel made its decision. The RAD further notes that the panel rendered its decision approximately two months after the hearing, and there was clearly sufficient time for the Appellant to provide this document before the decision was made.\n[75] The RAD notes that the Appellant submitted that he had tendered other articles that corroborate the allegation of the event, but the panel did not give weight to them. The RAD notes that these documents are undated, and one of them consists of two clippings-one clipping described the incident and another is only the letterhead of the paper.24 The other article is merely circled on an untranslated page of a newspaper. The clipping concerning the incident is translated, but there is no evidence of the name of the newspaper or the date of the story.25 The RAD further notes that there is no evidence in these articles that the alleged incident is related to the Appellant's sexual orientation.\n[76] The RAD finds that the proposed new evidence does not meet the statutory requirement that it arose after the RPD's decision or that it was not reasonably available to the Appellant before the RPD's decision was made. The RAD determines that the document is not admitted as new evidence.\n[77] The RAD concludes that there is insufficient credible evidence to support a finding that the Appellant is a homosexual who is in danger of persecution by the alleged agents of persecution or by Pakistani authorities.\nDISPOSITION\n[78] Pursuant to section 111(1)(a) of the IRPA, the RAD confirms the determination of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. The appeal is dismissed.\n(signed)\n\"Milton Israel\"\nMilton Israel\nMay 25, 2016\nDate\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD.25.02 (June 23, 2014)\nRAD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SAR :\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (Principal Appellant) and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (Associate Appellants), (collectively the Appellants), citizens of Honduras, appeal a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD), dated April 17, 2019, rejecting their claims for refugee protection.\n[2] The Appellants allege that they have been targeted over a 15-year period because the Principal Appellant witnessed the murder of her brother-in-law who was targeted for not paying extortion money to organized criminals. The Appellants claim that they are being targeted by criminal elements in order to keep them silent about what they know of the killing.\n[3] The RPD found that the Appellants would have access to adequate state protection in Honduras and therefore rejected their claim.\n[4] The Appellants argue on appeal that the RPD erred in finding that there is adequate state protection for the Appellants in Honduras.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[5] In an Affidavit submitted as part of the Appellants' Record, the Principal Appellant has requested that the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) admit as evidence a report of a murder signed by the Deputy Director of the Department of Criminal Investigations of the Honduras National Police. The report is on official letterhead with signature and seal. The original Spanish report is accompanied by a certified English translation. The Appellants have not requested an oral hearing.\n[6] In order to be considered, new evidence must meet the requirements of section 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)1 and the Singh\/Raza2 factors being credibility, relevance and newness.\n[7] Section 110(4) states that new evidence may only be presented at the RAD if the proposed new evidence arose after the rejection of the claim or; it was not reasonably available at the time of the rejection or; that the person could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented the evidence at the time of the rejection. In terms of evidence that arose after the rejection of the claim, it is the content of the evidence and not the date of the document that is determinative. With respect to the admissibility of new evidence, the burden lies with the Appellant. The RAD applies a narrow interpretation of section 110(4). This is not an opportunity to complete a deficient record submitted before the RPD.3 It is expected that full and detailed submissions on the admissibility and the relevance of the proposed new evidence will be included.4\n[8] Following an independent analysis of the new evidence, I admit the evidence for the reasons that follow.\n[9] The Principal Appellant explained that the police report was not reasonably available at the time that the RPD rejected their claim because the victim's sister, her sister-in-law, who had submitted the initial information to police, had moved to La Ceiba following the murder. La Ceiba is approximately seven hours drive from Tegucigalpa where the murder occurred and police the report was filed. The Principal Appellant explained that her sister-in-law, as the complainant, could obtain a copy of the police report however the Principal Appellant could not get a copy herself from outside Honduras. The Principal Appellant explained that her sister-in-law only travelled back to Tegucigalpa and obtained a copy after the RPD hearing.\n[10] Evidence from the Research Directorate, Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, confirms that police reports can only be obtained by the by applying in-person within Honduras and providing the original file number.5\n[11] I find that the new evidence satisfies the requirements for admission set out in section 110(4).\n[12] I find that the new evidence also satisfies the factors set out in Singh\/Raza. The police report is credible in that it is on official letterhead, it is signed by an identifiable officer and it bears an official seal. The report is relevant because it confirms that the Principal Appellant was a witness to a murder, a central issue in the Appellants' claim. The report satisfies the requirement for newness in that it was not available at the RPD hearing.\nROLE OF THE RAD\n[13] When reviewing the RPD decision, I am required to independently determine whether the RPD was correct in relation to each alleged error of law, fact or mixed fact and law. I may defer to the RPD's credibility assessment of oral testimony, if I find that the RPD had a meaningful advantage in the circumstances.6 Reasons will be provided in my analysis if I find that the RPD had a meaningful advantage.\nANALYSIS\n[14] I have conducted an independent assessment of the evidence and arguments.7\n[15] The RPD found that that Appellants did not establish a nexus to one of the Convention8 grounds, therefore the RPD analyzed the claims for protection under section 97(1) of IRPA. The Appellants did not contest this finding on appeal, indeed they specifically request that the RAD make a finding under section 97(1)9. I have analyzed the Appellants' claims under section 97(1).\n[16] The RPD resolved the case on the basis of state protection without deciding on credibility.10\n[17] Sworn evidence is presumed to be true unless the presumption of truth is rebutted. The RPD did not identify any issues that would, in the mind of the RPD, serve to rebut the presumption of truth. I have conducted my own independent analysis of the testimony and the evidence and I find no reason to doubt the truthfulness of the Appellants. I find that the Appellants are credible with respect to the core elements of their claim.\n[18] A police report that was not before the RPD corroborates that the Principal Appellant's testimony that she witnessed the murder of her brother-in-law and that her name is part of the public record as the sole witness to the murder.\nThe RPD erred in finding that adequate state protection exists for the Appellants\n[19] The determinative issue for the RPD in this claim was state protection. The Appellants argue on appeal that the RPD erred in finding that the Appellants would receive adequate state protection in Honduras. The Appellants have adduced new evidence in the form of a police report that was not available to the RPD. I have conducted an independent analysis of the arguments and the evidence, including the new evidence that was not available to the RPD. Based on my independent analysis, I reach a different conclusion than the RPD. I find that that the Appellants would not receive adequate stare protection in Honduras for the reasons that follow.\n[20] Jurisprudence has established that the fundamental standard for state protection is adequacy at the operational level with regard to the country and the circumstances.11\n[21] The Appellants argue on appeal that \"the RPD's Decision on State Protection was incorrect and unreasonable because the Appellants did seek protection from the police authorities on numerous occasions yet it was no help.\"\n[22] The RPD notes in its decision that the Principal Appellant was not able to identify the agents of persecution by name, where they live, in what country they live, where they work, or with which particular group they are associated. The Principal Appellant testified consistently that she could identify the men who killed her brother-in-law by sight, but that she had no further information about their identity.\n[23] A United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) report states that:\nThe current dynamics of violence in Honduras stem from the presence and activities of four main forms of armed actors: gangs and criminal bands, including those affiliated with the Barrio 18, Mara Salvatrucha (MS) and Chirizos gang structures; drug smuggling structures (sometimes also referred toas transportistas); the State security forces, particularly the police and the armed forces; and private security forces. In practice, it may not always be possible for victims to make a clear distinction between the various actors, in part because of allegations of high levels of infiltration of the State security forces by organized criminal structures, and of high levels of corruption within many organs of the State.12\n[24] Given the circumstances under which the Principal Appellant witnessed the murder of her brother-in-law and the objective assessment of the UNHCR, I do not take negative inference from the fact that the Principal Appellant is not able to provide detailed information on the persons she fears.\n[25] The RPD canvassed the evidence regarding criminality and state protection in Honduras and concluded that \"the evidence regarding state protection is mixed\".13 I have relied upon the assessment of the UNHCR to find that witnesses of crime and their family members, such as the Appellants, do not receive operationally effective state protection and that they are at high risk of being killed in Honduras.\n[26] A recent UNHCR report states:\nWitnesses and victims of crimes committed by gangs and other organized criminal groups in Honduras have reportedly been killed by the perpetrators to ensure their silence, even when they have not sought to formally denounce those crimes to the authorities. Those who do denounce the crimes, or who otherwise cooperate with the authorities against gangs or other organized crime groups as 'informants', are reportedly routinely pursued for their 'betrayal', often along with their family members, even when placed in a witness protection programme.14\n[27] Based on my analysis of the evidence and the particular circumstances of the Appellants, I find that the Appellants would not receive adequate state protection in Honduras.\nThe Appellants do not have an Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) in Honduras\n[28] I find that the Appellants do not have an IFA in Honduras for reasons similar to the reasons I found that they would be targeted and would not have adequate state protection. Honduras is a small country with high rates of criminal immunity and state protection is not adequate or effective for individuals with profiles such as the Appellants' profile.\nCONCLUSION\n[29] I find that the Appellants would be personally subject to a risk to life or to a risk of cruel and unusual punishment in Honduras.\nDETERMINATION\n[30] The appeal is allowed. Pursuant to section 111(1)(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the RAD sets aside the determination of the RPD and substitutes its own determination that the Appellants are persons in need of protection.\n(signed)\n\"Michael J.

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (Principal Appellant), XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (Associate Appellants), citizens of Nigeria, appealed a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD), dated July 8, 2019, rejecting their claims for refugee protection. They are asking the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) to substitute the RPD decision with a positive one recognizing them as Convention refugees or, in the alternative, to send the matter back to the RPD for redetermination.\nBACKGROUND\n[2] The Principal Appellant claims that he overheard a conversation about illegal activities being carried out by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the leader of the Badoo Cult. He alleges that he reported this activity to the police and as a result he and his family have been threatened. The Principal Appellant claims that after he went to the police, he began receiving threatening phone calls. He further alleges that in December 2017 there was an attempt to kidnap his children at their school. The Appellants allege that following this attempt they went into hiding at their lawyer's home. They allege that a group of men went to their apartment looking for them and they believe these men were from the Badoo cult. The Appellants left Nigeria on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018 for the United States. They entered Canada on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018 through an irregular border crossing and initiated refugee claims.\n[3] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) found that the Appellants' evidence was not credible. The RPD also found that they have an internal flight alternative (IFA) in Port Harcourt or Benin City and rejected their claims. For the following reasons, the appeal is denied.\nROLE OF THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION\n[4] The Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) reviews decisions of the RPD on a standard of correctness after conducting an independent assessment of the evidence before it. The exception to this rule is where the RPD enjoys a meaningful advantage in the assessment and weighing of oral testimony heard, which in particular cases, attracts deference. Unless specifically stated below, I have applied a correctness standard.1\nANALYSIS\nAppellants' arguments\n[5] The Appellants argue that the RPD erred in finding that their allegations were not credible. The Appellants argue that the RPD was microscopic in its analysis of the apparent contradictions and omissions in the Appellants' evidence.\n[6] The Appellants also argue that the RPD's analysis of the IFA was unreasonable. The Appellants argue that they face a risk of serious harm in the proposed IFA. Further, they submit the RPD improperly relied on the Nigerian Jurisprudential Guide (JG) in its analysis of the IFA. The Appellants seek to rely on the arguments that the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers (CARL) advanced before the federal court, including that the JG \"improperly filters the board member's discretion.\"2\nCredibility\nThe circumstances of the phone call\n[7] The Appellants argue that the RPD made its credibility findings on microscopic details and treated the Principal Appellant's testimony as a memory test. The Appellants argue that the RPD \"blames\" the Principal Appellant for making a \"mistake\" in his evidence about the circumstances around how he learned of the Badoo leader's criminal activities. The RPD found that there was a significant contradiction in the Principal Appellant's evidence about how he overheard a conversation which implicated the Badoo Cult leader in illegal activities. Having independently reviewed the record, I agree with the findings of the RPD about the inconsistency in the Principal Appellant's evidence.\n[8] The RPD noted that the Principal Appellant's narrative indicated that he was with his friend Princess XXXX XXXX, when he overheard her speaking to the cult leader on the phone. The Principal Appellant's narrative failed to mention that the cult leader and Princess had a child or that he was at a party for this child when the phone call happened. In his testimony, the Principal Appellant claimed that he was at a party with both the Princess and cult leader celebrating their child. He testified that at this party he overheard the cult leader on the phone with an unknown person discussing a deal worth 1 billion Naira, which he believed was criminal in nature.\n[9] I agree with the RPD that this is a significant contradiction about an important event in the Appellants' evidence. This event was what allegedly led to the problems the Appellants faced in Nigeria. I do not accept the Appellants' arguments that the narrative simply contained less detail and that the Principal Appellant was only expanding on his initial allegation in his testimony. Rather, there is a direct contradiction in his evidence about who he overheard speaking on the phone about this illegal deal. I also find the contradiction about whether the Principal Appellant was with the Princess or with both her and the cult leader when this conversation occurred to be significant. Given that overhearing this phone conversation is what led him to go to the police with his concerns, I would expect that the Principal Appellant would clearly recall who was on the phone having this conversation and who was with him at the time.\n[10] I also agree with the RPD that it was a significant omission that in the Appellants' narrative that the cult leader and the Princess had a child together and he was at a party celebrating this child when he overheard the phone conversation about the illegal activities. The Appellants argue that the Principal Appellant was simply adding to the information in his narrative when he testified about the child and the party. Given the significance of this event to the Appellants' allegation and the other contradictions in his evidence, I find that these omissions are serious and undermine the credibility of the allegations.\nThe Police Report\n[11] The Appellants argue that the RPD improperly determined the police report they provided was not credible. They argue that although the report lacked some details, the Principal Appellant provided the information that was crucial. They argue that the RPD placed too high a standard on the Principal Appellant given his social background and knowledge. The RPD found that this report was not credible given the lack of detail about how the Principal Appellant became aware of the cult leader's illegal activities and therefore gave the document no weight.\n[12] I agree with the RPD that there are significant omissions in the Police report, and that the Principal Appellant's explanation for this is not reasonable. Further, I note the police report does not independently corroborate the Appellants' allegations. At most, it suggests that the cult leader was arrested and made bail. It does not provide any independent investigation about the Appellants' claims regarding how the Principal Appellant came to know of the illegal activities or the threats that occurred after he went to the Police. The report restates the claims the Appellants made to the police, via their lawyer, without any further investigation or corroboration. Given the previous credibility concerns with the Principal Appellant's evidence, I give this report no weight.\nThe Newspaper argument\n[13] The Appellants make no arguments challenging the finding of the RPD that this article lacked credibility. I have reviewed the record and agree with the conclusion of the RPD. Given the concerns with the Appellants' overall credibility and the Principal Appellant's inability to provide information as to who wrote the article and how they knew about the alleged events, I agree that this article should be given no weight.\nInternal flight alternative\n[14] The Appellants argue that the finding that there was a viable IFA is unreasonable and that the RPD improperly relied on the Nigerian JG in its analysis. The RPD found that notwithstanding the findings about the Appellants' lack of credibility, there was an IFA available to them in Port Harcourt or Benin City. I have conducted my own independent analysis of the evidence and find that there is a viable IFA for the Appellants in Port Harcourt or Benin City.\n[15] Nigeria is a large country with an area of over 900,000 square kilometres in 36 states. Nigeria has a population of over 190 million people. Abuja, the nation's capital, is one of the largest cities in Nigeria with a population of approximately 2.44 million.3\n[16] The test for assessing an IFA is two-pronged and is set out in the Federal Court of Appeal decision in Rasaratnam.4\n(1) The Board must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an IFA exists and\/or the claimant would not be personally subject to a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture in the IFA.\n(2) Moreover, the conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claim, for him to seek refuge there.\n[17] Both prongs must be satisfied to find that the Appellants have an IFA. Once the issue of IFA has been raised and the potential IFAs have been identified, the burden of proof rests with the Appellants to show that they do not have an IFA. An IFA must be a realistic and attainable option.5\nFirst Prong: Is there a serious possibility of persecution in Port Harcourt or Benin?\n[18] The Appellants argue that their agent of persecution could locate them throughout Nigeria given his influence and position. The RPD found that the Appellants were able to live in their lawyer's home without being located for three months and this indicated that they could therefore escape the cult leader. The Appellants argue that they were only safe at the lawyer's home because they remained in hiding and ceased all their daily activity.\n[19] I find that the Appellants have not established that the cult leader, or his followers, have the means and motivation to find the Appellants. I agree with the RPD that the documentary evidence only indicates that the Badoo cult is active in Lagos state.6 There is nothing in the evidence to support the Appellants' position that the cult is active throughout the country or that the leader has the means to locate them.\n[20] The Principal Appellant testified that he believes that the men who attempted to take his children and who visited his apartment were part of the Badoo cult. The Principal Appellant testified that he never had any problems before he went to the police with the information about the Badoo leader and therefore believes these events are related. Given the previously outlined concerns with the Appellants' credibility, I am not persuaded, on a balance of probabilities, that these events occurred as alleged. Further, there is nothing indicating that even if these events did in fact occur, that they were carried out by the Badoo cult apart from the Appellants' suspicions.\n[21] The National Documentation Package (NDP) indicates that kidnapping occurs regularly in Nigeria for a variety of reasons. The Appellants simply suspect that the minors were approached by men as an attempt to kidnap them carried out by the Badoo cult. The visit to the Appellants' home did not involve any threats or attempts to break into the apartment, rather it was described to them by a neighbour simply as people banging on the door at an odd hour. Therefore, even believing that men went to their apartment in January 2018, there is nothing indicating that this occurrence is an indication of anything nefarious. I find there is no objective evidence that the Badoo cult was after the Appellants in Nigeria or that they could locate them if they relocated outside of Lagos state. As such, I am not persuaded the risk of the Appellants being harmed in Port Harcourt is not more than a mere possibility.\nSecond prong: Is it reasonable for the Appellants to relocate to Port Harcourt or Benin City?\n[22] It is recognized that the burden is not on the RAD to establish that the IFA is safe but rather on the Appellant to demonstrate that it is not reasonable.7 The test for the reasonableness is set out by the Federal Court of Appeal, which has held that:\n[t]here will always be hardship with relocation, but the threshold for unreasonableness is very high and requires conditions that would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant: Ranganathan v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2000 CanLII 16789 (FCA), [2001] 2 FC 164 at paras 14-15.8\n[23] The Appellants do not argue that it would be unreasonable for them to relocate to the proposed IFA, and also made no such arguments before the RPD. The Principal Appellant was asked by the RPD if the family could relocate to Port Harcourt or Benin City and he testified that \"of course\" he could establish his family in other parts of Nigeria9 but his concern was for their safety. The RPD determined the Appellants failed to meet the threshold of establishing it would be objectively unreasonable or unduly harsh for them to relocate to Port Harcourt or Benin City.\n[24] The Appellants argue that the RPD improperly relied on the Jurisprudential Guide on IFA in Nigeria (JG).10 The Appellants also wish to rely on the arguments advanced by CARL before the Federal Court in 2019 FC 1126, challenging the chairperson's jurisdiction to issue Jurisprudential Guides. The Appellants essentially argue that the JG creates an unfair burden on the Appellants and improperly encroaches on adjudicative independence.\n[25] The Federal Court considered the arguments advanced by CARL, including against the use of the Nigerian JG. The Chief Justice considered the wording of the Nigerian JG and found that the decision made it very clear that each case had to be considered on its merits, and therefore upheld the use of the JG. The court noted that the decision set out an analysis of the objective evidence about the ability of claimants fleeing non-state actors to move to other large Nigerian cities. The court held:\nConsidering the passages that I have underlined in the various quotes above, I am satisfied that the Nigeria JG does not unlawfully fetter the discretion of Board members or improperly constrain their freedom to decide cases that may come before them according to their own conscience. On the contrary, the JG makes it abundantly clear that each case must be decided on its particular facts. To the extent that Board members are expected to do anything in particular, it is simply to apply the established test for an IFA, to take account of the jurisprudence and the country documentation that is mentioned in the JG, and then to reach their own decisions based on the particular facts of the case.11\n[26] In the case before me, the Appellants themselves do not argue it would be unreasonable for them to relocate. The Principal Appellant and his wife have post-secondary education as well as significant work experience. They are both fluent in English, which is the official language in Nigeria. I find the reasoning in the Nigerian JG is supported by the documentary evidence in setting out that it is reasonable for individuals who are educated and speak the official language to relocate. The Appellants have not advanced any arguments about anything in their profile that would make relocation unreasonable. As such, I find that the Appellants have not established that it is unduly harsh or objectively unreasonable for them to relocate to Port Harcourt or Benin City.\nCONCLUSION\n[27] The RAD dismisses the appeal and confirms the decision of the RPD that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection, pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\n(signed)\n\"J.

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] The Appellant XXXX XXXX is a citizen of India who fears the Haryana police who accuse him of ties to outlawed political militants.\n[2] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) found that the Appellant has a viable internal flight alternative (IFA) in Bengaluru (also known as Bangalore).\n[3] The Appellant submits that the RPD erred in finding there is an IFA in Bengaluru.\n[4] Following my own review, I find that the Appellant has not met his burden of proof to demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that there is a serious possibility he would be persecuted or face a risk of harm in Bengaluru or that it would be objectively unreasonable in all the circumstances for him to seek refuge there.\nDECISION\n[5] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nBACKGROUND\n[6] According to his Basis of Claim form (BOC),1 the Appellant was born in 1989 and lived in Haryana state. The Appellant's XXXX had problems with the police for helping a Muslim friend who the police allege is involved with militants. The Appellant's XXXX was arrested and tortured by the police on different occasions, they questioned him about his friend and falsely accused him of working with militants too. The Appellant's XXXX was released after the payment of bribes and he disappeared in XXXX 2017. The Appellant's XXXX was arrested and tortured in XXXX 2017. He was released following the payment of a bribe but died on XXXX XXXX, 2017.\n[7] The Appellant's XXXX came to him for help in XXXX 2018 and on XXXX XXXX, 2018, the Appellant met with a lawyer to save his XXXX and file a case against the police for his XXXX death. The police found out what the Appellant was doing and on XXXX XXXX, 2018, they raided and searched his home then arrested him. They took the Appellant to the police station, questioned him about his XXXX and the militants and beat and tortured him. On XXXX XXXX, 2018, the Appellant was released with the help of influential people and the payment of a bribe after the police took his fingerprints, photos and signatures on blank papers. The police told the Appellant to report to the police station every month starting on XXXX XXXX, 2018.\n[8] Scared of the police the Appellant left his home at the end of XXXX 2018 and went to stay with relatives in Uttar Pradesh. The police looked for him when he did not fulfill the reporting condition and harassed his family. With the help of an agent, the Appellant came to Canada on July 9, 2018, and his application for refugee protection was received on September 18, 2018.\n[9] On February 1, 2021, the Appellant presented an amendment to his BOC2 stating that the police visited his house in XXXX and XXXX 2019 and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\nSCOPE OF THE RAD REVIEW\n[10] The Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) reviews decisions of the RPD on a standard of correctness after conducting an independent assessment of the evidence before it. The exception to this rule is where the RPD enjoys a meaningful advantage in assessing and weighing the oral testimony heard, which in particular cases attracts deference.3 Unless specifically stated below, I have applied the correctness standard.\nANALYSIS\n[11] The RPD identified the determinative issue as IFA in Bengaluru. The RPD determined that, on a balance of probabilities, the police officers the Appellant fears would not have the means or motivation to look for him in Bengaluru and that he has a safe and reasonable IFA there.\n[12] The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in its assessment of IFA by not taking account of the Appellant's testimony about India's tenancy verification law and in finding that he was a secondary target.\n[13] I have reviewed the evidence on the record, including the transcript of the RPD hearings and assessed the Appellant's submissions. As detailed below I agree with the RPD that the Appellant has a viable IFA in Bengaluru.\n[14] I note that the RPD found that the Appellant's allegations did not have a nexus to any of the Convention grounds and analyzed his claim under section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in its finding. As this is not a determinative issue, I need not assess the RPD's finding. In determining that a viable IFA in Bengaluru exists, I have, however, satisfied myself, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant will not be subject to persecution (on a \"serious possibility\" standard), or a section 97 danger or risk (on a \"more likely than not\" standard).\nInternal flight alternative\n[15] It is settled law that the concept of an IFA is an inherent part of the Convention refugee definition because a claimant must be a refugee from a country, not from a particular region of a country.4 The existence of an IFA is fatal to any refugee claim5 as recently confirmed in a 2020 decision of the Federal Court:\nThe concept of an IFA is an inherent part of the definition of Convention refugee: see Valasquez v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2010 FC 1201 at para 15. If it is objectively reasonable for a claimant to live elsewhere in their country of nationality without fear of persecution, the claimant is not a Convention refugee, even if they have a well-founded fear of persecution in another part of the country.6\n[16] The test for assessing an IFA was set out in a recent decision of the Federal Court:7\nTo determine if a viable IFA exists, the RAD must be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that (1) the claimant will not be subject to persecution (on a \"serious possibility\" standard), or a section 97 danger or risk (on a \"more likely than not\" standard) in the proposed IFA; and (2) in all the circumstances, including circumstances particular to the claimant, conditions in the IFA are such that it would not be unreasonable for the claimant to seek refuge there: Thirunavukkarasu at pp 595-597; Hamdan v Canada (Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship), 2017 FC 643 at paras 10-12.\nBoth of these \"prongs\" of the test must be satisfied to conclude that a refugee claimant has a viable IFA. The threshold on the second prong of the IFA test is a high one. There must be \"actual and concrete evidence\" of conditions that would jeopardize the applicants' lives and safety in travelling or temporarily relocating to a safe area: Ranganathan v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2000 CanLII 16789 (FCA), [2001] 2 FC 164 (CA) at para 15. Once the potential for an IFA is raised, the claimant bears the onus of establishing it is not viable: Thirunavukkarasu at pp 594-595.\n[17] The RPD complied with the procedural requirement to raise an IFA before or during the hearing. At the outset of the hearing on February 2, 2021, the RPD specifically identified Bengaluru8 as a potential IFA. The RPD canvassed the issue during the hearing9 and Appellant's counsel made oral submissions about IFA.10 The RPD identified the two-prong IFA test.11\nFirst prong of the IFA test: no serious possibility of persecution or not likely that the Appellant would face a risk to life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the proposed IFAs\n[18] When the RPD asked Appellant if he could safely relocate to Bengaluru, he said no. When the RPD asked the Appellant to explain his answer, he referenced the tenant verification process and its link to the Aadhaar identity card: \"the police verification is done on the basis of the Aadhaar number. So whenever a person's Aadhaar number is put into the system then the police comes to know the entire history or the background of the person and if the person has any criminal records.\"12 The Appellant testified that he does not have a criminal record and when the RPD asked him why he believed that the Haryana police would track him to Bengaluru, he said, \"[a]ll the police stations are linked to one another and when my Aadhaar number is put into the system any police personnel can find out my...background in any police station.\"13\n[19] The RPD gave three reasons for finding that the Appellant is a secondary target in the police investigation which would limit their motivation to track him down. First, if the Appellant was an important target, he would not have been released by the Haryana police in exchange for a bribe and that they had arrested him because they were looking for his XXXX friend. Second, if the police had used federal mechanisms, he would have been stopped at the New Delhi airport. Third, the Appellant lived in Uttar Pradesh for more than XXXX months without the police in that state looking for him.\n[20] The RPD cited recent objective evidence14 that addresses police databases and criminal tracking and their capacity to track persons through tenant verification which describes an inefficient system containing unreliable data whose scope is essentially symbolic at this time. The RPD also referenced objective evidence15 that interstate police searches are not highly automated, that the police lack resources and that criminals are tracked mainly in important cases or where there is political pressure to do so, which is not the Appellant's situation. ln addition, the RPD found that the investigation involving the Appellant and his family is being conducted using illegal means, which makes it less likely that the Haryana police force would share the details of its investigation with other Indian police forces.\n[21] The Appellant submits that the RPD erred in concluding he would be safe in Bengaluru referencing the information he provided in his hearing about India's tenancy verification law and how the Haryana police could easily track him down. The Appellant also argues that the fact that he was not detained leaving the airport in New Delhi does not mean that the tenant verification may not be used by the police, even though they did not previously use federal mechanisms to stop him at the airport. The Appellant also argues that the RPD erred in finding that he is a secondary target and taking into account that the police did not find him in Uttar Pradesh.\n[22] As detailed below, I have reviewed the objective evidence16 relating to the functioning of the tenant verification system and it does not support the Appellant's testimony that he will be traced through tenant verification and his Aadhaar card. I agree with Appellant that his XXXX-month residence in Uttar Pradesh is not determinative.\n[23] On the issue of whether he is a secondary or important target, consistent with some recent decisions of the Federal Court,17 I find that the heart of the issue is whether the Appellant's name is in databases available to the police that would identify him as a criminal or militant. As noted above the Appellant testified that he does not have a criminal record.\n[24] The objective evidence is that the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network System (CCTNS) database records the information collected on police forms 18 and the Zonal Integrated Police Network (ZIPNET) collects information about heinous cases and most wanted criminals. 19 The Appellant did not present any documentary evidence to demonstrate that his detention was recorded i.e., in any of the reports listed above that are entered in the CCTNS database. In his immigration form the Appellant states, \"Indian police illegally detained me and falsely accused me\" and that he is currently charged with an offence or subject of any criminal proceedings.20 By definition an illegal detention would not be recorded.\n[25] There are mandatory requirements in many cities, including Bengaluru, for individuals to register their residential location with the local police station or for landlords to provide information to authorities about their tenants. This system is intended to \"detect criminal background, if any, and maintain a database of people living in a particular area.\"21\n[26] The objective evidence on communication between police offices across the country indicates there is little connectivity between police forces in India, that they are virtually unconnected islands,22 and there is \"little inter-state police communication except for cases of major crimes likes smuggling, terrorism and some high profile organized crime.\"23 Other objective evidence on surveillance by state authorities says that the police do not have the resources to identify all those who rent property and information about tenants is very limited, citing Mumbai as an example. 24\n[27] The most recent objective evidence on police databases and criminal tracking25, referenced by the RPD, cites a professor of criminal justice at the Indiana University Bloomington who says that since a national Indian database does not exist, tenant verification is \"extremely limited\" due to the volume of workers who have migrated to large cities. It also quotes LN Rao, a former deputy commissioner of police in Delhi, as stating that tenant verification is \"'done only for the psychological satisfaction, not for actual background check ... the cops don't make any effort to follow up with the concerned police station of other states.'\"26\n[28] The Appellant's testimony that tenant verification is done on the basis of the Aadhaar identity card is not corroborated by the objective evidence which says that \"Aadhaar is an identifier and not a profiling tool.\"27 The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) operates the Aadhaar card system and explains it in the following manner:28\n... When someone gives one's Aadhaar number to a service provider,\nonly the individual's Aadhaar number, biometrics and name are sent to\nUIDAI in a request for verification of identity, to which UIDAI replies\nby either a \"[y]es\" or a \"[n]o\" and by sending, on some occasions, the\nindividual's \"name, address, picture, etc.\" available with UIDAI back to the service provider.\n[29] Objective evidence says that more than 99% of the Indian population over 18 has an Aadhar number that can be used in any system that needs to establish the identity of a resident.29 The same objective evidence cites a number of sources that it is impossible for the government to track people using the card.30 The issuing authority, UIDAI, made a statement to the Supreme Court of India that it is \"technically impossible\" for the government to track \"or spy on\" citizens using the data collected by the Aadhaar.31 The objective evidence also reports that the law in India does not permit \"the use of or access to Aadhaar biometric data for criminal investigation\"32 except in the case of national security following a High Court Judicial Order. 33\n[30] The Appellant testified that the agent who procured his visa for Canada also bribed a security officer at the airport.34 When the RPD asked the Appellant why he did not reference this in his original or amended BOC, he said that he was not aware that it was important information he should include in his story.35 The RPD did not find the Appellant's explanation credible.36 The Appellant does not make any submissions about this finding.\n[31] The objective documentary evidence reports that India has developed standardized security screening procedures for all airports in the country. More specifically the evidence states that, \"all Indian citizens leaving the country from any of the airports, seaports and land ports are required to go through exhaustive security and verification processes, including computerized examination of their passports.\"37 The RPD found that if the police wanted the Appellant he would have been stopped at the airport.\n[32] The objective evidence38 indicates that at the international airport in Delhi,39 the Appellant would have undergone an immigration check by the Bureau of Immigration (BOI). The BOI reports that Indian nationals must fill a departure card at the time of departure, including their name, date of birth, passport number, and address in India. Air India states that \"embarkation forms should be duly filled out and submitted to customs and immigration authorities before boarding the aircraft.\"40 The objective evidence identifies four components to the immigration check: checking of passport\/travel documents to identify the holder and to look out for cases of forgery; ascertain the eligibility of the holder either to leave or enter India, as per existing rules and regulations; computer confirmation in clearing passengers; and a health check.41\n[33] There is also objective evidence42 that:\n[e]very incoming and outgoing traveller's personal details are matched against the MHA [Ministry of Home Affairs] originated and BoI [Bureau of Immigration] enhanced [Black List (BL)\/Look Out Circular (LOC)] database, available at the [Immigration Check Post] counter through the Immigration Control System (ICS). [The] [i]mmigration official either swipes travellers' passport[s] in [the] Passport Reading Machine (PRM) or directly enters travellers' personal details into the ICS to obtain results. (India n.d., 26)\n[34] \"LOCs are issued to alert immigration authorities to prevent any 'absconding criminal or person required by enforcement authorities' from leaving the country\" and \"at present there are nearly 30,00 individuals, including foreign nationals, in the blacklist database of the MHA.\" The evidence about the effectiveness of the exit controls is mixed. One source cited said, \"a person being investigated or sought by the authorities in India would not be able to depart through normal exit controls,\"43 while another source is quoted as saying, \"most persons under investigation would not be prevented from departing the country\" unless they are high-profile cases.44\n[35] I find that the Appellant would have been required to provide the required documentation, undergo an immigration check by the Indian immigration authorities prior to boarding his aircraft, and, on a balance of probabilities, he would have been stopped if his name was actually on a police list as a criminal or militant.\n[36] The onus is on the Appellant to show that he does not have an IFA in Bengaluru. I find that the Appellant did not present sufficient credible evidence to meet his burden to demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that he will be subject to persecution (on a \"serious possibility\" standard), or a section 97 danger or risk (on a \"more likely than not\" standard) in Bengaluru from the Haryana police.\nSecond prong of the IFA test: it is not objectively unreasonable or unduly harsh for the Appellant to relocate to the proposed IFAs\n[37] The issue is whether it would be reasonable, in all the Appellant's circumstances, for him to relocate to the proposed IFA in Bengaluru. As a starting point, the Federal Court of Appeal has held that there is:\n...a very high threshold for the unreasonableness test. It requires nothing less than the existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant in travelling or temporarily relocating to a safe area. In addition, it requires actual and concrete evidence of such conditions. The absence of relatives in a safe place, whether taken alone or in conjunction with other factors, can only amount to such condition if it meets that threshold, that is to say if it establishes that, as a result, a claimant's life or safety would be jeopardized. This is in sharp contrast with undue hardship resulting from loss of employment, loss of status, reduction in quality of life, loss of aspirations, loss of beloved ones and frustration of one's wishes and expectations.45\nThe Court has reiterated the importance of not lowering that threshold.46\n[38] When the RPD asked the Appellant, if he put aside his fear of the police, whether there was any other reason why he could not live in Bengaluru he replied, \"if I'm not afraid of the police, yes, I can live.\"47\n[39] The RPD found that Bengaluru is an ethnically diverse city, the region is the leader in economic growth in India, it is an important cultural and economic hub and it is served by an international airport. The RPD noted that the Appellant is a skilled worker and concluded, on a balance of probabilities, that it would be easy for him to find a suitable job in the region of Bengaluru.\n[40] The RPD concluded that the Appellant has a safe and reasonable IFA in Bengaluru. The Appellant does not make any submissions on the second prong of the IFA test.\n[41] I note that Article 19 of the constitution grants citizens the right to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India.48 \"In general, a person fearing state and non-state (including 'rogue' state) actors is likely to be able to internally relocate to another area of India.\"49\n[42] I find that the Appellant has not established with concrete evidence that the conditions in Bengaluru are such that they would jeopardize his life and safety. I find in all the circumstances, including circumstances particular to the Appellant, that conditions in Bengaluru are such that it would not be unreasonable or unduly harsh for the Appellant to seek refuge there.\nCONCLUSION\n[43] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\n\"Susan Brown\"\nSusan Brown\nDecember 13, 2021\nDate\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\nRAD File \/ Dossier de la SAR : MC1-02509\nRAD.25.02 (August 20, 2021)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n2\nImmigration and Refugee\nBoard of Canada\nRefugee Appeal Division\nCommission de l'immigration et du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 du Canada\nSection d'appel des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s\nRAD.25.02 (August 20, 2021)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n",

I am unable to confirm or set aside the RPD decision without holding a new hearing and reviewing the evidence that was submitted to the RPD regarding the issue of whether the appellant has a well-founded fear of persecution or whether he would be subjected to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment should he have to return to his country of citizenship, Peru.\n[6] Pursuant to subsection 111(1) of the IRPA, the RAD refers this matter to the RPD for re-determination by a differently constituted panel.\nBACKGROUND\n[7] The appellant alleged before the RPD that he fears his stepfather and mother in Peru, his country of citizenship, as well as in the United States. He alleged that at age five he went to live in Florida, United States. He alleged that he was taken there by his mother, who lived there with her spouse, the appellant's stepfather. He stated that he was continually threatened and physically and sexually abused by his stepfather since that time. The appellant alleged that he told his mother about these abuses at some point, and that the Florida child welfare services were informed, but that he subsequently had to withdraw his complaint with the authorities as a result of his mother's pressure.\n[8] The appellant alleged that, in 2011, he informed his aunt, whom he was visiting in Quebec at the time, of the abuses he suffered at the hands of his stepfather. When he visited that aunt in XXXXX 2013, he decided to claim refugee protection in Canada based on her advice.\n[9] The RPD found the appellant's allegations credible, although it determined that he was excluded from refugee protection under Article 1E of the Convention and under section 98 of the IRPA, and, accordingly, rejected his claim for refugee protection. The RPD determined that, at the time of the hearing, the appellant had permanent resident status in the United States, which gave him a substantially similar status to nationals from that country. The RPD also determined that the appellant did not establish that the American authorities would be unable to provide him with adequate protection. As a result, the RPD did not consider the fear of return to Peru that the appellant alleged before the panel.\n[10] Before the RAD, the appellant filed a form1 from the United States immigration services entitled \"I-407, Abandonment of Lawful Permanent Resident Status,\" which was completed by him and dated XXXXX, 2013. He alleged that, in view of the fact that he renounced his permanent resident status in the United States on XXXXX, 2013, and based on the criteria set out by the Federal Court of Appeal in Zeng,2 the RPD's analysis regarding his legal status in the United States on the date of the hearing, XXXXX, 2013, is incomplete.\n[11] The appellant also alleged that the RPD should have considered, in light of the evidence establishing the abuse that he experienced in the United States, that there were compelling reasons for him to not be removed to this country.\n[12] For these reasons, the appellant is requesting that the RAD set aside the determination of the RPD and grant him refugee status, or refer this matter to the RPD for re-determination of his claim for refugee protection.\nAdmissibility of new evidence presented on appeal\n[13] The appellant presented the following new evidence on appeal:\n* Exhibit B: Email sent by the appellant to the immigration office in the city of XXXXX, Florida, dated May 21, 2013.\n* Exhibit C: Form I-407, Abandonment of Lawful Permanent Resident Status, dated XXXXX, 2013.\n* Exhibit D: Report of the responding officer at the XXXXX crime victims assistance centre (XXXXX), dated XXXXX, 2013.\n* Exhibit E: Psychosocial report from the Centre XXXXX de la XXXXX et du Centre-du- XXXXX [XXXXX and Central XXXXX centre], dated XXXXX, 2013.\n[14] Subsection 110(4) of the IRPA states that the person who is the subject of the appeal may present only evidence that arose after the rejection of their claim or that was not reasonably available, or that the person could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection.\n[15] There is currently no case law from higher courts with respect to the application of subsection 110(4). However, there is a similar provision in the IRPA that applies to the pre-removal risk assessment (PRRA), namely, paragraph 113(a), which reads as follows:\n113. Consideration of an application for protection shall be as follows:\n(a) an applicant whose claim to refugee protection has been rejected may present only new evidence that arose after the rejection or was not reasonably available, or that the applicant could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection\n[16] Although the provisions are almost identical, and while the functions of the RAD and the PRRA are not the same either, I am nonetheless of the opinion that, because of their similarity, the case law related to the application of paragraph 113(a) also applies, making the necessary adaptations, to subsection 110(4) of the Act.\n[17] The key decision regarding the application of paragraph 113(a) is the Federal Court of Appeal decision in Raza.3 At paragraphs 13 to 15 of Raza, the Honourable Justice explains the criteria and the manner in which new evidence submitted should or should not be considered, as follows:\n[13] ... Paragraph 113(a) asks a number of questions, some expressly and some by necessary implication, about the proposed new evidence. I summarize those questions as follows:\n1. Credibility: Is the evidence credible, considering its sources and the circumstances in which it came into existence? If not, the evidence need not be considered.\n2. Relevance: Is the evidence relevant to the PRRA application, in the sense that it is capable of proving or disproving a fact that is relative to the claim for protection? If not, the evidence need not be considered.\n3. Newness: Is the evidence new in the sense that it is capable of:\n(a) proving the current state of affairs in the country of removal or an event that occurred or a circumstance that arose after the hearing in the RPD, or\n(b) proving a fact that was unknown to the refugee claimant at the time of the RPD hearing, or\n(c) contradicting a finding of fact by the RPD (including a credibility finding)?\nIf not, the evidence need not be considered.\n4. Materiality: Is the evidence material, in the sense that the refugee claim probably would have succeeded if the evidence had been made available to the RPD? If not, the evidence need not be considered.\n5. Express statutory conditions:\n(a) If the evidence is capable of proving only an event that occurred or circumstances that arose prior to the RPD hearing, then has the applicant established either that the evidence was not reasonably available to him or her for presentation at the RPD hearing, or that he or she could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented the evidence at the RPD hearing? If not, the evidence need not be considered.\n(b) If the evidence is capable of proving an event that occurred or circumstances that arose after the RPD hearing, then the evidence must be considered (unless it is rejected because it is not credible, not relevant, not new or not material).\n[14] The first four questions, relating to credibility, relevance, newness and materiality, are necessarily implied from the purpose of paragraph 113(a) within the statutory scheme of the IRPA relating to refugee claims and pre removal risk assessments. The remaining questions are asked expressly by paragraph 113(a).\n[15] I do not suggest that the questions listed above must be asked in any particular order, or that in every case the PRRA officer must ask each question. What is important is that the PRRA officer must consider all evidence that is presented, unless it is excluded on one of the grounds stated in paragraph [13] above.\n[18] Exhibits B and C arose after the hearing was held before the RPD on May 1, 2013. Both of these pieces of evidence were submitted to the RAD for the purpose of establishing that the appellant took steps, following the hearing held before the RPD, to renounce his permanent resident status in the United States. I am satisfied that these two exhibits meet the criteria of subsection 110(4) of the IRPA, as well as the criteria established in Raza. Therefore, I accept these two documents into evidence before the RAD.\n[19] Exhibits D and E were also issued after the date of the hearing on May 1, 2013. Exhibit D is a report by a CAVAC criminologist that specifically describes the appellant's psychological situation. Exhibit E is a psychosocial report by a social worker from the Centre XXXXX de la XXXXX et du Centre-du- XXXXX; having noted the abuses that the appellant experienced, her recommendations include entrusting his custody to his aunt in Canada.\n[20] In his memorandum, the appellant does not state how these two exhibits constitute new evidence. However, after mentioning the submission of these two exhibits, he writes: [translation] \"The decision clearly indicates that, despite the psychological report prepared by XXXXX XXXXX and the evidence as a whole, the Division did not taken into account the negative or psychological effects of the acts of persecution and sexual abuses previously experienced by the child\" (see paragraph 17 of the appellant's memorandum).\n[21] After reading the content of these two exhibits, I nonetheless conclude that neither of them meet the newness criteria stated in Raza, in the sense that they are not capable of proving the current state of affairs in the country of removal or an event that occurred or a circumstance that arose after the hearing of the refugee protection claim; of proving a fact that was unknown at the time of the hearing of his claim; or of contradicting a finding of fact by the RPD. In fact, in my opinion, the appellant's psychological condition was established before the RPD with the submission of Ms. XXXXX psychological report (see the RPD file, pages 115 to 141)-a condition that was not called into question by the RPD and which is therefore not a circumstance or event that took place after the hearing date or that was unknown at the time. I am also of the opinion that Ms. XXXXX report is sufficient to establish that the appellant's psychological condition is essentially the same now as at the hearing that was held before the RPD in May 2013.\n[22] Consequently, I do not accept exhibits D and E in evidence before the RAD.\nDECISION ON WHETHER TO HOLD A HEARING\n[23] Under subsection 110(6) of the IRPA, the RAD may hold a hearing if, in its opinion, the new evidence presented on appeal is admissible and meets the three following criteria: 1) it raises a serious issue with respect to the credibility of the person; 2) it is central to the decision with respect to the refugee protection claim; and 3), if accepted, it would justify allowing or rejecting the refugee protection claim.\n[24] I am of the opinion that a hearing before the RAD need not be held in this case because the new evidence that I admitted does not raise a serious issue with respect to the appellant's credibility. For reasons that will be outlined later, I find that this new evidence changes the legal status of the appellant in the United States, but it does not undermine his credibility.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n[25] The IRPA does not expressly specify the standard of review that the RAD should apply when reviewing RPD decisions, and this standard of review is also not directly established by the case law. In this case, the appellants also did not propose a standard of review in their memorandum.\n[26] In the 2008 Dunsmuir decision,4 the Supreme Court of Canada revisited the foundations of judicial review and the standards of review applicable in various situations. In its attempt to simplify the analysis, the Supreme Court determined that there should now only be two standards of review: correctness and reasonableness.\n[27] While the RAD does not conduct judicial reviews of RPD decisions, but rather acts as an appellate body within the same administrative tribunal, the IRB, I am of the opinion that, in the absence of more direct guidance from higher courts, it is possible to apply to the RAD the principles developed in Dunsmuir.\n[28] At paragraph 51 of its decision in Dunsmuir, the Supreme Court writes that \"...where the legal issues cannot easily be separated from the factual issues generally attract a standard of reasonableness.\"\nHowever, in this case, new evidence was filed before the RAD by the appellant, and the RAD will be required to make its own findings in relation to the new evidence. The RAD will also have to determine the impact of those findings of fact on the RPD's determination and, if necessary, re-assess the reasonableness of the RPD's findings of fact, as well as the application of the law to those facts, in light of the additional evidence received.\n[29] At paragraph 47 of Dunsmuir, the Court states that reasonableness is concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process, but it is also concerned with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law. Judicial deference is therefore required and deference must be given to the decision of the RPD.\n[30] The second error alleged by the appellant regarding the RPD's failure to conduct an analysis of the \"compelling reasons\" under subsection 108(4) of the IRPA is a question of law and is therefore reviewable on the correctness standard. If this analysis has to be conducted, in my opinion, the application of the facts of the case to the criteria in subsection 108(4) is a question of mixed fact and law and therefore reviewable on the reasonableness standard.\n[31] At paragraph 50 of Dunsmuir, the Court stated the following regarding the correctness standard:\nWhen applying the correctness standard, a reviewing court will not show deference to the decision maker's reasoning process; it will rather undertake its own analysis of the question. The analysis will bring the court to decide whether it agrees with the determination of the decision maker; if not, the court will substitute its own view and provide the correct answer. From the outset, the court must ask whether the tribunal's decision was correct.\n[32] However, for reasons that will be outlined later, I will not need to assess whether the RAD erred by failing to analyze the \"compelling reasons\" in this case.\nANALYSIS\n[33] The first issue is whether the new evidence admitted by the RAD has an impact on the RPD determination that the appellant was excluded from protection under Article 1E of the Convention.\n[34] The appellant's argument is not that the RPD erred when it determined him to be excluded, but, rather, as he wrote: [translation] \"Considering the appellant's new situation today, he no longer has a status similar to that of US nationals\" (see paragraph 13 of the appellant's memorandum).\n[35] The RPD applied the correct criteria in its decision in order to determine whether the appellant was excluded under exclusion clause E-those set out in paragraph 28 of the Federal Court of Appeal's reasons in Zeng, which read as follows:\n[28] Considering all relevant factors to the date of the hearing, does the claimant have status, substantially similar to that of its nationals, in the third country? If the answer is yes, the claimant is excluded. If the answer is no, the next question is whether the claimant previously had such status and lost it, or had access to such status and failed to acquire it. If the answer is no, the claimant is not excluded under Article 1E. If the answer is yes, the RPD must consider and balance various factors. These include, but are not limited to, the reason for the loss of status (voluntary or involuntary), whether the claimant could return to the third country, the risk the claimant would face in the home country, Canada's international obligations, and any other relevant facts.\n[36] After weighing the evidence presented before it by the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration and by the appellant, the RPD concluded that the appellant still had permanent resident status in the United States as of the hearing date (see paragraph 28 of the RPD's decision).\n[37] In my opinion, the RPD's decision was reasonable at the time that it was rendered. In my view, the aforementioned criteria set out in Zeng could not be clearer: it is on the date of the hearing that the RPD must determine whether a claimant has a status that is substantially similar to that of nationals in the third country. The RPD determined that, owing to his permanent resident status, the appellant did have a status that is similar to that of citizens of the United States.\n[38] However, in my view, it is on the date of the hearing before the RAD, or on the date it renders its decision if no hearing is held, as in this case, that the RAD must apply the criteria set out by the case law to the appellant's situation, while taking into account the new evidence presented before it, and thereby re-assess the reasonableness of the RPD's findings of fact, as well as the application of the Act to those facts.\n[39] The criteria set out in Zeng in order to determine whether the appellant is currently excluded under clause E are the following:\n1. At the time of these proceedings, does the appellant have a status in the United States that is substantially similar to that of nationals from that country?\n[40] In my view, exhibits B and C, submitted before the RAD, show that the appellant, on a balance of probabilities, no longer has permanent resident status in the United States. Although Exhibit B is simply an email sent by the appellant on XXXXX, 2012, to a United States immigration office in Florida, it still shows the appellant's willingness to renounce his status in that country, and it is part of the steps that he took to that end.\n[41] In my view, Exhibit C has greater probative value with respect to the appellant's loss of status in the United States: it is an official abandonment of permanent residence in the United States form filed by the appellant at the United States consulate in Montr\u00e9al, which was officially received by the Vice-Consul of the United States on XXXXX, 2013. The form states that the appellant voluntarily submitted his resident card to the consulate. It also states that if the appellant were to seek admission to the United States thereafter, he would be brought before an American immigration judge, who would have to determine his admissibility while considering all the statements that the appellant made regarding the abandonment of his status in the United States.\n[42] In my view, the appellant's loss of his permanent resident status in the United States shows, on a balance of probabilities, that, at the time of these proceedings, he does not have a substantially similar status to that of nationals of that country, in particular, the right to return there, and other rights associated with permanent resident status.\n2. Given that the answer to question 1 was no, did the appellant previously have this status?\n[43] In my view, the answer to this question is yes. I found the RPD's decision regarding the appellant's status in the United States to be reasonable at the time that it was made. Also, as mentioned earlier, the appellant is not challenging the reasonableness of the RPD's decision in this regard insomuch as he is alleging that the new evidence filed before the RAD shows that his legal status in the United States has changed since the hearing before the RPD.\n3. Given that the answer to the second question was yes, in weighing various factors, such as the reason for the loss of status (voluntary or involuntary), whether the appellant could return to the third country, the risk he would face in his country of origin, Canada's international obligations, and all the other relevant facts, is the appellant nonetheless excluded under clause E?\n[44] In my opinion, in this case, there is no doubt that the appellant voluntarily renounced his permanent resident status in the United States; more importantly, he did so after receiving the RPD's decision excluding him from protection because of his legal status in the United States in order to somehow counter that RPD decision.\n[45] This voluntary renunciation of permanent residence in the United States could be held against the appellant. However, in my view, this is a special case: first, because of the appellant's young age and, second, because the appellant credibly established that he had been persecuted at the hands of his stepfather in the United States. The RPD did not question the appellant's allegations, but instead determined that, in his case, he did not establish that the protection offered by the United States would not be adequate. The psychological consequences of the events experienced by the appellant in the United States are also reported in the psychological report submitted before the RPD, which concludes emphatically on the negative consequences for the appellant (see the RPD record, pages 136 and 137).\n[46] In my opinion, this is not a matter of the refugee protection claimant in this case renouncing his permanent resident status in a third country where he was not alleging a fear of returning in order to find a way around the application of exclusion clause E and to possibly remain in Canada.\n[47] In my view, the appellant in this case, given his young age, could have been removed to the United States to the people who persecuted him in the past, and the practical steps he would have to take to obtain protection, again because of his age and his psychological state, could be difficult, and he had valid reasons to voluntarily renounce his permanent resident status in the United States.\n[48] For these reasons, and because this is a special case, the other criteria mentioned above need not be assessed in order to conclude that, as of the date of these proceedings, the appellant does not have a status in the United States that is substantially similar to that of nationals from that country. Consequently, he is not excluded under Article 1E of the Convention.\n[49] The second issue is whether the RPD erred by failing to analyze, faced with the appellant's potential return to the United States, whether he demonstrated that there would be compelling reasons for which he could refuse to seek the protection of the United States under paragraph 108(1)(e) and subsection 108(4) of the Act, which read as follows:\n108. (1) A claim for refugee protection shall be rejected, and a person is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection, in any of the following circumstances:\n...\n(e) the reasons for which the person sought refugee protection have ceased to exist.\n(4) Paragraph (1)(e) does not apply to a person who establishes that there are compelling reasons arising out of previous persecution, torture, treatment or punishment for refusing to avail themselves of the protection of the country which they left, or outside of which they remained, due to such previous persecution, torture, treatment or punishment.\n[50] In view of my finding that the appellant is not excluded under clause E, and that he cannot therefore be removed to the United States, it is no longer necessary or relevant to determine whether the concept of \"compelling reasons\" applies in his case, regarding a possible return to the United States.\nREMEDIES\n[51] I conclude that the RPD's determination is wrong in fact and in law, considering the new evidence. I am unable to confirm or set aside the determination of the RPD without hearing evidence that was presented to the RPD on whether the appellant has a well-founded fear of persecution or would be subjected to a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment should he return to his country of citizenship, Peru.\n[52] Pursuant to subsection 111(1) of the IRPA, the RAD refers the matter to the RPD for re-determination by a differently constituted panel.\n[53] The appeal is allowed.\nNormand Leduc\nNormand Leduc\nOctober 31, 2013\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\nREFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION \/ CLAIMANT'S APPEAL \/ MINOR \/ DOMESTIC VIOLENCE \/ SEXUAL ABUSE \/ EXCLUSION \/ ART. 1E \/ PERMANENT RESIDENT \/ NEW EVIDENCE \/ LOSS OF PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS \/ MALE \/ REFER THE MATTER \/ PERU \/ UNITED STATES\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n1\nRAD.25.02 (April 9, 2013)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\nRAD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SAR :\nMB3-02701\n14\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] The Appellants, XXXX XXXX (the principal Appellant) and XXXX XXXX (the associate Appellant), citizens of India, allegedly fear a drug mafia and corrupt authorities. The Refugee Protection Division (RPD), denied their claims in a decision dated August 16, 2019, for lack of credibility. The Appellants appeal to the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD), and requests that the matter be referred back to a different panel of the RPD for redetermination.1\nDETERMINATION\n[2] The appeal is dismissed. I confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.2\nSUMMARY OF THE FACTS\n[3] The Appellants are a couple from Punjab state in India. Their problems allegedly began on July 18, 2018, when the principal Appellant attended the police station with his brother and the head of the local village council (the \"Sarpanch\"), to report the leader of a drug mafia. The principal Appellant's brother had recently completed addiction treatment at a drug rehabilitation centre, and the Sarpanch had convinced him to report the drug traffickers to the police. The police, however, were uninterested in filing the complaint, and the Station House Officer (SHO) warned the three men that their lives would be in danger because the head of the drug mafia has connections with politicians.\n[4] The three men then decided to take the issue to the local member of the Punjab Legislative Assembly (MLA), and on August 2, 2018 requested that he instruct the police to take action against the drug mafia. Unfortunately, the MLA also warned them that they should not take any steps against the drug mafia.\n[5] The principal Appellant's brother was allegedly killed on August 25, 2018, and then the Sarpanch was killed exactly a month later on September 25, 2018. The Appellants believe that the drug mafia was behind the murders.\n[6] The Appellants went to file a complaint to the Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP). Instead of helping, however, the SSP accused the Appellants of supporting militants and being involved in anti-national activities. The SHO and the MLA were present at the second meeting with the SSP, which led the Appellants to believe that he was also involved with the drug mafia.\n[7] Following the second meeting with the SSP, the Appellants relocated to the city of Amritsar in Punjab to escape from the agents of harm. They were allegedly found by the Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) on November 27, 2018 and accused of having connections with militants in Jammu and Kashmir. They were released after a twelve-hour interrogation but were told to return the next day.\n[8] Fearing that they would be arrested on false pretenses, the Appellants decided to leave India. They went to Delhi on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018, and left India for Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2019. They filed their claims for refugee protection on February 8, 2019.\nTHE RPD DECISION\n[9] The RPD determined that the Appellants were not credible and denied their claims based on omissions from their Basis of Claim form (BOC), inconsistencies and contradictions in their evidence, and because of their overall inability to answer questions directly.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[10] The Appellants submit a solemn declaration in which they reiterate some of the basic allegations of their claims and outline their attempts at obtaining the police report and death certificate of the principal Appellant's brother.\n[11] New evidence is only admissible before the RAD if it arose after the rejection of the claim, if it was not reasonably available, or if the Appellants could not have reasonably been expected in the circumstances to have presented the evidence at the time of the rejection of their claims.3 In addition to these legislative requirements, under the Federal Court of Appeal decisions in Singh and Raza, admissibility is limited to evidence that is relevant, new, and credible.4\n[12] The solemn declaration does not meet the requirements for admissibility. The RPD member questioned the Appellants about their attempts at obtaining the death certificate and their testimony was similar to the information contained in their solemn declaration. The sole argument in the Appellants' memorandum on the question of the admissibility of this document is that \"the judge was not convinced because she didn't have any documents to prove the murder of his brother.\" Contrary to this submission, however, while the Appellants were questioned about this issue, their failure to submit the death certificate did not form part of the RPD's decision. None of the information contained in the solemn affirmation is new, it did not arise after the denial of the claims, and it was reasonably available to the Appellants. The Appellants could have reasonably been expected to provide this evidence at the time of the denial of their claims - and they indeed did provide it through their testimony to the RPD. The solemn declaration is therefore inadmissible.\n[13] The Appellants' request for an oral hearing before the RAD is denied because the evidence is inadmissible. Hearings before the RAD are limited to circumstances when new evidence which is admissible on appeal raises a serious issue with respect to the Appellants' credibility that is central to the decision, and if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the refugee protection claims.5\nTHE ISSUES\n[14] The determinative issue in this appeal is the Appellants' credibility.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n[15] The standard of correctness applies to this appeal as set out by the Federal Court of Appeal in Huruglica.6 This requires an independent assessment of the refugee claims to determine whether the RPD was correct in its findings and determinations.7 While deference can be afforded to the RPD on specific issues when it enjoys a meaningful advantage over the RAD in making findings of fact or mixed fact and law, such an advantage does not arise in the present case.\nANALYSIS\n[16] After considering the Appellants' arguments and conducting an independent review of the entire record, including the transcript of the proceeding before the RPD, I agree with the RPD that the Appellants are not credible. As will be outlined below, the omissions from the BOC and the inconsistencies in the evidence concern central aspect to the Appellants' claims and therefore undermine their overall credibility.\nThe alleged letter to the government\n[17] I agree with the RPD that the omission of any reference in the BOC to the letter that the Appellants allegedly wrote to the government denouncing the drug mafia and its connections to the authorities, and their inability to fully recount the information contained in the letter or even the person they addressed it to, undermines their credibility.\n[18] The principal Appellant testified that he and his wife were being targeted by the drug mafia because they \"told the SPP and [...] also wrote to the government.\" The Appellants allegedly wrote the letter in September 2018, but they could not fully remember the content of the letter or even who they addressed the letter to in the government.\n[19] After the RPD asked several questions about the content of the letter, the principal Appellant was only able to provide \"that the drug dealers are here and the police is supporting them. [...] And the MLAs are also with them and they are supporting them.\" When asked whether they wrote anything else in the letter, the principal Appellant testified that \"I don't remember.\"\n[20] The RPD correctly rejected the principal Appellant's attempt at attributing the omission of any reference to this letter in the BOC to his friend that helped him write his narrative. The principal Appellant claimed that he mentioned the letter to his friend that helped write the BOC. This explanation is not reasonable because the principal Appellant first testified that his friend read back to him everything he wrote in the BOC. When this was pointed out, the principal Appellant testified that \"when he ... when he read it to me, it was written inside,\" but did not explain its current omission. The Appellants swore at the beginning of the hearing that their BOC was \"complete, true, and correct,\" and they had a representative who could have assisted them to amend the BOC and include information about the alleged letter.\n[21] The omission of any reference to the letter in the BOC and the principal Appellant's inability to fully recount its content or the person he addressed it to is significant because according to his testimony its was one of two steps that he took after his brother and the Sarpanch were murdered. When the principal Appellant was asked why he was being targeted, he testified that it was because he raised his voice by speaking to the SSP and writing to the government. The Appellants did not address this adverse finding by the RPD in their memorandum to the RAD.\nAlleged meeting with the SSP\n[22] The Appellants' inconsistent evidence on their meeting with the SSP also undermines their credibility.\n[23] According to the BOC, the Appellants attended the SPP's office after the two murders to submit a complaint about the collusion of the SHO and the MLA with the drug mafia. The SPP called the Appellants the next day to attend a meeting, which included the SHO and the MLA, and the Appellants were accused of anti-national activities and supporting militants.\n[24] Similar to the BOC, the principal Appellant initially testified that he was called by the SPP to attend the meeting, but then subsequently testified that the SSP told him to \"come back the next day\" while he was submitting his complaint.\n[25] The principal Appellant did not provide an explanation for the inconsistency in his evidence on whether he was called by the SPP to attend the meeting the following day, or whether he was told to attend while he was submitting his complaint. The RPD member specifically asked: \"can you explain the contradiction in your testimony today?\" Instead of providing an explanation, the principal Appellant reiterated that the SPP \"told us to come back tomorrow.\"\n[26] The alleged meeting with the SPP is central to the Appellants' claims, as it represents the cumulation of the various incidents that they experienced, including the murder of the principal Appellant's brother and the Sarpanch. The Appellants claim that they felt the need to flee their village after the meeting to \"save our lives.\" In the circumstances, I agree with the RPD that the inconstancy in the evidence on how the meeting was arranged undermines their credibility. The Appellants did not address this credibility finding in their memorandum to the RAD.\nInconsistent evidence regarding visa application\n[27] Lastly, I also agree with the RPD that the inconsistencies in the evidence about the timing of the Appellants' applications for Canadian visitor visas undermine their credibility.\n[28] The Appellants indicate in the BOC that they were located by the ATS in Amritsar on November 27, 2018, and after a 12-hour interrogation left for Delhi on XXXX XXXX, 2018. In Delhi they found an agent that helped them obtain Canadian visas. According to the principal Appellant's testimony, they coincidentally came across an agent in Delhi on the 29th or 30th of November when they overheard him speaking to someone else in a Gurudwara about obtaining travel documents. They fortunately had their visas with them at the time, and the agent helped them complete applications for Canadian visas that same day.\n[29] Contrary to the Appellants' testimony, the documentary evidence reveals that their completed applications for Canadian visas were received on November 27, 2018. This is inconsistent with both their BOC and their testimony in which they claimed that they were in Amritsar on November 27th, where they were being interrogated by the ATS.\n[30] The Appellants were unable to provide an explanation for the inconsistency. The RPD member specifically asked the Appellants \"how can you explain that you met the agent on the 29th or 30th of November 2018, when according to this form, the agent or whomever applied for your visa, applied on the 27th of November when you were allegedly in Punjab in police custody?\" In response the principal Appellant testified that: \"[w]e don't know how the agent did that.\" The principal Appellant was given two additional opportunities to provide an explanation, and he continued to assert that \"[h]ow can we explain if we don't know ourselves? We don't know how he did that there,\" and \"we don't know anything.\"\n[31] While the Appellants point out in their submission that they were interrogated for twelve hours when they were detained on November 27th, and thus released after midnight on November 28th, this does not help resolve the inconsistency. The evidence in their BOC and testimony that they arrived in Delhi on XXXX XXXXand applied for visas after meeting an agent remains inconsistent with the fact that the visa applications were completed on November 27th.\n[32] This represents more than just an inconsistency with the date that the Appellants applied for Canadian visas, and instead affects the timing of significant parts of their narrative, including their alleged twelve-hour interrogation by the ATS, their relocation to Delhi, and their decision to flee India. I therefore agree with the RPD this inconsistency undermines their overall credibility.\n[33] While the RPD made a number of additional adverse credibility findings, I find that the ones outlined above fully rebut the presumption of the Appellants' truthfulness and undermine their overall credibility because they concern central elements of their claims.8\n[34] Lastly, I do not accept the argument that \"all the minorities in India especially belonging to the Sikh community are persecuted and considered to be the enemy of the state.\" The Appellants have not pointed to any objective evidence in support of their bald assertion. Contrary to this submission, the evidence in the National Documentation Package (NDP), notes that \"Indian federal law provides minority community status to Sikhs, which allows access to government assistance programs, while legislation refers to Sikhs under the same category as Hindus.\"9 Sikhs reside in every Indian state, with the majority residing in Punjab, and \"[a]lmost every major Indian city has a Sikh community.\"10 Moreover, \"since the late 1980s and early 1990s, Sikhs have lived peacefully in India and the majority of Sikhs do not experience societal discrimination or violence.\"11 At most, Sikhs may face instances of \"localized discrimination,\" but \"these matters are usually dealt with by local courts or police.\" None of this evidence supports the Appellants' assertion.\nCONCLUSION\n[35] For the reasons outlined above, I agree with the RPD that the Appellants are not credible and therefore do not face a serious possibility of persecution in India, nor, on a balance of probabilities, a danger of torture, a risk to their lives, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\n[36] The decision of the RPD is confirmed and the appeal is dismissed.12\nJohn Helis\nJohn Helis\nDecember 18, 2020\nDate\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD File \/ Dossier de la SAR : MB9-23576\nMB9-23577\nRAD.25.02 (January, 2020)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n2\nImmigration and Refugee\nBoard of Canada\nRefugee Appeal Division\nCommission de l'immigration\net du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 du Canada\nSection d'appel des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s\nRAD.25.02 (January, 2020)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (the \"Appellant\") is a citizen of Colombia. He is appealing a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) denying his claim for refugee protection.\n[2] The RPD refused the claim on the basis he does not have a nexus to the refugee convention under s.96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), that there is adequate state protection, and that he has a safe and reasonable Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) to Barranquilla in relation to his claim to be a person in need of protection (PIP) under s.97 of the IRPA.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] The appeal is dismissed.\nBACKGROUND\n[4] Between 2004 and 2009, the Appellant worked for a XXXX company, and worked for the same company as his uncle (\"the Uncle\"). In February 2008, the Uncle began receiving threats from armed groups financed by drug traffickers who wanted his help. The Uncle refused.\n[5] On 14 August 2009, the Uncle and the Uncle's daughter were murdered in Cali. The Appellant suspects it to be the same drug traffickers.\n[6] In November 2011, the police arrested four port workers in relation to illegal drugs. Soon afterwards, the Appellant was approached by someone who said he had nothing to do with the seizure of drugs. The man also said that he wanted the Appellant to be careful, and that if he saw anything strange, he shouldn't say anything.\n[7] The next incident happened in August 2017, when a different man approached the Appellant asking for information on a container's route so that it could be used to smuggle drugs. The Appellant refused to help. Later, on 10 August 2017, a container was seized and drugs were found.\n[8] The Appellant experienced more threats, including threats that people knew the Appellant was related to the Uncle. The Appellant and his family began to take steps moving around.\n[9] On 10 January 2018, two armed men claiming to be from the criminal group National Liberation Army (ELN) threatened the Appellant and his family to assist them, warning the Appellant that he would be killed like his Uncle. The Appellant and his family then moved to a different neighbourhood in Buenaventura.\n[10] The Appellant quit his job and left Colombia on XXXX XXXX 2018. The Appellant's family stayed behind in Colombia. He travelled via the United States (US) to Canada where he made his refugee claim. The Appellant's claim was refused by the RPD on the grounds he had a safe and reasonable IFA to Barranquilla.\nADMISSIBILITY OF EVIDENCE SUBMITTED ON APPEAL\n[11] In support of this appeal, the Appellant proposed the admission of the following documents as new evidence:\na) Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) Article \"Colombian ELN rebels claim responsibility for last week's deadly car bomb\" dated 21 January 2019.1\n[12] S.110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)2 provides that the Appellants may present only evidence that arose after the rejection of their claims or that was not reasonably available, or that they could not reasonably have been expected3 in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection. It is for the Appellants to make full and detailed submissions in their Memorandum about how any proposed new evidence meets the requirements of s.110(4) and how that evidence relates to the Appellants.4\n[13] In addition, if the new evidence meets one of the explicit legislative factors in s.110(4), then the second step of the analysis is for the RAD to apply the adapted Raza factors endorsed in Singh.5 In Singh, the Federal Court of Appeal held that the RAD should assess the admissibility of the new evidence for its credibility, relevance and newness. The RAD is not to consider the fourth Raza factor of materiality to the admission of new evidence, which is a consideration for s.110(6) and the request for an oral hearing.6\nCBC article rejected\n[14] The CBC article refers to an attack by the ELN which took place on or around 17 January 2019 at a military installation in Bogota.\n[15] The Appellant submitted that as the event took place after the RPD Decision, the document meets the requirements of s.110(4) of the IRPA.7 No submissions were made in relation to how the Singh and Raza factors are met.\n[16] In assessing the proposed new evidence, I find that as the event in question took place after the RPD rejection, the document does meet the requirements of s.110(4) of the IRPA.\n[17] In relation to the Singh and Raza factors, the article is credible as it comes from a reputable news source and is new in the sense that it relates to an event that did not take place until after the RPD decision.\n[18] However, the attack in question took place in Bogota, whereas the central issue in this case is the ability for the Appellant to relocate to Baranquilla and whether he would be at risk from the ELN there. The fact that the ELN conducted an attack in Bogata is not relevant enough to address the issue of IFA to Baranquilla.\n[19] Furthermore, the target of this ELN attack was a government military installation. The Appellant's allegation of being targeted by the ELN is to do with a refusal to help them, rather than any profile of being a government or military official. The article does nothing to address the issue of the Appellant's personal risk.\n[20] I note that all three Singh and Raza factors need to be met, and if any one of them is not met, the proposed document should be refused, regardless if any of the other factors are met or not. In this case, I find the relevance factor is not met, and therefore I reject the proposed document as new evidence.\nISSUES IN APPEAL\n[21] The Appellant argued the following issues in his appeal:\na) The RPD erred in its analysis relating to who killed the Uncle and its finding that it was speculative the Uncle was killed by the ELN.\nb) The RPD erred in failing to note that Barranquilla is a major port city which is home to drug trafficking operations. Stemming from this, the RPD erred in identifying the agents of persecution, by restricting its finding purely to the ELN and failing to note that they are allied with the Rastrojos who are active in Barranquilla. The RPD therefore also erred in its finding that Barranquilla would constitute a safe and reasonable IFA.\nc) The RPD erred by speculating that the Appellant is no longer of interest to illegal drug organisations because his family have not been approached since the Appellant left Colombia.\nd) The RPD erred in relation to its finding that there is adequate state protection available to the Appellant.\n[22] I find that the determinative issue in this case is IFA to Barranquilla.\nANALYSIS\n[23] I have conducted an independent analysis of the evidence concerned, including reviewing the RPD hearing, as well as considering the Appellant's Memorandum, the RPD Decision, and the Appellant's Basis of Claim (BOC) form as amended amongst other documents.\nNo s.96 Nexus\n[24] Firstly, I note that the Appellant has conceded that he has no nexus to a s.96 Convention ground, and that therefore he is not a refugee under s.96 of the IRPA.\n[25] I note that the Appellant is appealing the RPD decision on the basis he is a person in need of protection under s.97 of the IRPA.\nBaranquilla is a safe IFA\n[26] The RPD has stated that it does not believe the Appellant to be of particular interest to the ELN now, and that as a result, he would be able to internally relocate to Barranquilla. The RPD made reference to the National Documentation Package (NDP) (and I concur, in finding this in Item 7.23 of the 31 April 2018 NDP) saying that the ELN do not have a presence in Barranquilla.\n[27] The Appellant argued that while the ELN may not have their own presence in Barranquilla, the RPD erred by forgetting to take into account that Barranquilla is a major port city with drug operations, and has strong links to the Rastrojos criminal organization, who have a presence in Barranquilla.\n[28] In examining the evidence, I note that while the ELN overall may have links to the Rastrojos, I am not convinced that there is sufficient communication within the ELN, much less with the Rastrojos, that would alert anyone in Barranquilla that the Appellant was wanted by the ELN in Cali.\n[29] Of note, InSight Crime states \"...the ELN has always been characterized by internal power struggles, maniacal leaders and disorganization at the top. It is little surprise then that over the years, the ELN's modus operandi has evolved and increasingly autonomous factions have acted in more criminal than ideological terms.\"\n[30] This indicates that while the ELN at best may have interests in Barranquilla, its \"disorganization and increasing regional autonomy\" would make communication from the Cali ELN faction to anyone in Barranquilla about the Appellant unlikely.\n[31] I also bear in mind this is combined with the fact that the Appellant's family has not been approached by any criminal organization since the Appellant left Colombia. The Appellant has argued that this indicates the ELN know the Appellant has left, and doesn't see any point in approaching the family.\n[32] However, I find this to be overly speculative, and not necessarily logical. Even if the ELN in Cali knew the Appellant had left, it would not stop them from carrying out kidnapping or extortion of the Appellant's family to put pressure on him, in a manner consistent with their other activities.\n[33] In weighing the evidence available, I find it more likely that the Appellant's family has not been approached because the Appellant is no longer of interest to the ELN, and would be of even less interest to any ELN players or other drug groups in Barranquilla. I find that the risk of harm to the Appellant in Barranquilla would at best be a mere possibility, and not rise to the level of balance of probabilities under s.97 of the IRPA.\n[34] While illegal drug activities may take place in Barranquilla, I am not convinced the Appellant would be a specific target if he were to relocate to Barranquilla, and I concur with the RPD's finding that Barranquilla constitutes a safe IFA for the Appellant.\nBarranquilla is a reasonable IFA\n[35] I note that the RPD also gave reasons why Barranquilla constitutes a reasonable IFA for the Appellant, and that these findings were not challenged in this Appeal. There is no obvious error in the RPD's findings and I concur with the RPD's finding that Barranquilla constitutes a reasonable IFA for the Appellant.\nState protection need not be analysed\n[36] As I have upheld the RPD's finding that the Appellant would not be of interest to the ELN or other criminal organisations in Barranquilla, it is not necessary to analyse the issue of state protection.\nCONCLUSION\n[37] Pursuant to s.111(1)(a) of the IRPA, the RPD's decision that the Appellant is neither a refugee nor a person in need of protection is confirmed.\n[38] The appeal is dismissed.\n(signed)\n\"T.

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] The Appellant, XXXX XXXX XXXX, claims to be a citizen of Saint Vincent and claimed refugee protection in Canada based on the risk of persecution and\/or harm that he would face with respect to individuals who allegedly attacked him and would do so again.\n[2] The Appellant's claim for refugee protection was rejected at the Refugee Protection Division (the \"RPD\"). In doing so, the RPD raised credibility concerns with the Appellant's evidence and found that he was not credible in aspects of his evidence central to his claim.\n[3] The Appellant is appealing the RPD's rejection of his refugee claim on the basis that, among other things, the RPD erred in its decision.\nDECISION\n[4] The appeal is dismissed, pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the \"IRPA\").1 The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nBACKGROUND\n[5] The RPD heard the Appellant's refugee claim on April 26, 2019 and rejected it in a written decision that same day. The RPD found that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nANALYSIS\nThe Role of the Refugee Appeal Division (the \"RAD\")\n[6] Jurisprudence provides that the RAD is required to undertake an independent assessment of the evidence and reach its own determination, including as to whether the RPD made the correct decision.2\n[7] Deference is owed to the RPD only where the RPD held a meaningful advantage in assessing evidence.3 In the current case, given the lack of advantage, I see no reason to show deference to the RPD's findings. As such, I have applied a correctness standard and arrived at independent findings and conclusions based upon my assessment of the evidence.4\nNo New Evidence Submitted or Oral Hearing Requested\n[8] The Appellant has not submitted any new evidence to the RAD. Furthermore, the Appellant indicated that he \"requests a hearing for argument regarding laws and facts in this case as a hearing affords a better opportunity to present and respond to arguments\".5 However, a hearing before the RAD is not possible given that no new evidence has been submitted or accepted in this case, pursuant to subsections 110(4) and (6) of IRPA.6\nDeterminative Issues\n[9] Overall, this appeal examines whether the RPD erred in determining that the Appellant would not face a serious possibility of persecution or a risk of harm in Saint Vincent. Ultimately, I agree with the RPD and find its overall determination correct and dismiss the appeal.\n[10] Given that the RPD found no nexus with the Appellant's allegations and Convention grounds, the overarching issue in this case at the RPD was whether, on a balance of probabilities, the Appellant would face a risk of harm in Saint Vincent, pursuant to subsection 97(1) of IRPA (i.e. a risk of death, a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture). In that regard, the RPD determined that the Appellant's evidence was not credible and that ultimately, he is not a person in need of protection.\n[11] As such, the determinative issues at the RPD were nexus and credibility, particularly as this relates to the Appellant's alleged fear and risk of harm regarding criminality, his inconsistent evidence, his lack of corroborating documents to establish the elements of his claim, and his delay in seeking refugee protection in Canada. The same issues are determinative of this appeal at the RAD, notwithstanding my consideration of the arguments and\/or issues raised by the Appellant.\n[12] The issues upon which the Appellant has based his appeal are incorporated within the arguments the Appellant has advanced. These include an assertion by the Appellant that the RPD decision is \"replete with errors of law and fact.\"7 Notwithstanding that I do not agree, I will address all of the Appellant's arguments within my analysis below.\n[13] Ultimately, as noted herein, I find the RPD's overall determination correct and dismiss the appeal.\nThe RPD has not imposed a higher standard of proof on the Appellant\n[14] The Appellant argues that the RPD imposed a higher standard of proof on him by \"requiring proof that he would be persecuted as opposed to the proper test which requires only a reasonable chance or more than a mere possibility of protection\".8 However, this is not correct or true.\n[15] To begin with, the standard of proof upon which evidence is assessed and the legal test to be met are distinct concepts and should not be confused. The standard of proof was correctly applied when the RPD assessed the Appellant's evidence to make factual findings, on a balance of probabilities. In other words, where the RPD found that, on a balance of probabilities, aspects of the Appellant's evidence were not credible, it had applied the correct standard of proof.\n[16] Furthermore, the RPD found no nexus with Convention grounds in this case, given that the Appellant fears criminality in Saint Vincent. Therefore, the RPD assessed the Appellant's refugee claim pursuant to subsection 97(1) of IRPA, and ultimately determined that, on a balance of probabilities, he would not personally face a risk to his life, a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture if he returned to Saint Vincent.9 No requirement of proof regarding persecution or higher standard was imposed by the RPD, as argued by the Appellant.\n[17] As such, I find that the RPD applied the correct legal test with respect to subsection 97(1) of IRPA, and the correct standard of proof in making factual findings. The Appellant's arguments in this regard are unfounded and cannot be accepted.\nThe RPD did not impose an excessive burden on the Appellant\n[18] The Appellant argues that the RPD \"imposed an excessive burden on the appellant...when it requires in its decision that the applicant clarify the delay and inconsistency in making his claim.\"10 However, this is not correct. Where a refugee claimant has delayed making a refugee claim, as the Appellant did during the seven to eight years he was living in Canada without legal status (i.e. 2010-2018), and he only made a refugee claim after being arrested, it is correct for the RPD to seek an explanation regarding this significant delay.\n[19] Additionally, given that credibility was a determinative issue in the Appellant's refugee claim, it is not an error or an imposition of an excessive burden on the Appellant to require him to clarify inconsistencies in his evidence or details surrounding when he came to Canada and when he ultimately made his claim. Nonetheless, the Appellant has not supported his contentions regarding the delay with persuasive medical evidence or documentation. Ultimately, I do not accept the Appellant's arguments in these regards.\nThe RPD did not err in asking the Appellant about the incident upon which his claim is based\n[20] The Appellant submits that:\nThe appellant was ask about the incident in which his claim was based on (35) and the appellant explain that he was injured by XXXX he ran to the police station and was taken to the hospital which was a clinic in the village at the time of the attach, the clinic was in the same village with the police station.11\nHowever, with all due respect, it is unclear what the Appellant's argument is in this submission. Nonetheless, it is correct for the RPD to ask the Appellant about a central incident upon which he is basing his refugee claim to assess his credibility and forward-looking risk.\nThe RPD did not err in its findings on the Appellant's delay in seeking refugee protection\n[21] The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in its assessment of his alleged lack of knowledge about filing a refugee claim, and that he could not have found out about making a claim before the police told him he could do so when they arrested him. Furthermore, the Appellant argues that the RPD had an \"obligation and responsibility to accept the fact the appellant delay was due to the fact that he is highly illiterate and his family was not interested in providing any support for him after his arrival in Canada\".12 However, I do not accept the Appellant's arguments in this regard.\n[22] Given the Appellant's allegations of fear and risk of harm in Saint Vincent, and the extended duration of time he overstayed his initial travel visa and remained in Canada without legal permission to do so, he was therefore at significant risk of being discovered, detained, and deported, and thereby returned to the country which allegedly serves as the site of harm in his claim. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect the Appellant to take steps to find out how he could remain in Canada legally and avoid being returned to Saint Vincent, if he genuinely fears for his life there.\n[23] Moreover, the options and resources available to the Appellant, including with respect to the refugee protection system, are all publicly accessible and discoverable with minimal effort, notwithstanding the Appellant's alleged level of literacy. Furthermore, there is no persuasive evidence before me to support the Appellant's allegations or to establish that, on a balance of probabilities, he is \"highly illiterate\";13 that his family did not provide any support for him after his arrival in Canada; and\/or that he could not have contacted or accessed independent sources of assistance and information to address his situation. This includes immigration professionals like the one who has represented him before the RPD and the RAD, and Canadian governmental immigration, refugee, and travel related telephone support lines or websites, among others.14 Altogether, this undermines the Appellant's allegations and arguments and the basis for his refugee claim.15\n[24] Additionally, the Appellant has not adequately explained what is meant by the obligation or responsibility that he argues the RPD had to accept his reasoning for the delay in making a refugee claim. Conversely, the RPD has an obligation to assess and analyze refugee claims fairly and impartially and to determine whether refugee claimants are Convention refugees or persons in need of protection. This includes making assessments on the credibility of a claimant's allegations and evidence. The RPD has done that in this case and ultimately found that the Appellant's evidence, including his testimony, was inconsistent and not credible in central aspects of his claim. I agree. Therefore, I do not accept the Appellant's arguments regarding the RPD's related obligation or responsibility and find these to be untenable.\n[25] Furthermore, the Appellant's assertion that the RPD based its decision \"solely on the delay by the appellant\" is incorrect.16 The RPD based its decision largely on the Appellant's credibility or lack thereof, and the Appellant's delay in making a refugee claim was a part of this overall assessment, and served to undermine the Appellant's credibility. I agree with the RPD's findings in this regard.\nThe RPD did not impose a higher standard in assessing the Appellant's refugee claim\n[26] The Appellant argues that he explained to the RPD that he was having difficulty understanding some of the words being used at his hearing, and that the RPD imposed a higher standard in assessing his claim. However, I do not agree. The RPD did not impose a higher standard in assessing the Appellant's claim, nor has the Appellant identified what this higher standard is that was allegedly imposed on him. Nonetheless, as explained above, I find that the RPD applied the correct standard of proof and legal test in assessing the Appellant's refugee claim.\n[27] Moreover, having reviewed the recording of the Appellant's hearing17 at no time during the hearing did the Appellant \"try to explain to the member that he have a problem comprehending some of the words the member was using\" as he has argued on appeal.18 And, the questions being asked and the words the RPD used to formulate these, were straightforward, such that there is no indication before me that the RPD was using unnecessarily complex phrases or terminology.\n[28] Nonetheless, the Appellant was represented by counsel at his hearing, who also did not raise any concerns or objections in this regard. Furthermore, English is the Appellant's first language, and the national language spoken in Saint Vincent, and from my review of the evidence before me, the Appellant appeared to understand the questions he was being asked and to provide responses that accord with the subject matter of the questions being asked.\nThe Appellant has advanced several unsupported submissions\n[29] The Appellant asserts that due to the level of assault he experienced in Saint Vincent he went to the police and filed a report, but that the police never did anything to protect him or arrest anyone in connection with this.19 However, the Appellant has not provided any persuasive evidence to support this contention, including police reports that he allegedly filed, any correspondence with the police in Saint Vincent requesting such reports, or updates regarding their investigative efforts or related responses.\n[30] Furthermore, the NDP for Saint Vincent provides information and contact details regarding requests for police and hospital documentation made from outside the country, which may include enlisting the help of the Saint Vincent Consulate in Canada, or accessing governmental websites and email contacts, all of which could assist with acquiring such documents to support or corroborate allegations of this nature.20\n[31] Therefore, the Appellant's testimony at his hearing that he tried calling the police to request documents but the phone just rang and rang, fails to adequately explain why he has not provided acceptable documents to establish the core elements of his refugee claim or the steps he has taken to obtain them, particularly given that the Appellant has been represented by counsel throughout the refugee claim and appeal process.\n[32] Additionally, the Appellant asserted in his memorandum that the RPD refuses to accept his allegations of being shot in the foot on his way to get treatment for the assault he suffered; and that the RPD refuses to accept that he never recovered from the violent attack and injuries he suffered in Saint Vincent.21 However, the Appellant is not clearly identifying an error that the RPD has made in this regard. Nonetheless, I have considered whether the RPD's assessment of the Appellant's credibility in not accepting his allegations is flawed, and ultimately find that it is not. As the RPD noted, the Appellant's evidence is inconsistent and untrustworthy, and he has not provided persuasive evidence to corroborate his allegations, particularly as this relates to a forward-looking risk that he would face in Saint Vincent should he return there.\n[33] Additionally, the Appellant is asserting that very few people recover from the type of attack he suffered in Saint Vincent, that it is difficult to estimate how long a recovery might take, and that he did not receive any special treatment, counselling, or therapy.22 However, the Appellant has not presented any medical evidence to support his allegations or assertions. Furthermore, he is advancing an argument that the RPD finding that the Appellant's seven year delay in making a refugee claim undermines his credibility is not based on \"therapeutic evidence\" establishing that the Appellant would have recovered during that time.23 In other words, the Appellant appears to be arguing that he did not seek refugee protection during the seven years he was in Canada because he had not recovered from the attacks he experienced in Saint Vincent causing him to flee. Nonetheless, he has not provided any \"therapeutic evidence\" that he refers to.\n[34] Ultimately, I do not accept this argument. The Appellant has not presented any persuasive evidence to corroborate his allegations or arguments in this regard, and as the Federal Court has noted, it is reasonable to expect that individuals will seek refugee protection at their first available opportunity and that not doing so undermines the basis for their claim. Furthermore, the Federal Court has recognized that a delay in claiming refugee protection is an important factor for assessing a claimant's credibility, given that individuals who fear for their lives can be reasonably expected to seek refugee protection without unreasonable delay.\n[35] In Garcia, Justice Near stated that:\nDelay in making a refugee claim \"is not a decisive factor in itself\" but it is a \"relevant element which the tribunal may take into account in assessing both the statements and the actions and deeds of a claimant\" (Huerta v Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1993), 157 NR 225, [1993] FCJ no 271 (CA)). It is reasonable to expect that the Applicants would make a claim at the first possible opportunity (see Jeune v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2009 FC 835, [2009] FCJ no 965 at para 15).\nRecent jurisprudence also suggests that while the delay itself is not determinative, it \"may, in the right circumstances, constitute sufficient grounds upon which to dismiss a claim\" (Duarte v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2003 FC 988, [2003] FCJ no 1259 at para 14). Absent a satisfactory explanation for the delay, it \"can be fatal to such claim, even where the credibility of an applicant's claims has not otherwise been challenged\" (Velez v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2010 FC 923, [2011] FCJ no 1138 at para 28).24\nCredibility findings made by the RPD are correct and material to the Appellant's claim\n[36] The Appellant argues that the RPD made adverse credibility findings regarding his unclear and inconsistent testimony and that in doing so it should not \"microscopically comb evidence searching for errors and inconsistencies\" and should be \"particularly careful in rejecting sworn evidence on the basis of \"after the fact\" reading of transcript.\"25 However, I find that in this case the RPD's credibility findings were not microscopic, but rather pertain to material aspects of the Appellant's refugee claim, including inconsistencies and contradictions with the Appellant's core allegations and evidence, which he was unable to reasonably explain.\n[37] Furthermore, I have reviewed the RPD hearing recording and the evidence presented by the Appellant in his refugee claim and ultimately agree with the RPD's findings regarding the Appellant's credibility. These include findings with respect to: (1) his significant delay in making a refugee claim despite being at risk of deportation from Canada for several years; (2) inconsistent evidence regarding his knowledge of the identity of his alleged attacker in Saint Vincent; (3) evidence omitted from his Basis of Claim regarding his alleged theory as to the central motive of his attackers in seeking his father; (4) inconsistent evidence regarding allegations that his mother told him the attackers are still present in his village; and (5) a lack of corroborative evidence including documents to establish the core elements of his claim.26\n[38] I find that all of the above findings are central to the Appellant's refugee claim and are correct. Moreover, the Appellant's explanations in these regards fail to reasonably explain or overcome related concerns with his credibility or trustworthiness, severely undermining the basis for his claim and appeal.\nOverall Findings in this Appeal\n[39] Ultimately, pursuant to my independent assessment in this appeal, I find that the RPD is correct in its overall conclusion that the Appellant failed to provide credible and trustworthy evidence regarding his allegations of forward looking harm in Saint Vincent should he return there, and in doing so he provided inconsistent, and confusing evidence. Moreover, I do not find the Appellant's arguments persuasive with respect to overcoming these concerns, or to establishing his alleged risk of harm.\n[40] Ultimately, the Appellant failed to establish that he would face a serious possibility of persecution or that, on a balance of probabilities, he would face a risk to life, a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture if he were to return to Saint Vincent. Therefore, this appeal must be dismissed.\nCONCLUSION\n[41] Pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of IRPA, I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(Signed)\nG.

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (the \"Appellant\") is a citizen of Iraq and is appealing a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) denying his claim for refugee protection. The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in its credibility assessment and erred in assessing the documentary evidence that his profile places him at risk upon return to Iraq. After careful review of the evidence in the record, the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) finds that the Appellant is not credible and has not established he faces a forward-looking risk of persecution if he returned to Iraq.\n[2] For the reasons provided below, I am dismissing the appeal.\nBACKGROUND\n[3] The Appellant alleges that he is an Iraqi citizen, but that he was born in Kuwait and resided there most of his life. He does not have Kuwaiti citizenship and his residence status has expired in Kuwait. The Appellant alleges that in 2010 during a visit to Basra, Iraq, he was shot at. He also alleges that he has been threatened by his uncle and his mother's extended family members. If he returns to Iraq, the Appellant fears he will be killed by Shia militias because he is Sunni or because he is perceived to be Kuwaiti. He also fears he will be harmed or killed by his uncle or his mother's extended family.\n[4] In XXXX 2014, the Appellant went to the United States (U.S.) to study. After his Kuwaiti residence expired and his father informed him he could no longer afford his schooling, the Appellant filed a claim for asylum in September 2015. In March 2017, the Appellant abandoned his U.S. asylum claim and came to Canada. He made an inland refugee claim on March 20, 2017. Further details are provided in his Basis of Claim (BOC) Form, and his testimony at the RPD hearing.1\nThe RPD's Decision\n[5] The Appellant had a refugee determination hearing on May 4, 2018. In a written decision issued on June 8, 2018, the RPD rejected the claim. The RPD panel found the Appellant lacking in credibility and subjective fear, and that he was not at risk in Iraq from his family members, nor was he at risk as a perceived Kuwaiti or because of his Sunni faith. Therefore, the RPD concluded that the Appellant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution on a Convention ground, or that he would not personally be subjected to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or a danger of torture upon return to Iraq.\nROLE OF THE RAD\n[6] For questions of fact, mixed fact and law, and law, the RAD applies the standard of correctness. In assessing findings involving the credibility of oral testimony, I may defer if I find that the RPD had a meaningful advantage in the circumstances.2 Reasons will be provided in my analysis if I find that the RPD had a meaningful advantage.\nISSUES IN APPEAL\n[7] The Appellant argues the following issues in his appeal:\na. The RPD erred in its credibility assessment;3\nb. The RPD erred in its subjective fear assessment;4 and,\nc. The RPD erred in its assessment of the documentary evidence.5\nANALYSIS\nCredibility\nThe U.S. Asylum Claim\nThe Appellant's Argument\n[8] The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in its credibility finding based on discrepancies between the Appellant's U.S. and Canadian asylum claims, despite his explanations. The Appellant submits that the RPD's finding is unintelligible because the RPD gave him \"credit\" for outlining some of the inconsistencies in his BOC with the information in his U.S. asylum application. The Appellant claims that the RPD giving him \"credit\" supports his credibility, yet the RPD then rejects his explanation as to why these errors were made in his original U.S. asylum claim. Therefore, the RPD seemingly accepts that his U.S. claim includes false information, but rejects the reasons behind them.\n[9] The Appellant argues he is not at fault for the errors in his U.S. asylum claim because of his personal circumstances. When these circumstances are considered, the Appellant submits that it shows he was not at fault for the inconsistencies. His personal circumstances that should be considered include: his young age of 19 at the time of his asylum application, he was alone in a new country, surrounded by a foreign language and his English language skills were \"severely compromised\", he knew nothing of the asylum process, and deferred to those who were competent in the field to advise him. By divulging the potentially damaging information to the RPD about the inconsistencies, and by removing the exaggerations or embellishments in his BOC, this supports his credibility by being honest.\nThe RAD's Assessment\n[10] I reject the Appellant's argument and find the RPD did not err. While the RPD's use of the word \"credit\" was perhaps not the best choice to describe the Appellant's disclosure in the circumstances, I do not agree that the Appellant's credibility was confirmed simply because he chose to disclose the inconsistencies between his U.S. claim and his BOC before his hearing. The Appellant's disclosure of the inconsistencies does not make him a more credible witness, nor does his BOC narrative become the accurate account of his allegations, especially considering the RPD found his explanation for the inconsistencies to be lacking in credibility, and as a result, found he knowingly provided false information in his U.S. asylum application. Essentially, given the inconsistencies between the two documents, and the Appellant's incredible explanation, the RPD and the RAD are in the position of not knowing what is true in either document.\n[11] Having reviewed the Appellant's explanation for the inconsistencies between his U.S. asylum documents and his BOC narrative, I agree with the RPD's assessment and find that the Appellant's explanation was not credible. Therefore, I agree with the RPD that the Appellant knowingly provided false information in his U.S. asylum form, which undermines his credibility.\n[12] I do not accept the Appellant's explanation that his circumstances explain the inconsistencies. First, it is easy to blame former counsel for the mistakes in one's claim; however, the evidence before me indicates on a balance of probabilities that the Appellant would have been aware of the content of his U.S. asylum documents at the time it was completed. This is demonstrated by the Appellant signing the U.S. asylum documents and it is indicated that the contents of the document were fully interpreted to him in his native language. As such, his limited English capabilities are not a reasonable explanation. That said, I reject his submission that his English abilities were \"severely compromised\". The Appellant studied at a college in the U.S. in the English language; he worked at a gas station in the U.S., which would have required him to communicate in the English language; he was able to research how to make a claim for protection in the U.S.; he did not require an interpreter for his interview with the immigration officer when he arrived in Canada; and, his BOC form and Canadian refugee application documents state that he can communicate in the English language.6 Considering the Appellant possesses some English language abilities, it is unlikely that the Appellant, upon reviewing his U.S. asylum documents five months after their completion, was unaware of the errors in his U.S. asylum documents and made no efforts to amend the erroneous content.\n[13] Second, I do not accept the Appellant's explanation that his young age and that he \"knew nothing of the asylum process\" explain the inconsistencies in his U.S. and Canada refugee application forms. The Appellant is not a minor child. Rather, he was 19 years of age at the time and was able to reside and study independently in the U.S. since November 2014. In addition, the Appellant states in his BOC narrative that it took a long time, but he managed to research how to make a claim for protection in the U.S. and identified a lawyer to assist him. In order to initiate his asylum claim in the U.S., he travelled 15 hours from North Carolina to Michigan in order to meet with his lawyer and commence an asylum claim.\n[14] For the above reasons, I find the Appellant does not provide a credible explanation for the erroneous and inconsistent information in his U.S. asylum documents, and that he knowingly provided false information in his U.S. asylum documents. Therefore, I find the RPD did not err and I find this undermines his credibility.\nBrother in Iraq\nThe Appellant's Argument\n[15] The Appellant further argues that it was an error for the RPD to later impugn his credibility on the basis that he failed to outline \"all\" of the inconsistencies in his U.S. application, when he failed to correct information in his U.S. asylum document that his brother was living in Iraq. The Appellant submits that he provided an adequate overview of the major inconsistencies in his U.S. asylum claim, so it is clear from his BOC narrative that there were other discrepancies omitted. In his case, he argues there was no reason for the RPD to attack his credibility on the grounds that not every detail was included in his original refugee claim. By finding based on the U.S. asylum claim that his brother continued to reside in Iraq, even though his BOC stated otherwise, the RPD's decision lacks transparency and intelligibility because earlier the RPD accepted that there were mistakes in the U.S. application form, but later concludes that a selective portion of it regarding his brother's whereabouts was factually correct.\n[16] Had the RPD accepted his explanation for the information in his U.S. asylum file, it is reasonable to infer that he would have found the Appellant credible. In addition, the RPD did not have enough evidence before it to discredit the Appellant's credibility.\nThe RAD's Assessment\n[17] I reject the Appellant's argument and find the RPD did not err. The fact that the Appellant failed to also mention in his BOC that his U.S. asylum document was also incorrect regarding the whereabouts of his brother, does not detract from the RPD's finding. I also note the RPD did not conclude that all of the information in his U.S. asylum documents were false, but that he provided false information in his U.S. asylum documents that undermined his credibility. It is still open to the RPD to make additional credibility findings based on additional inconsistencies in his documents, and it could not be inferred from the Appellant's BOC that there were other errors in his U.S. asylum application.\n[18] Regardless, in this instance the Appellant indicates in his U.S. asylum documents that his brother XXXX resides in Basra, Iraq. This is inconsistent with his testimony at the RPD and his BOC that since 2010, only his eldest brother XXXX returned to Iraq, which he did in 2016, but for only one day. When the RPD put the inconsistency to the Appellant at the RPD hearing, he explained that he \"thinks it is a mistake\". I find the Appellant fails to provide a reasonable explanation for the inconsistency. His response that he \"thinks it is a mistake\" is ambiguous as to whether or not it was actually a mistake. Furthermore, for the reasons provided above, the Appellant's explanation for errors in his U.S. asylum documents due to blaming former counsel and his lack of English are not credible. The Appellant cannot simply blame his former counsel after the fact without any evidence beyond a general assertion that it was a mistake.7 I find it unlikely that the Appellant, who alleges to fear returning to Iraq on the basis of his Sunni and Kuwaiti identity, would have mistakenly indicated that his Sunni brother was in Iraq if he was not. He provides no evidence about how and why it was a \"mistake\". Therefore, I find that the inconsistencies between when, how long, and which brother returned to Basra undermines his credibility. I further find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant's brother XXXX was residing in Iraq in September 2015 as indicated in his U.S. asylum application.\nUncontested Credibility Findings\n[19] With respect to the Appellant's argument that the RPD's credibility findings about the U.S. asylum claim are insufficient to uphold its credibility findings, I respectfully disagree. In fact, the RPD made other credibility findings that are uncontested in this appeal. Specifically, the RPD found that the Appellant's allegation that he has been threatened by his uncle in Iraq was lacking in credibility. Considering the Appellant does not contest this finding, I see no reason to interfere with it. It is correct and based on the evidence in the record. The Appellant failed to mention these threats in his testimony about who he feared in Iraq, even though he mentioned this in his BOC that his uncle threatened him if he returned to Iraq. The Appellant was also unable to clearly state when such threats ended. I find a negative credibility finding is warranted based on the Appellant's failure to mention his fear in his testimony and his non-responsive testimony at the RPD hearing about being threatened by his uncle.\n[20] Furthermore, the RPD found that the Appellant failed to establish with credible and trustworthy evidence, other aspects of his claim. This includes the alleged shooting in 2010 and that his mother's family would harm him if he returned to Iraq. Since the Appellant does not contest these findings either, I see no reason to interfere with them. They are correct and based on the evidence in the record. Having reviewed the record, I concur for the same reasons as those provided by the RPD that the Appellant has not established crucial aspects of his refugee claim.\nSunni Surname\nThe Appellant's Argument\n[21] The Appellant argues that the lack of objective evidence does not negate the fact that his surname is well-known as a Sunni name. He submits his oral testimony and BOC narrative should be accepted on this point, since there is no evidence to the contrary and the presumption of truthfulness should stand.\nThe RAD's Assessment\n[22] I reject the Appellant's argument and find the RPD did not err. The Appellant makes a simple assertion that he would be identified as Sunni because he has a well-known last name, which would identify him as Sunni. He provides no corroborating documents about whether his last name is well-known in Iraq. The RPD noted that there was no objective evidence in the National Documentation Package (NDP), nor were there documents provided by the Appellant to support that he has a well-known Sunni last name. I agree with the RPD that the Appellant provides insufficient evidence to support his profile based on his bald assertion that he would be identified as Sunni based on his last name.8\n[23] Furthermore, the Appellant advances this argument to establish his profile based on his alleged interactions with soldiers at a checkpoint, where he and his brother claimed soldiers were disinterested in their claim that they were shot at. The Appellant claims they were disinterested once the soldiers reviewed their ID cards. However, I find the Appellant's allegation that they were disinterested based on his last name to be speculative. There is no indication in the Appellant's description of his interaction with the soldiers that they noticed he had a Sunni name. First, his ID card does not state that he is Sunni. Second, the soldiers did not say anything to indicate they viewed them as Sunni. In fact, the soldiers encouraged them to go to a hospital and report the shooting to a police station. Finally, the RPD observed, and I agree, that it was not surprising that there was little the soldiers could do about the shooting incident. Since there was no ongoing attack at the time, there were no suspects, and the Appellant and his brother did not know who shot at them or why. I find the RPD's analysis of the shooting incident and the Appellant's allegation that he was treated differently because of his Sunni name to be correct and based on the evidence in the record.\n[24] For the above reasons, I find that the Appellant has not established with sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence that people in Iraq would be able to identify him as Sunni based on his \"well-known\" last name.\nSubjective Fear\nThe Appellant's Argument\n[25] The Appellant argues that it was an error to impugn his subjective fear on the grounds that he abandoned his asylum claim in the U.S. The Appellant submits that the number of refugee claimants crossing into Canada via the U.S. is enough to demonstrate that asylum seekers are fearful of the political climate in the U.S. and that the anti-Muslim and anti-Arab policies are enough to create a fear for claimants. He claims that the abandonment of his U.S. asylum claim is indicative of his subjective fear of being removed to Iraq. Even though there was no guarantee that his claim in Canada would be accepted, he believed he had a better chance than in the U.S. and this was a reasonable course of action.\nThe RAD's Assessment\n[26] I find it is not necessary to assess whether the RPD erred in its subjective fear assessment. Assuming without deciding that the RPD did err, this is not determinative and does not affect the disposition of the appeal.\nWell-founded Fear of Persecution\nThe Appellant's Argument\n[27] The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in finding that he could safely return to Basra. He submits that the presence and influence of Shia militias in the province, his profile as a long-term Kuwaiti resident, and his lack of support in Iraq establish a risk upon return to Iraq.\n[28] The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in its assessment of the documentary evidence in several respects. First, the Appellant submits that Basra, where his family originates from, is of no relevance to the issue of whether he can return there, as they have lived outside of Iraq for most of their lives, and therefore, they are of no help should he return there. Second, it was irrelevant whether the Appellant was born in XXXX, which is not the case, as he was born in Kuwait and his birth certificate and BOC narrative indicate this. Third, as indicated in his BOC narrative, his brother was not living in Basra and this was an error included in the U.S. asylum application and should have no bearing on whether or not he would be at risk if removed to Iraq. Fourth, there is no evidence to support the RPD's assertion that his uncle lives in Basra without difficulty. Since he and his father have no relationship with his uncle, he is unable to provide any recent information related to his uncle's treatment as a Sunni in Basra. The absence of such information cannot be used to support that his uncle has not faced harm, threats, or mistreatment due to his religion as a Sunni. Fifth, the Appellant argues that he explained that he has no ties to his extended family in Basra and his immediate family remains in Kuwait, and therefore, his familial or tribal links will be unhelpful or be able to provide support to him upon return to Basra. Finally, the Appellant argues the RPD ignored an abundance of objective documentary evidence that identifies Iraq as unsafe for Sunnis, particularly those of the Appellant's profile, that being he has never lived in Iraq, lived his entire life in Kuwait, he has no support network in Iraq, he is a young Sunni man of fighting age, all of which place him at risk of serious harm upon return to Iraq.\nThe RAD's Assessment\n[29] I have reviewed the objective evidence in the NDP, as well as the objective documents provided by the Appellant and find the RPD did not err in its conclusion on the Appellant's risk profile. The Appellant has not established a forward-looking risk of persecution upon return to Iraq.\nReturn to Basra\n[30] First, I reject the Appellant's argument that the RPD should not have assessed his risk upon return based on the city of Basra. The fact that his family has resided in Kuwait most of his life does not negate the fact that the Appellant's allegations link him and his family as originating from Basra. The Appellant claims that his family is from Basra, including both of his parents and his extended family. In addition, he indicates that when he and his family returned to Iraq, they returned to Basra. I also note that on the Appellant's U.S. asylum documents he indicates that he resided in Basra from 1996 to 2002.9 Finally, contrary to the Appellant's submission, I have found above that the Appellant's brother has resided in Basra in recent years, and there is no indication that he has faced any difficulties in residing there. Therefore, I find it was not an error for the RPD to assess his objective risk of return to Basra, Iraq.\nSupport Network in Iraq\n[31] Second, I reject the Appellant's argument that he possesses a heightened risk profile due to having no support network in Iraq. The Appellant has not established that he does not have a support network in Basra. In addition, the Appellant's brother has recently resided in Basra, without any indication of facing difficulties. The Appellant's brother possesses the same familial support structures as him. In addition, I note that although the Appellant contends that he no longer is in communication with his uncle in Basra, his allegations of threats of harm from the uncle were not credibly established. Furthermore, while the objective evidence indicates that relocation to the Southern part of Iraq, including Basra, without familial, tribal or political networks could face difficulty assimilating into the community, Iraqis who have sought asylum overseas have returned to southern Iraq without significant difficulty.10 Therefore, I find that the Appellant has not established he would face difficulties due to a lack of a support network should he return to Basra, Iraq.\nPerceived as a Kuwaiti\n[32] Third, the Appellant has not established that a profile of having resided in Kuwait for a substantial amount of time establishes a risk upon return to Iraq. In this regard, I observe that the Appellant does not contest the RPD's assessment of the risk based on being perceived as a Kuwaiti. Considering the Appellant does not contest this finding and the objective evidence relied on by the RPD in assessing his risk as a perceived Kuwaiti, I see no reason to interfere with it; it is correct and based on the evidence in the record. Nowhere does the documentary evidence suggest that Kuwaitis or those perceived to be Kuwaiti have been mistreated in Iraq based on their country of origin. One would expect that if they were, the documentary evidence would mention this. On the contrary, the documentation shows that the relationship between the Iraqis and Kuwaitis have improved significantly in recent years. Moreover, the RPD's finding is buttressed by the fact that the Appellant's allegation that people in Iraq would be able to know he is from Kuwait because of his accent, is contradicted by the information in his U.S. asylum document, which states that he has an Iraqi dialect.11 I find the Appellant has not established that he would be perceived as Kuwaiti placing him at risk upon return.\nYouth\n[33] Third, with respect to his allegation that he is a young man, the Appellant points to no documentary evidence showing that he is at heightened risk of harm as a young Sunni man returning to Basra. I have reviewed the NDP and the evidence provided by the Appellant and there is no objective evidence for this assertion that his age of 22 establishes a risk profile, such as risk of forced recruitment. While I have seen documentary evidence about children possessing a risk profile and that militias and ISIS forcibly recruit children to do various tasks, including using them as suicide bombers,12 the Appellant, as a 22 year old man, is not similarly situated. I could find no support that as a young Sunni man he would be forcibly recruited into Sunni militias in Iraq or more likely be targeted on that basis.\nSunni Profile\n[34] I have reviewed the documents cited by the Appellant in his memorandum stating that Sunnis are at risk in Iraq. However, in my view these do not undermine the RPD's assessment of the objective documentary evidence. The passages relied on by the Appellant can be distinguished in two respects. First, these passages note the need to assess one's profile based on their personal circumstances other than their Sunni faith, which I have done above and found the Appellant has not established factors heightening his profile. Second, the documents cited by the Appellant about the risk to Sunnis, largely refer to the risk in areas of Iraq that the Appellant does not originate, nor an area that he would be returning to. Specifically, these documents refer to the risk to Sunnis fleeing territories controlled by ISIS and where the government believes persons are involved in terrorist activities. These are persons fleeing areas in disputed areas of Central and Northern Iraq, rather than Southern Iraq which is more secure.13\n[35] Generally, the security situation in Southern Iraq, and in particular Basra, is described with crime being a growing concern as well as tribal violence, while less of a concern is sectarian violence. Item 1.19 states that:\n5.17 Southern Iraq (including Basra, Karbala, Wasit, Qadisiyah, Maisan, Dhi War, Muthanna and Najaf provinces) has been and remains more secure than other parts of the country, although recent reports suggest a deterioration of law and order in Basra. Generalised criminality occurs, but at a lower level than in Baghdad. Intra-Shia violence between different Shia armed groups occurs in southern Iraq and is influenced by political and \/ or criminal factors. Credible in-country contacts suggest that the risk of being caught up in intra-Shia violence is predominantly borne by those who are actively involved in a militia or tribal group.\n5.18 A wide range of ethnic and religious minority groups reside in southern Iraq. The overwhelming majority is Shia, although there are approximately 400,000 Sunnis (in-country contacts suggest that the number of Sunnis may have since declined), as well as Iraqis of African descent, Christians and Sabaean-Mandeans. While ongoing conflict has seen religiously mixed areas becoming more mono-religious, usually Shia or Sunni, in-country contacts claim that tolerance of religious minorities remains higher in southern Iraq than in central Iraq.14\n[36] This is corroborated by information from the U.K. Home Office, which states that there are a few reports that Sunnis experience human rights abuses at the hands of Shia militia or unknown perpetrators in the southern governorates, but it does not appear to form part of a consistent or systematic risk to Sunnis. It goes on to state that in general Sunnis in the southern governorates are not subject to treatment which would be persecutory or cause serious harm. However, decision-makers must consider whether there are particular factors specific to the person which would place them at real risk.15 The onus is on the person to demonstrate this, and I have found above that he has not established there are particular factors placing him at real risk.\n[37] The Crime and Safety Report for Basra further states that while inter-sectarian tensions exist in Basra, there has been little religiously motivated inter-sectarian violence aside from ISIS activities. Religious minorities complain of governance, legal, and commercial grievances but have not spotlighted violent acts against their communities.16\n[38] I have also reviewed the documentary evidence with a particular eye on specific incidences of violence involving Sunnis in Basra, where the Appellant is from. Groups active in Southern Iraq since 2011 include several Shia militia, which typically target USF, engage in kidnapping, extortion, oil smuggling, rocket attacks against U.S. diplomatic and security personnel in Basra, and target profiles of Baathists, security personnel, government officials, political and religious rivals, and collaborators of the U.S.17 The documents also mention that Al-Qaida and ISIS\/ISIL have a small presence in Basra, but the evidence indicates that they target Shiites and civilians at large.18\n[39] The documentation also mentions that the south of Iraq is quieter than the rest of the country, but there have been a number of IED attacks by ISIS\/ISIL leading to civilian casualties in Basra among other southern cities. ISIL claimed responsibility for all these attacks. Including a suicide bomber in 2016 in central Basra with busy shops, restaurants and offices - killing six civilians and wounding others. Also in April 2016, a suicide bomber detonated an explosive belt inside a restaurant, on the highway between Basra and Nasiriya.19 These attacks do not appear to have targeted Sunnis specifically, but civilians generally. With regard to specific attacks on Sunnis in Basra, the documents make reference to Sunni imams and religious leaders, and individuals looking to \"settle scores\" with political\/religious rivals and tribal disputes involving kidnappings.20 As well, one document mentions a young Sunni man found in Basra with his throat cut, the abduction of Sunni men accused of ties with Al-Qaida after being released from prison, and a Quran reciter (religious figure) shot outside his home.21 Other documents about attacks in Basra refer to attempted murder of judges hearing terror charges and the targeting of a journalist,22 as well as the targeting of perceived LBGT persons.23 None of these profiles the Appellant shares.\n[40] I observe that the Appellant's documents submitted in support of his objective risk refers to 19 Sunnis being killed in Basra. However, it is unclear based on these purported killings that they were killed because they were Sunni. There is no elaboration of the circumstance of these deaths and whether they just happened to be members of the Sunni community who were killed.24 As a result, I give this document limited weight to establishing a serious possibility of persecution for Sunnis in Basra. With respect to the Appellant's citation that government officials used religion as a determining factor in employment decisions, I agree that this is discriminatory, but does not amount to persecution, especially in light of evidence that Sunnis are still represented in government, and the above cited documentary evidence does not foreclose the ability of the Appellant to find employment in the private sector.25 As such, I find this information on religious profiling in employment does not amount to persecution.\n[41] Finally, Basra is a large city with over a million inhabitants,26 and there is a Sunni community there.27 Even though there is a Shia majority in Basra, his Sunni brother was able to reside there without any apparent difficulties. His brother is similarly-situated as he would have been in his mid-20s when he resided there, is Sunni, and has the same familial network as the Appellant. Moreover, the Appellant has a Sunni uncle who has resided in Basra throughout his life, also without apparent difficulties. While the Appellant argues that his uncle and his father cut ties and had a falling out, so he is unaware whether his uncle has experienced difficulties in Basra on account of his Sunni identity, I do not fully accept this evidence. Based on the Appellant's evidence, his family was in regular contact with his uncle at least until 2015 when there was a falling out. Until 2015, the Appellant's family made regular trips to Basra and his father communicated regularly with his uncle about the sale of some land in Basra. At the very least, I believe that had the Appellant's uncle faced any difficulties in Basra on account of his Sunni identity prior to 2015, the Appellant would have heard about it.\n[42] Having reviewed the totality of the objective evidence about the risk to the Appellant, I find that there is a possibility of persecution, but not a serious possibility of persecution if the Appellant returned to Iraq. While there are some examples of Sunnis being mistreated in Basra, the preponderance of the evidence shows that sectarian violence on the basis of his Sunni faith would not rise to the level of serious possibility of persecution. In coming to this conclusion, I find the Appellant has not established that his personal circumstances of having resided in Kuwait most of his life, his youth, or his lack of a support network in Basra heightens his risk profile along with his Sunni identity. The specific examples of individuals harmed in Basra appear to be the civilian population generally, which is a generalized risk, or Sunni individuals who possess other characteristics the Appellant does not share. For these reasons, I find the Appellant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\nCONCLUSION\n[43] After conducting its own analysis of the entire record, the RAD finds that the RPD did not err in its credibility findings or in its assessment of the documentary evidence. As a result, the RPD's final determination that the Appellant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection is correct. Therefore, I must dismiss the appeal.\nDETERMINATION OF THE APPEAL\n[44] The RAD dismisses the appeal and confirms the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection, pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).28\n(signed)\n\"G.

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (the \"appellant\"), a citizen of Colombia, appeals a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (the \"RPD\") rejecting her claim for refugee protection.\nDETERMINATION OF THE APPEAL\n[2] Pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the \"Act\"),1 the Refugee Appeal Division (the \"RAD\") confirms the determination of the RPD, namely, that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is neither a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Act nor a person in need of protection pursuant to section 97 of the Act. This appeal is therefore dismissed.\nBACKGROUND\n[3] The appellant fears persecution at the hands of her ex-common-law husband, XXXX XXXX XXXX. Mr. XXXX XXXX was working for the XXXX XXXX when he was arrested for extortion and he was incarcerated for almost five years. While in prison the appellant's husband requested her to retrieve a delivery from some unknown persons. However, these persons did not attend the meeting. The appellant later learned that the delivery was a large amount of money and that her husband was now accusing her of stealing this money from him. When her husband was released from prison he was physically abusive towards the appellant. The appellant's husband threatened to kill her and would not let her see her son.\n[4] The appellant left the family home and began to live in a number of other places. However, her husband was able to locate her in these locations. The appellant left Colombia in XXXX or XXXX 2011 travelling by air from Bogota, Colombia to Mexico City. She remained in Mexico before travelling to the United States in XXXX 2011. She remained in the United States until travelling to Canada on XXXX 2013.\n[5] The appellant initiated her refugee claim with the Canada Border Services Agency in Vancouver on March 12, 2013.\n[6] The RPD heard the appellant's refugee protection claim on August 13, 2013. The RPD's reasons for the decision were delivered orally with written reasons and a Notice of Decision dated September 10, 2013.\n[7] The appellant was represented at her RPD hearing by different legal counsel than for this appeal.\n[8] The RPD's written reasons dated September 10, 2013, stated that the appellant's case for refugee protection was rejected. The determinative issue in this claim was credibility.\nSubmissions\n[9] The appellant's submissions identify the following grounds for this appeal: whether the RPD Member has failed to consider relevant evidence on an issue before making adverse credibility findings.\n[10] The appellant has requested that the RAD, under subsection 111(b) of the Act, set aside the determination of the RPD and substitute a determination that the appellant is a Convention refugee or person in need of protection, or in the alternative, refer the matter back to a different Member of the RPD for redetermination.\n[11] Counsel for the appellant has submitted that the standard of review in this appeal should be reasonableness for issues of fact and mixed law and fact. For the reasons given below, I agree with this submission of counsel.\n[12] The Minister has not intervened in this appeal.\nConsideration of New Evidence\n[13] No new evidence has been submitted in support of this appeal.\nApplication for an Oral Hearing\n[14] The appellant has requested an oral hearing pursuant to subsection 110(6) of the Act.\n[15] Subsection 110(3) of the Act requires that the RAD proceed without a hearing, on the basis of the RPD Record, while allowing the RAD to accept documentary evidence and submissions from the Minister and the appellant.\n[16] According to subsection 110(6), the RAD may hold a hearing if, in its opinion, there is documentary evidence referred to in subsection 110(3) that raises a serious issue with respect to the credibility of the appellant, that is central to the RPD decision, and that, if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the refugee protection claim.\n[17] When read together, subsections 110(3), (4), and (6) establish that the RAD must not hold a hearing in an appeal such as this unless there is new evidence,2 in which case the RAD may hold a hearing if that new evidence raises a serious issue with respect to the credibility of the appellant, is central to the RPD decision, and that, if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the refugee protection claim.\n[18] As discussed above, no new evidence has been submitted in support of this appeal. As such, the RAD must proceed without a hearing in this appeal.\nStandard of Review\n[19] Although the Act sets out grounds for appeal as well as possible remedies, it does not specify the standard of review to be applied by the RAD.\n[20] In Dunsmuir,3 the Supreme Court of Canada considered the foundations of judicial review and the applicable standards of review, concluding that there are two standards of review, correctness and reasonableness. Dunsmuir has limited applicability to the RAD, however, which is not a reviewing court but rather an administrative appellate body. In Khosa,4 the Supreme Court gave broad deference to a tribunal's interpretation of its own statute but again, this was not specifically in the context of an appeals tribunal reviewing the decision of a tribunal of first instance. As the RAD is a statutory creation, the standard of review must be extracted from the legislation.\n[21] I find that the issues raised in this appeal as to credibility are issues of fact.\n[22] In Newton,5 the Alberta Court of Appeal, having considered Dunsmuir and other jurisprudence, considered the standard of review to be applied by an appellate administrative tribunal to a decision of a lower tribunal. The Alberta Court's analysis is therefore relevant in the context of the RAD, which has considered the factors set out in Newton.\n[23] The Newton6 factors deal with the standard of review to be applied by an appellate administrative tribunal to the decision of an administrative tribunal of first instance, such as is the case with the RPD and RAD. Based on the guidance in Newton, the RAD focused on the factors listed below to determine the standard of review. The contextual approach to assessing which factors are most appropriate in setting the standard of review has been established in Khosa.7 The most significant factors to consider in establishing the standard of review of a decision by a tribunal of first instance by an appellate tribunal are:\n* the respective roles of the RPD and RAD in the context of the Act;\n* the expertise and advantageous position of the RPD Member compared to that of the RAD; and\n* the nature of the question in issue.\n[24] Both the RPD and the RAD derive their jurisdiction from and interpret the same home statute: the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Subsection 162(1) of the Act gives each Division, including the RPD, \"in respect of proceedings brought before it under this Act, sole and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine all questions of law and fact, including questions of jurisdiction.\" The RAD has been given the supervisory jurisdiction to decide appeals of RPD decisions related to refugee protection on questions of law, of fact, or of mixed law and fact.8 The level of deference which the RAD provides to the RPD depends on the questions at issue as addressed above.\n[25] The presence of a right of appeal does not warrant a correctness standard of review given the prescribed relationship between the RPD and RAD, and the limits imposed on the RAD in the Act.\n[26] The RAD finds that the RPD is to be provided with deference on questions of fact as it relates to the assessment of the claim for protection. The RPD is a tribunal of first instance which has been given the authority in the Act to make a decision to accept or reject a claim for protection.9 RPD Members have expertise in interpreting and applying the Act, as well as are experts in assessing claims based on country conditions. The RPD must conduct a hearing10 and assesses the totality of the evidence, including evidence related to the credibility of the appellant and witnesses, after it has had an opportunity to see the appellant, hear his testimony and question him.\n[27] In contrast to the RPD's authority to assess a claim for protection, the Act limits the RAD's ability to gather and consider evidence. The RAD is not a tribunal of first instance but exists to review the decision made by the RPD. The RAD must proceed without a hearing on the basis of the Record, submissions by the parties, and new evidence.11 Appeals to the RAD are party-driven and do not provide appellants an opportunity to have their claims heard de novo. The RAD's authority to hold hearings is limited to evidence that arose after the rejection of the claim or that was not reasonably available, or that the person could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection.12 Hearings are also limited to only specific issues (serious credibility issues) which are directed by the RAD.13\n[28] Given that the RPD has held a hearing on the totality of the evidence and given that the RPD has heard from the appellant directly at a hearing, the RPD is in the best position to assess the credibility of the appellant and to make findings on issues of fact related to the claim. This position is consistent with Newton at paragraph 82 where it indicates:\nThe [Refugee Appeal Division] is not a tribunal of first instance, and cannot simply ignore the proceedings before the presiding officer and the conclusions reached by him.14\n[29] Newton concludes that: \"a decision on such questions of fact by the presiding officer, as the tribunal of first instance, are entitled to deference. Unless the findings of fact are unreasonable, the [Refugee Appeal Division] should not interfere\".15 Newton adopts the definition of \"reasonableness\" in Dunsmuir. Reasonableness is concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process of the RPD; and that the RPD decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law.16\n[30] For the reasons outlined above, the RAD has afforded a considerable level of deference to RPD findings on questions of fact in this claim and will consider whether the findings of fact raised in this appeal meet the reasonableness test.\nAnalysis of the Merits of the Appeal\n[31] I will now turn to the specific submissions by the appellant as to errors allegedly made by the RPD.\n[32] Counsel submits that the non-governmental organization (NGO) office's support letter (page 96 of the Appellant's Record) was accompanied by a medical\/dental verification from Dr. XXXX XXXX (dentist) on page 99 of the Appellant's Record stating that he treated her XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as a result of trauma to her. In his reasons, the RPD Member referred to the lack of outside corroboration from the NGO of the appellant's allegations that she would have reported to them. Counsel submits that the dentist's letter provides such outside corroboration.\n[33] I note from the NGO's letter that they refer to incidents that happened to the appellant in XXXX 2010 while the dentist's letter refers to treatment due to trauma that was performed in XXXX 2010. It is therefore unclear that there is any link to the alleged abuse reported by the appellant to the NGO and the dental work she required. The RPD Member in his reasons stated that the credibility issues he identified in his reasons outweighed the evidentiary value of both the general country condition documents and the support letter provided by the NGO. Based on the totality of the evidence, I find this conclusion to be reasonable.\n[34] Counsel submits that the second document provided by the appellant verified the conviction and sentence of her common-law husband. The report from the Republic of Colombia Supreme Judicial Council (pages 101-106 of the Appellant's Record) allegedly verifies that her common law husband, XXXX XXXX XXXX was convicted and his legal proceedings were handled by the \"Specialized Prosecutor's office, anti-extortion and kidnapping unit, sixth chamber second criminal court specialized Bogota Circuit Supreme Court of Justice Bogota\".\n[35] However, I note that the report indicates that the offence of her ex-common law husband was in relation to \"Violation Law 30 of 1986\", that he received a conditional suspension of sentence and that the \"Type of Process\" was \"against public health\". There is no indication in this document that he had been charged with extortion or had been sentenced to any prison time. The appellant has not provided any documentation as to what constitutes an offence under law 30 of 1986. I note that item 7.1 of the country documents in the Immigration and Refugee Board's National Documentation Package for Colombia refers to 1986 legislation referred to as the \"National Statute on Drugs\" intended to prosecute drug-related illegal conduct.17 While it is unclear if the ex-common law husband's offence was related to this law, the imposition of a suspended sentence does not indicate a serious crime had been committed. This document also does not support key elements of the appellant's story if her ex-common-law husband had not in fact been imprisoned. The transcript provided in pages 6-45 of the Appellant's Record indicates there was no examination by the RDP Member or counsel for the appellant about this document. While this document was not referred to in the RPD decision, it does not mean that the RPD Member ignored it as a simple review of its contents indicates it fails to support the appellant's allegations.\n[36] In summary and based on the totality of the evidence, I find that the RPD Member's credibility findings were reasonable. The RPD Member has not misstated the evidence in coming to his credibility findings. Having considered all the evidence, I find that these reasons do fall within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law.\nREMEDY\n[37] For all these reasons, I confirm the determination of the RPD, namely, that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. This appeal is therefore dismissed.\n(signed)\n\"Douglas Fortney\"\nDouglas Fortney\nJanuary 8, 2014\nDate\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SAR : VB3-02197\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, a citizen of Haiti, is appealing against the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) dated February 20, 2018.\n[2] Ms. XXXX XXXX alleges that she fears for her life after suffering three attacks in Haiti. After the 2010 earthquake, criminals allegedly entered her tent in April 2012 asking for $15,000, which she did not give them because she did not have it. Thereafter, she was attacked again in 2012 as she was going to the market, and lastly, she was attacked on a bus in 2014. After obtaining an American visa, Ms. XXXX XXXX left Haiti in June 2014 to settle in the United States with B-2 visitor status. Given that she feared being deported by the American authorities, she arrived in Canada on August 8, 2017, and claimed refugee protection.\n[3] The determinative issue is the appellant's credibility and, in particular, behaviour that is inconsistent with that of someone who is truly afraid for her life.\n[4] The RPD found that her testimony was not trustworthy with respect to the essential elements of her refugee protection claim, and I agree with this finding.\n[5] The appeal is dismissed. Ms. XXXX XXXX was not consistent with respect to the alleged facts. Her testimony is full of contradictions. The most important element is the inconsistency between returning to Haiti three times and the alleged fear, indicating behaviour that is inconsistent with that of someone who truly fears for her life.\nANALYSIS\n[6] The RPD made four findings with respect to Ms. XXXX XXXX credibility before finding that her testimony was not trustworthy.\n* She did not credibly confirm the dates of travel or the number of times that she returned to Haiti;\n* The returns to Haiti and her testimony about what she did in Haiti establish a behaviour that is inconsistent with that of someone who truly fears for her life;\n* She did not seek asylum in the United States during the nearly three years she was in that country;\n* She testified that she did not have the financial means to get her daughters out of Haiti, although she was able to obtain at least three round-trip airplane tickets.\n[7] The RPD also found that there was no gender-based nexus to the Convention because the circumstances described are not similar to those of vulnerable women who are in such circumstances. In addition, there was a lack of subjective fear, given that she returned to Haiti three times.\n[8] Ms. XXXX XXXX explained the inconsistencies and oversights with respect to her trips to Haiti by confusion due to the tense environment that she left behind. She explained the inconsistencies concerning her behaviour in Haiti by her character traits and cultural background, which may give the panel the wrong impression. She explained the failure to file a complaint with the police by a lack of confidence in the Haitian police, which is supported by the documentary evidence.1 She explained the failure to seek asylum in the United States by the fact that she believed that the American government was going to offer solutions to regularize people without status.\n[9] I reject all of Ms. XXXX XXXX explanations for the following reasons.\n[10] Ms. XXXX XXXX acknowledged that she has returned to Haiti three times (rather than twice) since 2014 after the RPD confronted her with the dates of the stamps in her passport. She subsequently had difficulty confirming the dates of her trips. She stated that the date of her last departure from Haiti was February XXXX, 2016. In fact, her passport shows that she left Haiti and returned to the United States on XXXX XXXX, 2016. XXXX XXXX, 2016, referred to the validity of the visa for this last trip, as established by the immigration officer.\n[11] Even if Ms. XXXX XXXX became confused while recounting the dates of when she returned to Haiti, this behaviour is still inconsistent with that of someone who truly fears for her life. When confronted by the fact that she returned to Haiti multiple times and that she failed to get her daughters out of a situation she claims to fear, she explained that she did not want to take her daughters away from their studies. I would expect that someone who truly fears for her life would be willing to remove her family from the situation within a reasonable amount of time and ensure that her daughters could continue their studies in the country of refuge. The fact that Ms. XXXX XXXX found it acceptable to prioritize having her daughters continue their studies, instead of taking them out of a dangerous situation, even though she had the means to do so, establishes that the situation that she fears is not sufficiently serious for her to meet the requirements of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). She also mentioned that she did not have the means to get her daughters out of Haiti and that it went against her morals to bring three people to the United States when she herself was receiving assistance. I note that she had the means to travel many times between Elizabeth, NJ, Miami and Haiti, whether she was receiving assistance or not, and also that her daughters were 19 and 21 years old when she left Haiti in 2014 and could have worked to support themselves as Ms. XXXX XXXX does.\n[12] Moreover, the fact that she returned to Haiti numerous times establishes that the situation allowed her to return to the country without her having to truly fear for her life. When confronted about the inconsistency between her returns and the situation that she claimed to fear, she testified that she did not go out and that she sent her daughters because they are younger and more capable. I do not accept the appellant's explanations that her adult daughters needed help to such an extent that she returned to Haiti three times, even though she feared for her life, but that when she was back in Haiti her daughters could go out because they are more capable. This reasoning is inconsistent. Either her daughters are not capable of managing the situation and require help or Ms. XXXX XXXX is not capable and needs her daughters' help.\n[13] Lastly, failing to seek asylum in the United States is not determinative in itself. However, in explaining the steps that she took to regularize her status in the United States, Ms. XXXX XXXX contradicted herself. At around 29:50 of the hearing, she testified that she did not do anything to regularize her status and that she was expecting the American authorities to offer solutions. When confronted about the fact that there is no asylum claim, she mentioned that she went to see the IRS in 2015 to pay taxes on her small income and to be entered into the system. This would ensure that when the American authorities offered to regularize her, she would at least be entered into the system. Later, at around 1:18:00, she testified that she went to see the IRS only when she found out, when she last entered the United States, that she could stay for only 14 days (she entered on January XXXX, 2016, and was given the right to stay until February XXXX, 2016). She stated that she was so upset by this news that within the next 14 days, she went to see the IRS to regularize her status. When confronted about her testimony that she went in 2015, she stated that she had told the basics of her story.\n[14] I do not accept this explanation. I am of the opinion that someone who allegedly decided to regularize her status after an upsetting event would not have confused the two situations. Ms. XXXX XXXX clearly testified that she went to the IRS in 2015 to at least do something to regularize her status before her visa expired, and then, when confronted about the inconsistencies in her last date of return to the United States, she testified that she went to the IRS because she had only two weeks to regularize her status. Ms. XXXX XXXX did not give a satisfactory answer before the RPD to explain this inconsistency and did not address this aspect of her credibility in the arguments presented on appeal. She explained only that the United States may sometimes regularize the status of Haitians who are illegal, which does not account for the inconsistencies noted.\n[15] I will not address all the inconsistencies and contradictions noted in Ms. XXXX XXXX testimony. Having listened to the entire hearing and reviewed the evidence and arguments on the record, the examples that I noted are sufficient for me to confirm the RPD's determination. Ms. XXXX XXXX is not credible with respect to the alleged facts.\n[16] For this reason, it is unnecessary for me to address the arguments concerning the lack of adequate state protection in Haiti.\n[17] Regarding the residual profile, the RPD made no errors.

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (Principal Appellant) and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (Associate Appellants), citizens of Mexico, appealed a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD), dated February 19, 2018, rejecting their claims for refugee protection.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] The Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) dismisses the appeal and confirms the decision of the RPD that the Appellants are neither Convention1 refugees nor persons in need of protection, pursuant to section 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).2\nBACKGROUND AND OVERVIEW OF APPEAL\n[3] The associate adult appellant, who is the husband of the principal appellant, worked as a XXXX XXXX for a business that had franchise operations in Mexico. In this capacity, he was tasked with XXXX an office being run by a woman connected through her husband to the New Juarez cartel. As a result of carrying out this task, he alleges that in XXXX 2013 he was abducted, beaten and robbed by members of the cartel and later extorted.\n[4] In XXXX 2015 someone tried to abduct the minor associate appellant. The appellants allege they moved several times but each time they suspected they had been located by cartel members. The appellants allege their lives are at risk if they return to Mexico.\n[5] The appellants came to Canada in XXXX 2016. They made refugee claims at the Port of Entry (POE). Their refugee claims were heard and rejected by the RPD in an oral decision on February 29, 2018.\nNew Evidence and Oral Hearing\n[6] The appellants have not sought to bring new evidence in this appeal nor have they sought an oral hearing.\nRPD Findings\n[7] The RPD accepted the identity of the appellants as citizens of Mexico. The RPD agreed with the appellants counsel that there was no nexus to the Convention and that the claims would be considered under section 97 (1) of IRPA. The RPD found serious credibility problems with the appellants' evidence and did not find that the appellants had provided sufficient evidence of a credible threat to them in Mexico and consequently rejected their claims for refugee protection.\nAppellant Arguments\n[8] The appellants argue that the RPD erred in its credibility findings and breached a principal of natural justice in rendering its decision.\nANALYSIS\n[9] With respect to questions of fact and mixed fact and law, I have applied the standard of correctness as per Huruglica.3 When reviewing the RPD decision, I am required to independently determine whether the RPD was correct in relation to each alleged error of law, fact or mixed fact and law. I may defer to the RPD's credibility assessment of oral testimony, if I find that the RPD had a meaningful advantage in the circumstances. Reasons will be provided in my analysis if I find that the RPD had meaningful advantage.\n[10] It is the persons claiming refugee protection and not the RPD or the RAD that bears the onus of establishing the need for refugee protection. It is the responsibility of the RPD or the RAD to weigh the documentary and testimonial evidence and to draw conclusions as to whether the evidence is sufficient to establish the appellants' allegations.\n[11] A refugee claimant's sworn evidence is presumed to be true unless there are valid reasons to doubt its truthfulness.4\n[12] I agree with the RPD conclusion that there are reasons to doubt the truthfulness of the appellants. However, I will begin my independent analysis by first reviewing the appellants' argument that procedural fairness has been breached in this case.\nWas there a breach of procedural fairness?\n[13] The appellants argue that there has been a reasonable apprehension of bias and breach of procedural fairness because the RPD panel delivered its \"lengthy and detailed\" oral decision \"less than one hour\" following counsel's representations and that the Board had made a \"pre-determined\" decision.5\n[14] The material evidence provided by the appellant to establish a reasonable apprehension of bias is that the reasons for the rejection of the appellants' claims were exactly the same as those that appeared in the transcript of the reasons that was produced some weeks later. The appellants argue that this evidence indicates that the RPD panel \"read its reasons directly from a previously prepared document.\"6 The appellants further argue that this case was complicated and this factor supports their contention that it is not reasonable that the RPD panel could have prepared such a detailed decision in the time taken.\n[15] I do not find that the appellants have met the onus of establishing the existence of a reasonable apprehension of bias and breach of natural justice. The test for reasonable apprehension of bias can be found in the dissent of de Grandpr\u00e9 J. in Committee for Justice and Liberty v. National Energy Board[19] and as followed in Satiacum.[20]\nWhat would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically-and having thought the matter through-conclude? Would he think that it is more likely than not that [the decision-maker], whether consciously or unconsciously, would decide fairly.\n[16] The bystander test was further defined in a Supreme Court decision, Newfoundland Telephone Co. [21] as: \"Whether a reasonably informed bystander could reasonably perceive bias on the part of an adjudicator.\" The principles and considerations noted above are equally applicable to administrative tribunals, which are presumed to be impartial in their decision making.7\n[17] As the appellants point out in their argument,8 in the Federal Court of Appeal wrote:9\nAn allegation of bias, especially actual and not simply apprehended bias, against a tribunal is a serious allegation. . . . It cannot rest on mere suspicion, pure conjecture, insinuations or mere impressions of an applicant or his counsel. It must be supported by material evidence demonstrating conduct that derogates from the standard.\n[18] Similarly, in Roshid,10 the Federal Court wrote:\nThe question is - what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically, having thought the matter through, conclude? The grounds must be substantial and the test should not be related to the very sensitive or scrupulous conscience.\n[19] I do not find that the appellants have provided the material evidence necessary to meet the test articulated in the aforementioned cases. The fact that there was little or no change between the transcript provided to the appellants and the oral reasons delivered at the hearing does not establish that the RPD panel's decision was pre-determined. It simply establishes that what the RPD panel said orally on the record was faithfully transcribed.\n[20] I also do not agree with the appellants that these were complicated claims or that the reasons for decision were either lengthy or complex. The allegations of the appellants were simply that they feared generalized violence and that following an incident where the associate appellant was kidnapped and assaulted, he began then stopped providing extortion money to the criminals. He then suspected those he feared were tracking him and his family in Mexico over a period of several years. There was little documentation that directly addressed the appellants' allegations. It is reasonable to assume that the RPD considers similar non-complex allegations from refugee claimants from a variety of countries on a regular basis and that a great many such cases are decided with oral reasons containing either a positive or negative decision based on the evidence.\n[21] The audio recording and the transcript of the proceeding indicates that the RPD panel's questions to the appellants during the hearing were clear, direct and respectful. The appellants had a full opportunity to answer the panel's questions and their counsel had ample opportunity to question his clients and to make representations. In its reasons for decision the RPD panel included references to the appellants' responses to the panel's questions which could not have been known in advance of the hearing.11 In reviewing the oral decision I find the RPD considered the appellant's allegations and the evidence submitted without having prejudged the case.\n[22] The RPD panel Member may have referred to her notes during the delivery of her reasons but I find no evidence that the reasons were \"read.\" I find the RPD panel had an obligation to diligently prepare in advance of the hearing and it is reasonable that she would have organized her notes during the nearly one hour break following counsel's submissions to assist her in delivering her oral reasons for decision. I do not find the panel's delivery of its reasons for decision orally at the hearing is sufficient by itself to establish an apprehension of bias.12\n[23] I do not find, nor do I believe an informed person, \"viewing the matter realistically and practically\" would conclude that there exists a reasonable apprehension of bias in this case and I find no merit in the appellants' allegations in this regard.13\nOmissions from Port of Entry (POE) Notes\n[24] The RPD did not find that the appellants had provided sufficient trustworthy or reliable evidence of a credible threat to them in Mexico.14 The RPD based its finding primarily on the fact at the POE, neither the principal nor associate adult appellant advised the immigration officer that they fled Mexico after being personally pursued by a criminal cartel for several years or that the associate appellant had been kidnapped, assaulted, extorted and threatened with death. The RPD noted that at the POE the adult appellants only wrote generally about conditions in Mexico in regard to the activities of organized crime. The RPD also noted in its reasons that the appellants had not been truthful with the CBSA officer about their locations in Mexico omitting several residences. I also note that the appellants did not disclose at the POE what they believed was an attempted kidnapping of the minor associate appellant.\n[25] When confronted at the hearing with these omissions the adult principal and associate appellants stated that they were afraid that if they provided this information to the officials at the Canadian border they could be deported and the information could be leaked to the cartel. The RPD panel did not accept the appellants' explanations.\n[26] The appellant argues that the RPD panel was \"over-vigilant\" in its analysis of discrepancies between the POE notes, the BOC and the appellants' testimony.15\n[27] In my independent analysis I do not accept the explanation from the appellants for their failure to disclose their direct experience of being sought by a criminal cartel in Mexico. Notwithstanding the nervousness one might expect to be reasonable in appearing before officials of a foreign government, in my opinion it defies common sense that the appellants would be afraid of being truthful with Canadian border officials if, as they allege, those they fear had engaged \"hitmen\" to kill the associate adult appellant in their country of origin. I find it more likely than not that the appellants deliberately obfuscated their story at the POE and I accordingly draw an adverse inference.\n[28] I find it was open to the RPD panel to challenge the truthfulness of the adult associate appellant's testimonial evidence and the evidence he provided in his amended BOC on the basis of evidence previously given in his POE interview. I concur with the panel's finding that the appellant's explanation that he was too fearful to disclose to the POE official because the officer might leak his information to the cartel is unsatisfactory. The testimony does not adequately explain the omission of material evidence concerning pursuit by a criminal cartel, multiple moves and living in hiding for many years.\n[29] It is reasonable to expect that an individual such as the associate adult appellant, who alleges that he has been abducted, assaulted, extorted and threatened with death by \"hitmen\" from a criminal cartel, would mention that fact in his POE Notes as well as mention that he and his family had changed addresses from 12 to 17 times in 4 years to evade those he fears. It is also reasonable to expect that the attempted kidnapping of the minor associate appellant would be mentioned at the POE given the adult appellants' evidence that they believed the cartel was responsible.\n[30] The Federal Court has stated that:\nIt is well established by the jurisprudence that declarations to immigration authorities at the Port of Entry (POE) may be considered by the Board in order to evaluate a claimant's credibility,16\nand that:\nIt is trite law that statements to immigration authorities at the POE may be considered by the Board in order to evaluate a claimant's credibility and that a person's first story is usually the most genuine, and therefore the one to be believed.\" 17\n[31] The Federal Court has provided a detailed analysis of the issue of omissions from the POE in the Seenivasan decision.18The Court concluded that the purpose of the POE Notes is not to provide a detailed account of the Appellant's story but only to summarize the reasons and allegations as to why the Appellants are seeking refugee protection in Canada. However the credibility issue in this case is not that the POE notes lack the details of the allegations of harm and threats to the appellants but rather that the notes lack any reference whatsoever to these allegations which are central to the refugee claims of the appellants.\n[32] The adult appellants were asked to state at the POE who or what they feared if they should return to Mexico.19 These basic questions are asked to all refugee claimants regardless of their individual circumstances. The information provided by the adult appellants was that they feared general conditions of crime and violence in Mexico. Like the RPD panel, I find that it is reasonable to expect that the appellants, even though they were undoubtedly nervous during their interview, would have mentioned, at least in a general way, the circumstances that led them to flee their country of origin. The kidnapping, assault, extortion and death threat to the associate adult appellant is not a minor detail. According to their testimony these events formed the main reason the appellants are seeking refugee status in Canada.\n[33] In the Seenivasan decision, relying on a number of other Federal Court decisions, the court concluded that the Board may draw a negative inference from omissions in the POE that are central to the allegations of the appellants. More recently,20 the Court noted:\nWhile minor discrepancies between POE declarations and oral testimony are not sufficient to support a finding that an applicant lacks credibility, the Board may draw a negative inference from the omission of an element that is central to the claim.21\n[34] The RPD panel set out in its reasons that the POE notes omitted the key incidents that the associate adult appellant later raised in the associate appellant's BOC and in his testimony.22 I do not find that this was a situation of omissions of minor details nor was the RPD panel microscopic or over-vigilant in its examination.\n[35] As a result of the credibility issues arising from the inability of the appellants to satisfactorily explain the omissions in their POE documents regarding their fears of a criminal cartel and their failure to disclose the attempted kidnaping of their son and the various residences where they had lived prior to coming to Canada, I find that the principal and associate adult appellants are not reliable witnesses.\n[36] When this finding is combined with a dearth of documentary evidence to support the appellants' specific allegations of running from a criminal cartel in Mexico for several years, I find the appellants have not established that they were being sought by a criminal cartel in Mexico when they left the country or that such would be the case if they returned to Mexico. Given this finding is central to their claims under section 97(1) of IRPA I find the appellants are not persons in need of protection.\nCONCLUSION\n[37] The RAD dismisses the appeal and confirms the decision of the RPD that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor a persons in need of protection, pursuant to section 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\n(signed)\n\"Richard Jackson\"\nRichard Jackson\nDecember 11, 2018\nDate\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD File \/ Dossier de la SAR : VB8-01434\nVB8-01435 \/ VB8-01436\nRAD.25.02 (September 18, 2018)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n10\nRAD.25.02 (September 18, 2018)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n",

His Notice of Appeal was received by the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) on February 11, 2014, and he received the reasons of the RPD on February 3, 2014.\n[2] Section 159.91(1) of the amended Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations provides that the time limit for a person or the Minister to file an appeal is fifteen days after the day on which the RPD's reasons are received, while the time limit to perfect an appeal is thirty days after the receipt of those reasons. As such, the Appellant's Notice of Appeal was to be filed on or before February 18, 2014, and his appeal was to be perfected on or before March 5, 2014.\n[3] The Appellant has filed an Application for an Extension of Time to File or Perfect an Appeal, which was received by the RAD on March 4, 2014. The Appellant's appeal record was received by the RAD on March 11, 2014. On the Application for an Extension of Time to File or Perfect an Appeal, the Appellant's counsel explains that she has been sick for the last few days and that a virus infected her computer causing technical problems.\n[4] The Appellant asks that, for reasons of fairness and natural justice, his application be allowed and the requested extension of time granted.\n[5] The Minister has not responded to this Application.\nDETERMINATION OF THE APPLICATION\n[6] The RAD accepts the application for an extension of time to perfect this appeal.\nApplication for Extension of Time\n[7] Section 159.91(2) of the Regulations states:\n\"If the appeal cannot be filed within the time limit set out in paragraph 1(a) or perfected within the time limit set out in paragraph (1)(b), the Refugee Appeal Division may, for reasons of fairness and natural justice, extend each of those time limits by the number of days that is necessary in the circumstances.\"\n[8] This provision contains three requirements. First, it must not be possible for an appeal to be filed and perfected within the time limits set out. Under this element, the Appellant must provide an explanation for the delay and must show a continuing intention to appeal during the delay. RAD Rule 37(4) requires the evidence to be in the form of an affidavit or statutory declaration. Second, any extension must be only for the number of days necessary in the circumstances. This requirement suggests that the delay should be as short as possible or, in other words, that every day of delay should be justified. The reference to \"circumstances\" implies an individualized assessment of the circumstances in each particular request for an extension of time. Third, any extension must be for reasons of fairness and natural justice. Jurisprudence has established four factors to be considered in applications for extension of time before courts or administrative tribunals: 1\n(a) there was and is a continuing intention on the part of the party presenting the motion to pursue the appeal;\n(b) the subject matter of the appeal discloses an arguable case;\n(c) there is a reasonable explanation for the defaulting parties delay; and\n(d) there is no prejudice to the other party in allowing the extension.\n[9] These factors are not exhaustive, and other factors may be considered, such as, for example, the complexity of an appeal, a factor mentioned in RAD Rule 6(7). All of the factors do not have to be met. The appropriate weight must be assigned to each factor in the context of a particular case. The four factors are to be applied to determine whether fairness and natural justice in the circumstances require an extension of time for a particular number of days.\n[10] In the RAD's view, the Appellant has given a reasonable explanation for the delay, the delay is minimal, and the Appellant has shown a continuing intention to pursue his appeal.\n[11] The application for extension of time is therefore allowed and the file is declared perfected as of March 11, 2014.\nNormand Leduc\nNormand Leduc\nApril 10, 2014\nDate\n\/kp\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n2\nRAD.25.02 (February 7, 2014)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\nRAD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SAR : MB4-00605\n",

He also alleges that he received a death threat from the [translation] \"security forces\" in his country on XXXX XXXX, 2017, following his trip to Ukraine, during which he applied for and obtained a Canadian visa.\n[5] On XXXX XXXX, 2017, the appellant left Georgia for Canada, where he claimed refugee protection in February 2018.\n[6] Following a hearing on February 15, 2019, the RPD rejected his claim on the ground that the appellant's allegations were not credible.\n[7] The appellant submits to the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) that the RPD erred in assessing his credibility, for reasons that will be explained in detail in the Analysis section below, if necessary.\n[8] For these reasons, the appellant requests that the RAD set aside the RPD determination and grant him refugee protection or return the matter to the RPD for re-determination.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW AND ROLE OF THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION\n[9] The role of the RAD is to review the decisions of the RPD by applying the correctness standard of review after conducting its own analysis of the record in order to determine if the RPD erred as alleged by the appellant.\nANALYSIS\n[10] The issue in this case is whether the RPD erred in its assessment of the credibility of the appellant's allegations.\n[11] After analyzing all of the evidence submitted, which included listening to the recording of the RPD hearing, and its reasons for the decision, I find that the answer to the question is no, for the following reasons.\n[12] The RPD's decision is essentially based on the fact that the appellant is incapable of explaining why he allegedly joined the UNM party in 2015, although he alleges that he was an active member of that party, and the fact that he did not provide any document that could corroborate his membership and activities within it.\n[13] When questioned about his reasons for joining this opposition party in Georgia in December 2015, after spending a few months in the United States, the appellant answered that after the GD party was elected (in 2012), the country [translation] \"regressed\" and that there was less crime when the UNM was in power.\n[14] The RPD found the appellant's explanations to be [translation] \"generic\" and not those that one would expect from an individual who claims to have been actively involved in a political party.\n[15] In his memorandum, the appellant submits that the panel cannot require corroborating documents only when doubt has been cast on his testimony's credibility.\n[16] This submission is accurate, but I find that in this case, there is indeed doubt about the credibility of the appellant's allegation that he is an active member of the UNM party in Georgia, because of his answer about why he allegedly joined that party, as mentioned above. I cannot help but note that the appellant's testimony on the matter was brief and lacking in detail and specifics for an individual who states that he is active in the party, as he does. I also note that the appellant is an educated person, with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\n[17] Furthermore, when questioned about the steps he took to obtain documents from his party in order to prove his membership and his activities within it, the appellant answered that he did not take any because he did not [translation] \"want to bother the party.\"\n[18] Also, the appellant's testimony regarding steps taken to obtain documents is contradictory. He first stated that he did not know that such documents were necessary and did not take any steps, and then went on to state that he had sent an email to the party to obtain documents. However, he did not submit any copy of this email as evidence.\n[19] In any event, I find, just as the RPD did, that the confused and contradictory testimony and the failure to take any steps to obtain documents from his party can only undermine the appellant's credibility with regard to his membership and activities within the UNM.\n[20] The UNM is an official party with offices in Georgia and it is reasonable to believe that it would have been easy for the appellant to obtain documents corroborating his central allegations, if they were true.\n[21] Also, when questioned as to whether he had a medical report for being hospitalized after the alleged assault, the appellant answered that he had one, but that he had given it to his employer. When asked if he had contacted his employer or the hospital to obtain a copy, the appellant answered no. He then added that he had asked his spouse in Georgia to contact the hospital but it refused to issue a copy of the report. The appellant's answers are contradictory and can only undermine his credibility. His failure to take steps to obtain the medical document in question also undermines his credibility.\n[22] The appellant also alleges having had to see a psychologist in Georgia because of the alleged threats and assaults he endured. When asked if he had tried to obtain a report from the psychologist, the appellant, once again, answered no, because he did not want to [translation] \"bother the psychologist.\" He specified that this psychologist is a family friend. Once again, I find that the appellant's failure to try to obtain such a medical document-which is available, in all likelihood-undermines his credibility.\n[23] Lastly, the RPD considered the fact that the appellant went to Ukraine in XXXX 2017 and later voluntarily returned to Georgia, the fact that the appellant did not claim asylum in the XXXX, where travelled on his way to Canada, and the fact that he made misrepresentations in order to obtain his Canadian visa are all elements that undermine his credibility.\n[24] When questioned about his return to Georgia after his trip to Ukraine and about his reasons for not claiming asylum there, the appellant answered that he wanted to have his affairs in order and say goodbye to his family. In my opinion, these explanations are not reasonable, considering the allegations of persecution and the fact that the appellant wrote in his BOC Form that he decided to leave his country in May 2017, after the alleged assault.\n[25] I also find that this voluntary return to his country is yet another element that undermines the appellant's credibility.\n[26] The fact that he did not claim asylum in XXXX XXXX and that he lied on his visa application are, in my opinion, secondary elements in the analysis of the evidence submitted.\n[27] Consequently, in light of the foregoing, I conclude that the appellant failed to establish that the RPD committed errors that would justify the RAD setting aside the determination.\nREMEDY\n[28] For these reasons, I confirm the RPD's determination, namely, that XXXX XXXX is neither a \"Convention refugee\" pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA nor a \"person in need of protection\" within the meaning of section 97 of the IRPA.\n[29] The appeal is dismissed.\n(signed)\nNormand Leduc\nNormand Leduc\nSeptember 2, 2020\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\nRAD File No. \/ No de dossier de la SAR : TB9-10704\nRAD.25.02 (January 2020)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n5\nImmigration and Refugee\nBoard of Canada\nRefugee Appeal Division\nCommission de l'immigration et du\nstatut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 du Canada\nSection d'appel des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s\nRAD.25.02 (January 2020)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] XXXX XXXX (the Appellant), a citizen of Kenya, appeals a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) denying his claim for refugee protection.\n[2] He has submitted new evidence in support of his appeal. He asks that the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) set aside the decision of the RPD and substitute its own decision he is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection, or, in the alternative, refer his claim back to the RPD for redetermination.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] Pursuant to section 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the RAD confirms the determination of the RPD and dismisses the appeal.\nBackground\n[4] The Appellant alleged before the RPD that he fears persecution in Kenya due to his sexual orientation as a bisexual man. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, his wife discovered him and his same-sex partner in bed together. She later disclosed this information to her family member who threatened the Appellant with death. The Appellant went into hiding until he was able to leave Kenya and travel to Canada. After arriving in Canada, he learned that his wife's family reported him to the Kenyan police.\n[5] The Appellant's application for refugee protection was heard on October 29, 2015. In a decision of November 18, 2015, the RPD rejected the Appellant's claim finding that the Appellant was not a credible witness. The Appellant submits that the RPD erred in its assessment of his personal documentary evidence and that cumulatively this evidence establishes, on a balance of probabilities, risks to his life under s.96 and s. 97 of the IRPA.\nROLE OF THE RAD\n[6] The RAD finds that the recent Federal Court of Appeal decision, in Huruglica,1 provides the RAD with guidance in relation to the appropriate standard that must be applied by a specialized tribunal such as the RAD to decisions of a first-level administrative tribunal. In accordance with the decision of the Federal Court, the RAD will conduct its own analysis of the evidence to determine if the RPD erred and come to its own determination whether the Appellant is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\nApplication to Submit Documents Not Previously Submitted\n[7] On May 16, 2016, the Appellant filed an application to tender documents not previously submitted. In the application, the Appellant argues these documents establish the validity of the warrant2 that was issued for his arrest. The Appellant has submitted two letters from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The company is self-described as advocates, Commissioners of Oath and Notaries Public. The letters, both signed by the same person, were written to the Appellant's counsel and to the Appellant himself. The letters state that the company has ascertained and verified that the warrant is valid and enforceable. In his application, the Appellant states that he engaged the services of the company to verify the legality of the warrant. He further states that, although the letters provided by the company are dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2016, they were not sent to him until he was able to pay for the services provided. As a result, he did not receive the documents until XXXX XXXX, 2016.\n[8] The RAD has considered these documents, pursuant to the factors in Rule 29(4). Section 29(4) of the RAD Rules states that:\n(4) In deciding whether to allow an application, the Division must consider any relevant factors, including\n(a) the document's relevance and probative value;\n(b) any new evidence the document brings to the appeal; and\n(c) whether the person who is the subject of the appeal, with reasonable effort, could have provided the document or written submissions with the appellant's record, respondent's record or reply record.\n[9] The RAD notes that the Appellant's Record, which included the warrant of arrest as new evidence, was received by the Board on February 29, 2016. Although the Appellant states that he engaged the company to verify the warrant sometime after he received it, he did not indicate when he did so. Furthermore, the RAD notes that, although the warrant was tendered with the Appellant's Record on February 29, 2016, the Appellant did not state at that time that he had engaged anyone to verify the warrant.\n[10] The RAD finds that the Appellant has not provided a sufficient explanation of why he could not, with reasonable effort, have provided these documents with the Appellant's Record. Although he now alludes to the fact that he was unable to afford to pay for the services provided until XXXX XXXX, 2016, the RAD notes that there is no corroboration of how and when the fees were paid or when the services were requested. The RAD finds that it is reasonable to expect that the Appellant seek verification of the warrant at the first instance, but, as stated, the Appellant has not provided a sufficient explanation of why this was not done.\n[11] Accordingly, the Appellant's application to submit these document must fail under the provisions of Rule 29(4)(c).\n[12] The RAD finds in the alternative that, even if the letters were admitted as new evidence in this appeal, the RAD could give them little weight. The RAD notes that, although the letters indicate that the company has verified the validity of the warrant of arrest, there is no explanation of how this was accomplished. The RAD finds it reasonable to expect an explanation of by what means the validity of the warrant was verified. Furthermore, the RAD finds it reasonable to expect that there would be some corroborating documentary evidence of the verification process and validity of the warrant. The RAD notes that there is no accompanying letter or documents from either the police or the courts in Kenya that offer any corroboration. Furthermore, the RAD notes that the letters are not in the form of affidavits. The RAD finds it reasonable to expect, given the nature of the company supplying the letters, that they would be sworn documents.\n[13] The RAD finds, based on the foregoing analysis, that these letter should be given little weight.\nADMISSIBILITY OF NEW EVIDENCE PRESENTED ON APPEAL\n[14] As provided for in s. 110(3) of the IRPA, with certain exceptions, the RAD must proceed without a hearing, on the basis of the record of the proceedings of the RPD and may accept documentary evidence and written submissions from the Minister and refugee claimant. Subsection 110(4) of the IRPA provides that the person who is the subject of the appeal may present only evidence that arose after the rejection of their claim or that was not reasonably available, or that the person could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection.\n[15] The Appellant has submitted the following documents as new evidence in this appeal:\n(a) a warrant of arrest dated XXXX XXXX, 2016 together with the courier envelope;\n(b) an Affidavit of the Appellant's wife dated XXXX XXXX, 2016;\n(c) identification of XXXX XXXX; and\n(d) a mailing envelope of a letter from the office of the President.\n[16] The Appellant submits that the proposed new evidence meets the test of s.110(4) of the IRPA because the evidence is new, credible, and relevant and\/or was not reasonably available to him.\n[17] The RAD's analysis of the admissibility of the proposed new evidence must begin first with the test set out in s. 110(4). The RAD finds that further analysis of the evidence is required before the RAD can accept the proposed new evidence. In that regard, the RAD is guided by the analysis as set out in Raza.3 Although Raza is not entirely appropriate for the purpose of assessing evidence submitted to the RAD, the RAD is guided by the Federal Court of Appeal decision in Singh.4 Accordingly, the RAD has adapted the analysis in Raza to the assessment of evidence submitted to the RAD.\n[18] In assessing whether the proposed new evidence meets the statutory provisions of s. 110(4), the RAD considered the following:\n(a) First, did the evidence arise after the rejection of the Appellant's refugee claim? Here, the RAD may consider whether the evidence is capable of proving the current state of affairs in the country of feared persecution, or an event that occurred or a circumstance that arose after the rejection of the refugee claim.5\n(b) The RAD will consider not only the date on which the document came into existence, but the timing of the event or circumstance which the document seeks to prove.6 For example, an affidavit or newspaper article may have been created after the rejection of the Appellant's refugee claim, but the information in the document may be several years old, and the RAD may therefore find that the evidence did not arise after the rejection of the claim, despite the date of the document.\n(c) It is important to note here that s. 110(4) does not contemplate whether the evidence arose after the RPD hearing, but rather after the rejection of the Appellant's claim. Where a document arose after the hearing but before the rejection of the refugee claim, it is necessary for the RAD to consider whether the Appellant could have presented the document to the RPD by way of a post-hearing submission.\n(d) If the evidence is capable of proving an event that occurred or circumstances that arose after the RPD hearing, then the evidence must be considered, and the RAD will proceed to assess the credibility, relevance, and materiality of the document.7\n(e) Second, if the RAD finds that the evidence did not arise after the rejection of the Appellant's refugee claim, it must consider the next factor in s. 110(4). If the evidence is capable of proving only an event that occurred or circumstances that arose prior to the rejection, has the Appellant established that the evidence was not reasonably available for presentation to the RPD before it rejected the claim,8 or that it proves a fact that was unknown to him at the time of the hearing?9 If so, the RAD will proceed to assess the newness, credibility and relevance of the evidence.\n(f) Third, if the RAD finds that the evidence did not arise after the rejection of the Appellant's refugee claim, and that it was reasonably available at the time of the rejection, it must consider the final part of the s. 110(4) test: could the Appellant reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented the evidence prior to the rejection of his refugee claim? If so, the evidence need not be considered.10 If the Appellant could not reasonably have been expected to present the evidence to the RPD, the RAD will proceed to assess the newness, credibility, and relevance of the evidence.\n(g) If the proposed new evidence meets the tests set out in the statutory requirements and in Raza, the evidence will be admitted as evidence in the appeal. The materiality of the evidence will be considered in the context of the assessment made under section 110(6) of the IRPA.\n[19] In the case at hand, the Appellant argues in particular that the arrest warrant and affidavit of his wife provides evidence of a new allegation of state persecution that post-dates the hearing into his refugee claim and establishes the nature of his ongoing risk in Kenya. The Appellant submits that the warrant of arrest was not served on his wife in Kenya until XXXX XXXX XXXX 2016, and, as such, he argues that it was not reasonable to expect him to have those available for his RPD hearing or the rejection of his claim. Similarly, the Appellant argues that the affidavit of his wife, which details the service of the arrest warrant, was not reasonably available prior to the rejection of his claim.\n[20] The RAD finds that the new evidence meets the statutory requirements of section 110(4) of the IRPA. The RAD admits these documents as new evidence in this appeal and will address the probative value of this evidence in the Merits of the Claim analysis to follow.\n[21] The Appellant has also tendered the identification of XXXX XXXX11 because the RPD gave the document little weight because of the lack of identification accompanying the affidavit. He argues that he did not know that identification was required and that he was not advised by his counsel that identification would be required. In addition, the Appellant has tendered the mailing envelope of a letter from the office of the President, which he submits was requested by the RPD at the RPD hearing.\n[22] The RAD finds that these documents do not meet the statutory requirements as new evidence in this appeal. The RAD finds there is a requirement on the Appellant to provide an explanation about why the proposed new evidence meets the statutory requirement. The Court has held that if an applicant believes that the evidence meets the requirements of paragraph 113(a), it is up to the applicant to provide explanations as to why it conforms to the statutory requirement.12 For example, if the evidence pre-dates the RPD's decision, it is the duty of the person submitting the new evidence to provide why it had not been placed in front of the RPD under the express statutory requirements under paragraph 113(a).13\n[23] Under a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA), the Federal Court has held that it is the applicant's obligation to provide an explanation as to why the evidence could not have been presented to the RPD. Evidence can be rejected for this reason and this is in conformity with the requirements set out in the IRPA and found in Raza.14\n[24] Similarly, the Refugee Appeal Division Rules15 (RAD Rules) provide that the Appellant's record must contain: (i) a written statement indicating whether the Appellant is relying on any evidence referred to in subsection 110(4) of the IRPA, and (ii) a memorandum that includes full and detailed submissions regarding how any documentary evidence that the Appellant wants to rely on in the appeal meets the requirements of subsection 110(4) of the IRPA and how that evidence relates to the Appellant.\n[25] The RAD has considered the recent Federal Court decision, in Singh,16 and finds that there is nothing in the decision which takes away the burden of the Appellant to provide an explanation of how the proposed new evidence meets the test set out in s. 110(4) of the IRPA.\n[26] The RAD finds that the Appellant has provided an insufficient explanation why it was not reasonable for him to tender that evidence prior to the rejection of his claim. His only explanation with regard to why the envelope was not submitted was that it was found by his wife in XXXX 2016. The Appellant has not provided any explanation of what efforts were made to obtain the envelope so that it could be tendered prior to the rejection of his claim. The RAD also notes that, although the Appellant has tendered an affidavit from his wife, the affidavit is silent on the issue of the envelope.\n[27] With regard to the identification, the RAD notes that the Appellant seems to blame the fact that it was not tendered with this affidavit on his previous counsel. However, the Appellant has not provided an explanation why it could not have been tendered prior to the rejection of his claim. The Appellant seems to argue that he only became aware of the need for the identification after the rejection of the claim; however, the RAD notes that the RPD expressed concerns about the affidavit during the hearing. Although the Appellant argues that the RPD gave the affidavit little weight on the basis of the missing identification, the RAD notes that the RPD also had other concerns which undermined the genuineness of the affidavits tendered before the RPD including similarities of the signatures, handwriting, and wording of the affidavits. The RAD notes that the Appellant was represented by competent counsel at his RPD hearing; however, there is no indication in the record that the Appellant made any effort to tender that evidence as post-hearing evidence in his RPD claim.\n[28] In order for the RAD to determine if the Appellant could not have reasonably been expected to present the evidence to the RPD, the RAD finds it is incumbent on the Appellant to present a sufficient persuasive argument. His declaration requires a further explanation of the circumstances that prevented the Appellant from tendering documents which were apparently available.\nANALYSIS OF THE MERITS OF THE APPEAL\nCredibility Findings\n[29] The RPD found that there were serious credibility concerns with the Appellant's testimony and the genuineness of his supporting documents which undermined the credibility of his allegations.\n[30] The RAD notes that, although the RPD made numerous credibility findings which undermine the Appellant's central allegations including his alleged sexual orientation, the Appellant has not contested those credibility findings. The Appellant instead submits that the RPD's treatment of his supporting documentary evidence was flawed and that the cumulative documentary evidence now before the RPD establishes, on a balance of probabilities, that he is at risk in Kenya.\n[31] After its own review and assessment of the evidence including the recording of the hearing, the RAD finds that the RPD's findings with respect to the Appellant's testimony are more than sufficient to undermine the Appellant's general credibility and the credibility of his allegations that he is bisexual and is wanted by the police in Kenya. Having reviewed the evidence in relation to those findings, the RAD agrees with the RPD's conclusions and further finds on the basis of those credibility findings and, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant is not genuinely bisexual and is not being pursued by the Kenyan Police as alleged.\nSupporting Documents\nAffidavits\n[32] The Appellant submits that the RPD misevaluated the corroborative documentary evidence he submitted in support of his claim. In particular, the Appellant submits that the RPD erred when it gave little weight to the affidavits from his two friends and his wife. He argues that the RPD did not explicitly rule on the authenticity of the sworn affidavits. He argues that, if the RPD did not believe the documents were genuine, the RPD should have discarded the documents altogether. He argues that a document presented as genuine cannot be given little probative value on account of authenticity. The Appellant cites Elhassan v. Canada (MCI) 2016 FC 175 in support of his argument. The RAD notes however that the citation is incorrect.17\n[33] The RAD is not persuaded by the Appellant's argument in this case. The RAD finds that the RPD did evaluate the evidence tendered. In particular, the RAD notes that the RPD identified concerns on the face of the affidavits. The RPD noted that the affidavits bear similarities including similarities with the signatures, handwriting, and wording on two of the affidavits. The Appellant was not able to provide an explanation for those similarities. The RAD notes, after its own review, that these similarities bear the hallmarks of documents which were drafted and signed by the same individual which undermines the genuineness of the documents. Furthermore, as noted by the RPD, there was no supporting identification attached. The RAD agrees with the RPD that, in light of the issues with the affidavits and the cumulative uncontested credibility concerns particularly those which undermine the genuineness of the Appellant's alleged sexual orientation, little weight can be given to the affidavits in establishing the Appellant's allegations of persecution.18 The RAD finds that the credibility concerns relied upon by the RPD are relative to the Appellant's sexual orientation and as such they have a direct relationship to the affidavits which attest to that fact.\n[34] The RAD finds that the RPD did make an explicit ruling on the documents and finds there was no need for the RPD to find explicitly that the documents were fraudulent. Regardless, the RAD finds that, after its own assessment of the affidavits, the above-noted findings are sufficient to undermine the genuineness of the affidavits, and the RAD gives them no weight.\n[35] The Appellant further submits that the RPD erred when it failed to state in its reasons why it found that the affidavits were \"untested\". The RAD finds that the RPD's use of the word \"untested\" refers to the fact that the identity of the affiants was unclear and the fact that the affiants did not testify. Regardless, the RAD finds there are sufficient reasons provided which undermine the genuineness of the affidavits.\nLetters from the Kenyan Police\n[36] The Appellant also tendered two letters purportedly mailed by the Kenyan police to the Appellant.19 The RPD found that, in light of the irregularities on the face of the letters and in the context of the Appellant's vague testimony, as well as the credibility concerns already identified, it could give little weight to these documents.\n[37] The Appellant again argues that the RPD failed to make an explicit finding on the genuineness of the letters. The RAD is not persuaded by the Appellant's argument in this regard.\n[38] The RAD again notes that the RPD did evaluate the evidence tendered and noted several concerns with the letters. The RPD noted that the Appellant did not submit the envelopes for these letters; both letters were similarly addressed to \"TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN\" rather than specifically addressed to the Appellant despite his assertion the letters were mailed directly to him. The RPD also noted spelling and grammatical errors, including \"TO WHOM IT MAY CONERN\" in the letter from the \"Office of the President\".\n[39] The RAD finds, after its own review, that these letters bear the hallmarks of documents which undermine the genuineness of the documents. The RAD agrees with the RPD that, in light of the issues with the affidavits and the cumulative uncontested credibility concerns, particularly those which undermine the genuineness of the Appellant's alleged sexual orientation, little weight can be given to the affidavits in establishing the Appellant's allegations of persecution. The RAD finds that the credibility concerns relied upon by the RPD are relative to the Appellant's sexual orientation, and, as such, they have a direct relationship to these letters.\n[40] While the RPD did make an explicit ruling on the documents and that there was no need for the RPD to find explicitly that the documents were fraudulent, the RAD finds, after its own assessment the basis of the forgoing, that the letters are not genuine documents. The RAD further finds that in tendering non-genuine documents in support of his claim, the Appellant has significantly undermined his general credibility and the credibility of his allegations.\nLetter from XXXX\n[41] The Appellant tendered a letter from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The RPD found that it could give the letter little weight in establishing his alleged sexual orientation.\n[42] The Appellant submits that he RPD misevaluated the letter and argues that the RPD erred by finding his involvement with the XXXX was limited. He argues that his limited involvement with the XXXX is because he has only been in Canada a limited time.\n[43] The RAD is not persuaded by the Appellant's argument in this regard. As noted by the RPD, the Appellant testified he does not attend any other support groups because he lives in XXXX. The RAD takes judicial notice that XXXX is a large urban centre which offers a wide variety of services to the LGBT community. The RAD notes that, regardless of when the Appellant joined the XXXX, the letter offers very limited information and does not attest to the Appellant's alleged sexual orientation. The RAD agrees with the RPD and finds little weight can be given to the letter from the XXXX in establishing the Appellant's sexual orientation.\nNew Evidence Warrant of Arrest and Accompanying Affidavit\n[44] The Appellant submits that the warrant of arrest and sworn affidavit introduces a new allegation of state persecution that is relaxant and material to the appeal. He argues that this new evidence raises the risk he faces if he were to return to Kenya.\n[45] While the RAD has found that this evidence meets the statutory requirements of section 110(4) of the IRPA and has admitted this evidence in this appeal, the RAD nonetheless must consider its probative value. In light of numerous uncontested credibility findings which undermine the Appellant's alleged sexual orientation, the finding that the Appellant has tendered non-genuine police letters in support of his claim, the finding that his general credibility has been undermined, and that he has not tendered trustworthy or reliable documents to support his allegations, the RAD finds that the Appellant's allegations that he is being pursued by the police in Kenya because of his sexual orientation is not credible. The RAD finds that the warrant for arrest and accompanying affidavit from the Appellant's wife do not overcome the overwhelming cumulative adverse credibility findings noted in these reasons.\nOral Hearing\n[46] Section 110(3) of the IRPA requires that the RAD proceed without a hearing, on the basis of the RPD's record, while allowing the RAD to accept documentary evidence and submissions from the Minister and the Appellant. According to subsection 110(6), the RAD may hold a hearing if, in its opinion, there is documentary evidence referred to in 110(3) that raises a serious issue with respect to the credibility of the Appellant, that is central to the decision, and that, if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the refugee protection claim. When read together, subsections 110(3), (4), and (6) establish that the RAD must not hold a hearing in an appeal such as this unless there is new evidence (i.e., evidence admitted under section 110(4), section 110(5) or Minister's evidence), in which case the RAD may hold a hearing if that new evidence raises a serious issue with respect to the credibility of the Appellant, is central to the RPD's decision, and that, if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the refugee protection claim.\n[47] The Appellant argues that the new evidence raises a very serious allegation of state persecution which will be central to the decision and which can be dispositive of the appeal. While the RAD admitted new evidence in this appeal, the RAD finds that it cannot hold a hearing. As previously stated in these reasons, new evidence cannot outweigh the totality of the adverse credibility findings. Accordingly, the RAD finds that the evidence would not justify allowing or rejecting the refugee protection claim. The RAD has found that the RPD's decision stands on its own merits even in the face of the new evidence. As such, as the proposed evidence does not justify either allowing or rejecting the refugee protection claim, then it does not meet the requirements of 110(6). Each of the requirements in 110(6)(a) through (c) have to be met, and in this case the requirement in 110(6)(c) is not met. Accordingly, the RAD has no discretion to hold a hearing.\nIn Summary\n[48] When considering in totality the cumulative adverse credibility findings noted above, the RAD finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant's evidence with regard to central allegations in Kenya are not credible.\n[49] The RAD notes that the Federal Court held in Sheikh20 that:\n... even without disbelieving every word [a claimant] has uttered, a ... panel may reasonably find him so lacking in credibility that it concludes there is no credible evidence relevant to his claim... In other words, a general finding of a lack of credibility on the part of the [claimant] may conceivably extend to all relevant evidence emanating from his testimony.\n[50] The RAD agrees with the RPD and finds that, in light of the cumulative adverse credibility findings, the Appellant is not credible and that overall his allegations lack veracity. The RAD finds that there is not a serious possibility of persecution for the Appellant, nor would he be subjected personally, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to life, a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture, should he return to Kenya. Accordingly, the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nCONCLUSION\n[51] Pursuant to Section 111(1)(a) of the IRPA, the RAD confirms the decision of the RPD and dismisses the appeal.\n(signed)\n\"L.

Morse\nHearings Officer\nConseil du (de la) ministre\nReasons and Decision\n[1] Procedural fairness is a cornerstone of Canadian administrative law. Public decision-makers are required to act fairly in coming to decisions that affect the rights, privileges, or interests of an individual.1 Where a public authority has made representations about the procedure, it will follow in making a particular decision; the scope of duty of procedural fairness will be broader than it otherwise would have been.2\n[2] The Minister of Public Safety (the Appellant) appeals a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) to grant refugee status to XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX (the Respondent). The Respondent is a young man from Somalia who alleges that he was kidnapped by the al-Shabaab extremist group, which intended to recruit him. He was able to escape and make his way to Canada, where he sought and was granted refugee protection. The Minister alleges that the RPD contravened its own policy when it heard and decided the Respondent's refugee claim without awaiting the results of the Respondent's Front-End Security Screening (FESS).\n[3] Regulation 159.9 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) sets a time limit of fifteen days after receipt of the RPD's written reasons for a person or the Minister to file an appeal to the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD), and a time limit of thirty days for a person or the Minister to perfect such an appeal.\n[4] The RPD's decision in the Respondent's refugee claim is dated March 6, 2013, and the Appellant received that decision on March 8, 2013. Pursuant to the regulations, the Minister had until March 25 to file an appeal and until April 8 to perfect that appeal.\n[5] The Minister did not file or perfect the appeal within the time limits set out in the regulations. On June 24, 2013, the Minister filed the appeal record, along with an application, pursuant to Rules 12 and 37 of the Refugee Appeal Division Rules, for an extension of time to file the Notice of Appeal and the appeal record.\n[6] Pursuant to Rule 38(4) of those Rules, the Respondent had seven days to provide a written response to the application. However, by a decision of June 25, 2013, a differently-constituted panel of the RAD allowed the application before the Respondent had responded. The RAD's decision allowing the Minister's application was sent to the Minister and to the Respondent, but not to the Respondent's counsel.\n[7] On July 8, 2013, the Respondent filed his response record, which included submissions on the Minister's application for an extension of time. On July 22, 2013, the RAD received a reply from the Minister.\n[8] On August 21, 2013, the RAD wrote to the Minister and the Respondent, pursuant to Rule 53. The Division stated that it would consider, on its own initiative, whether to set aside the June 25, 2013 decision to grant the Minister's application for an extension of time on the grounds that there was a failure to observe a principle of natural justice, a failure to comply with the RAD Rules, or on other grounds raised by the parties. The RAD also stated that, if that decision was set aside, it would also consider whether to accept the Minister's application for an extension of time. Finally, the RAD also laid out a series of possible procedural steps or remedies that it would consider in light of the fact that the FESS was not completed.\n[9] The RAD invited submissions from the parties on these matters and set out a schedule by which those submissions should be provided. The Minister provided such submissions, and the Respondent responded to them. The Minister did not provide submissions in reply.\nThe RAD's Decision to Allow the Minister's Application for an Extension of Time\n[10] The Minister does not oppose the RAD's decision to reconsider the Minister's application for an extension of time. The Respondent argues that there was a clear breach of the principle of natural justice and fairness when the RAD reached its decision of June 25, 2013 without following its own Rules and without considering the Respondent's submissions.\n[11] The RAD agrees. The decision to allow the Minister's application without awaiting the Respondent's response to that application was procedurally unfair to the Respondent, and resulted in the Division making a decision without having considered the Respondent's position on the application.\n[12] Pursuant to Rule 53, the RAD sets aside its decision of June 25, 2013 on the Minister's application for an extension of time, as there was a failure to observe principles of natural justice and fairness as well as a failure to comply with the RAD Rules in reaching the decision.\nThe Minister's Application for an Extension of Time\n[13] The IRB's Instructions Governing the Management of Refugee Protection Claims Awaiting Front-end Security Screening (FESS Instructions)3 provide that where a refugee hearing is scheduled but the FESS results have not been received, the hearing will be removed from the schedule; if the screening results have not been received six months after the claim was referred, the hearing will be rescheduled and the claim heard, unless the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) makes an application to change the date and time and such application is granted. When confirmation of security screening remains pending twelve months from the date of referral, the RPD will convene a conference with the claimant, counsel, and Minister's counsel and may fix a date for a hearing.\n[14] The Appellant submits that the delay in filing the appeal record was a result of the Minister's legitimate expectation that a refugee claim will not proceed without completion of security screening. In the Appellant's view, it is not reasonable to expect the Minister to double-check the RPD's decisions to ensure that the RPD followed its own guidelines. The Appellant argues that an extension is in the interest of fairness and natural justice, and is not prejudicial to the Respondent. In the Appellant's submission, the circumstances of this case are exceptional, as they may involve the security of Canada, which is a priority under IRPA.\n[15] The Respondent submits that there is no evidence or reasonable ground to suggest that he has ever behaved in a manner that would result in an inadmissibility finding. The Respondent points out that the Minister did not file an appeal to the RAD until nearly four months after receipt of the RPD's decision. This is an undue delay, in the view of the Respondent, who argues that he has a legitimate expectation that, once he has received refugee protection and the time for appeal has passed, his status will not be \"violated.\" The Respondent submits that the Minister does not have an arguable case, as there is no evidence that he voluntarily associated with al-Shabaab or poses any security risk to Canada. Any suggestion that he may be inadmissible is, he argues, pure speculation.\n[16] Section 159.91(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations provides that, if an appeal cannot be filed or perfected within the time limits set out in the Regulations, \"the Refugee Appeal Division may, for reasons of fairness and natural justice, extend each of those time limits by the number of days that is necessary in the circumstances.\"\n[17] This provision contains three elements: it must not be possible for the appeal to be filed and perfected within the time limits; an extension must be for the number of days necessary in the circumstances; and any extension must be for reasons of fairness and natural justice. The RAD has considered the Minister's application in light of these requirements.\n[18] Was it possible for the appeal to be filed and perfected within the time limits set out in the Regulations? The Appellant argues that this was not possible, as the Minister has a legitimate expectation that the RPD will follow its own procedures and therefore does not check in each case whether the security screening process was followed. The Respondent argues, however, that the delay in filing the appeal was unreasonable and cannot be justified.\n[19] The FESS Instructions refer to a Government of Canada commitment that all persons claiming refugee protection in Canada will receive front-end security screening.4 They provide that, where confirmation of security screening has not been received at six months from the date of referral, the RPD will normally proceed to schedule and hear the claim unless the CBSA files an application to change the date and time and that application is allowed.5\n[20] The FESS Instructions also provide that, when confirmation of security screening remains pending twelve months from the date of referral, the RPD will convene a conference with the claimant, counsel, and Minister's counsel and may fix a date for a hearing.\n[21] The Respondent's refugee claim was filed on December 25, 2012 and was referred to the RPD on December 27, 2012.6 Despite the fact that security screening was not completed, the claim was heard on February 21, 2013, and determined by a decision dated March 6, 2013.\n[22] RPD members and other personnel are required to follow the instructions.7 Where a hearing is scheduled and confirmation of security screening has not been received, the RPD must remove the hearing from the schedule. While the FESS Instructions direct that the RPD will not hear a claim for a period of up to six months from referral unless the RPD receives confirmation from the CBSA that front-end security screening for the claimant has been completed, the RPD proceeded to hear and determine the claim about two months after referral.\n[23] The Respondent was granted refugee protection on March 6, 2013, and the Minister received written reasons for the decision on March 8, 2013. However, the Minister did not discover the RPD's error until April 11, 2013.8\n[24] To comply with the time limits in the Regulations, the Minister would have had to file by or on March 25 and perfect by or on April 8-and yet the Minister did not become aware of the error until April 11. The RAD accepts the Appellant's argument that the Minister should not be required to scrupulously check each RPD decision for compliance with the FESS Instructions. In these circumstances, the RAD finds that it was not possible for the Minister to file and perfect this appeal within the time limits set out in the Regulations.\n[25] Is the requested extension for the number of days necessary in the circumstances? It appears that the Minister waited to file this appeal for two and a half months-about 74 days-after discovering the error.\n[26] The Minister submits that the delay in filing the appeal record was caused by the fact that the Minister had a legitimate expectation that a refugee claim will not proceed without completion of security screening, and that it is not reasonable to expect the Minister to double-check the RPD's decisions to ensure that the RPD followed its own guidelines.9 This is a reasonable explanation for the delay up until the point when the Minister learned that the Respondent's claim had been approved without the completion of security clearance. However, the Minister has provided no justification for the delay between April 11, when the Minister learned of the error, and June 24, when the appeal was filed.\n[27] Section 159.91(2) of the Regulations permits the RAD to extend the time limits to file and perfect an appeal-but it may only extend such limits by the number of days that is necessary in the circumstances. The Minister has provided no justification for a delay of more than two months, which makes it difficult for the RAD to determine whether an extension of time is necessary in the circumstances.\n[28] The RAD has, however, considered the objectives of IRPA with respect to refugees, including to \"protect the health and safety of Canadians and to maintain the security of Canadian society.\"10 The objectives of IRPA have been held by the Supreme Court as expressing an intent to prioritize security.11 The FESS Instructions note the federal government's commitment to security screening to ensure that individuals who might pose a risk to Canada are not granted refugee protection. In the RAD's view, the RPD's contravention of the Instructions is a very serious security-related matter, and, as such, the subject matter of the Minister's appeal is directly related to the IRPA's objective of maintaining the security of Canadian society. If the RAD does not grant the extension, the appeal is untimely and will not be considered by the RAD. In these very special circumstances, the RAD finds it is necessary to extend the time limits as requested by the Appellant.\n[29] Is the extension for reasons of justice and fairness? The RAD has considered jurisprudence which sets out four factors to be assessed in considering applications for extension of time at courts or administrative tribunals. When applied to this matter, the factors require the RAD to consider:\na. whether there was and is a continuing intent on the part of the Minister to pursue the appeal;\nb. whether the subject matter of the appeal discloses an arguable case;\nc. whether there is a reasonable explanation for the delay; and\nd. whether there is prejudice to the other party in allowing the extension.\n[30] Other factors may be considered, and not every factor need be met; however, the underlying consideration is to ensure that justice is done between the parties.12 To express this in the context of Section 159.91(2), the RAD applies these factors to ensure that the requirements of \"fairness and natural justice\" are met.\n[31] The Minister's appeal, application, and submissions indicate that there is a continuing intent to pursue the appeal.\n[32] The Respondent argues that the Minister's appeal does not disclose an arguable case. In the Respondent's submission, it is pure speculation to suggest that he might pose any risk to Canada, as there is no evidence to that effect. In fact, his evidence-found by the RPD to be credible-establishes that he was kidnapped by al-Shabaab and forced to train with them. He fears and disagrees with the group.\n[33] In the RAD's view, however, the Minister's appeal is not based on the assertion that the Respondent is inadmissible or is a security risk to Canada. Rather, the Appellant argues that, without the benefit of the security screening results, the Minister simply cannot know whether the Respondent is a security risk. The appeal is based on the contention that the Minister was denied the opportunity to obtain and consider security screening results and to participate, if so desired, in the Respondent's refugee hearing.\n[34] The appeal does make out an arguable case. The RPD ignored its own FESS Instructions and heard and determined a refugee claim without having obtained security screening results. This is arguably a denial of procedural fairness to the Minister.\n[35] The RAD has already found that there is a reasonable explanation for some, but not most, of the delay in bringing the appeal.\n[36] Will the Respondent suffer prejudice if the extension is allowed? The Minister submits that there is no prejudice, as the security screening remains incomplete, and the Respondent is thus still in the same situation as he would have been had his refugee hearing not taken place. In any event, the Minister points out that the Respondent is unable to obtain permanent resident status until his security screening is complete.\n[37] The Respondent argues that he will be prejudiced if the RAD grants the Minister's application for an extension of time. He had a legitimate expectation that, once the time periods set out in the Regulations for appeals had elapsed, he could assume that his refugee status was safe and permanent. Granting this application and allowing the Minister's request will require the Respondent to assume the financial and emotional burden of a second hearing before the RPD and the accompanying uncertainty about his status in Canada.\n[38] In the RAD's view, any assessment of prejudice must focus on the application for an extension of time, not on the appeal itself. It is obvious that, if the appeal is allowed, it will create difficulties for the Respondent. However, this would be the case regardless of whether the appeal was filed within the regulatory time limits or whether it is considered after an extension of those time limits. The RAD must consider whether the Respondent would suffer prejudice from the granting of an application for extension of time-that is, the impact of the extension itself. In some circumstances, an extension of time might be prejudicial because memories have faded, documents have been lost, or witnesses have become unavailable.13\n[39] The Respondent does not argue that the delay will prejudice his ability to respond to or defend against the Minister's appeal, and, in this respect, the RAD finds that the delay is not prejudicial to the Respondent.\n[40] The Appellant's application shows a continuing intent to pursue the appeal, which makes out an arguable case, and allowing the application does not prejudice the Respondent's ability to contest the appeal. The RAD has already discussed the lack of explanation for the Appellant's delay; while this factor does not support the granting of the application in the interest of fairness and natural justice, the RAD finds that it is outweighed by the other three factors discussed above, which together illustrate that the granting of an extension is indeed in the interest of fairness and natural justice.\n[41] It was not possible for the Appellant to file and perfect this appeal within the time limits set out in the Regulations. Having carefully considered the requirements set out in Section 159.91(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, the RAD allows the Appellant's application for an extension of time for reasons of fairness and natural justice. The Appellant's Notice of Appeal and appeal record, filed June 24, 2013, are accepted as timely.\nThe Appeal\n[42] At the heart of the Minister's appeal is the argument that, by proceeding without a front-end security clearance, the RPD committed an error of law. The Minister had a legitimate expectation that the RPD would not proceed before the clearance was completed, and, as such, the RPD committed a breach of procedural fairness.\n[43] The Minister asks the RAD to place him in the position he was in prior to the determination of the Respondent's refugee claim, so that if, upon completion of the security screening, there is evidence of a security concern, the Minister may consider whether the Respondent is inadmissible to Canada or is excludable under Article 1F of the refugee Convention. The Minister also asks the RAD to direct the RPD to wait before proceeding with a new hearing until either one year has elapsed from the date of the reception of the claim, or until the front-end security clearance has been completed, as mandated by the RPD's own FESS Instructions.14\n[44] The Respondent submits that there is no evidence or any reasonable grounds to suggest that he has ever engaged in conduct that would support an inadmissibility or exclusion finding. If security screening gives rise to such a concern, the Minister has the ability to file an application to vacate his refugee decision under Section 109(1) of IRPA or to prepare a Section 44 report and pursue inadmissibility findings. It is premature to strip the Respondent of his status when there is no evidence or justifiable reason to believe that he is inadmissible to Canada. He argues that he provided testimony, which the RPD found to be credible, against which the Minister's concerns are only speculation. To grant the Minister's appeal based on such speculation, submits the Respondent, would itself be a breach of natural justice and the duty of fairness, because the effect would be to take away his refugee status and force him to undergo a new RPD hearing-even if the completed security screening raises no concerns. The Respondent asks the RAD to confirm the decision of the RPD and dismiss the Minister's appeal.\n[45] In reply, the Minister notes that the Respondent did not challenge the Minister's claim that the RPD breached the principles of natural justice by holding a hearing without completion of front-end security screening. The Minister submits that a vacation application under Section 109(1) is not a sufficient remedy for the breach: such an application shifts the burden of proof from the Respondent to the Minister, and it requires the Minister to prove material misrepresentation. In the Minister's view, where a breach of natural justice has been established, the remedy is for the case to be remitted back to the tribunal for redetermination.\n[46] In its August 21, 2013 communication to the parties, a differently-constituted panel of the RAD invited submissions on three possible courses of action: proceeding to a final determination of the Respondent's refugee claim at the RAD under either Section 111(1)(a) or Section 111(1)(b) of IRPA; the RAD remaining seized of the appeal until twelve months have elapsed from the referral of the claim to the RPD, at which time a conference will be convened with the parties to decide further steps; or the RAD remaining seized of the appeal until such time as the security screening is completed, at which time the RAD could proceed to a final determination of the claim under either Section 111(1)(a) or 111(1)(b) of IRPA.\n[47] The Minister submits that the RAD should neither proceed to determine the claim nor should it remain seized of the matter. The FESS Instructions require the RPD, not the RAD, to deal with the matter. If the RAD remains seized, the Minister loses his right to suspend the claim under Section 103 of IRPA if evidence of inadmissibility comes to light. Where the Minister has reasonable grounds to believe that a claimant is a member of a terrorist organization, the Minister has the option of referring the matter to the Immigration Division for an admissibility determination, during which the refugee claim is suspended. A finding of inadmissibility on security grounds renders a claim ineligible under Section 104(1)(b) of IRPA, but the claim would not be ineligible if it were before RAD.\n[48] The Minister also points out that, even if he were to obtain evidence that the Respondent is a risk to Canada, such evidence might not be sufficient to make a case for exclusion under Article 1F of the refugee Convention, even if there is sufficient ground for a finding of inadmissibility under Section 34 of IRPA. The Minister maintains his position that the matter should be referred back to the RPD for redetermination.\n[49] The Respondent also provided submissions in response to the RAD's communication. He maintains his position that the RAD should confirm the decision of the RPD that he is a Convention refugee. Nine months have now elapsed from the referral of his claim to the RPD; as there are still no security screening results, his claim could now be heard without those results, according to the Instructions. Even if the RPD had waited until today, in compliance with the FESS Instructions, the outcome would be no different. Should security concerns arise in the future, the case could be sent to an admissibility hearing following a Section 44 report by an officer, and the Minister could then present evidence, witnesses, and question the Respondent, and thus would suffer no prejudice.\nAnalysis\n[50] Before considering the remedies sought by the parties and communicated by the Division, it is necessary for the RAD to consider whether the RPD's decision was in error. If there is no error, there is no need to consider a remedy.\n[51] The Minister argues that the RPD breached the principles of natural justice by holding a hearing without completion of security screening, thereby committing an error of law.\n[52] Although IRPA sets out grounds for appeal as well as possible remedies, it does not specify the standard of review to be applied by the RAD. It is settled law that, on issues of natural justice, no deference is owed to the decision of the lower tribunal. Either such issues are beyond the scope of the standard of review, or the standard of review is one of correctness.15 In the RAD's view, this approach, which is taken by appellate and judicial review courts, should also be followed by the RAD. This appeal is therefore to be reviewed on a standard of correctness.\n[53] When applying such a standard, the RAD will not show deference to the reasoning of the RPD, but it will rather undertake its own analysis of the question. That analysis will bring the RAD to decide whether it agrees with the determination of the RPD; if not, it will substitute its own view and provide the correct answer.16\n[54] Did the RPD breach procedural fairness in hearing the Respondent's refugee claim before security screening was completed? It is clear that the RPD did not comply with its own FESS Instructions, under which the claim should not have been heard when it was, due to the incomplete front-end security screening. The Minister relies on the doctrine of legitimate expectations: the existence of administrative rules of procedure may give rise to a legitimate expectation that such procedures will be followed.\n[55] As the Minister points out, the Supreme Court has summarized the doctrine of legitimate expectations, holding that the doctrine is a facet of procedural fairness, which is the prize jewel of modern Canadian administrative law. In Agraira, the Court summarized specific conditions which must be satisfied in order for the doctrine to apply. A legitimate expectation may arise from an official practice or assurance that certain procedures will be followed as part of the decision-making process. The existence of administrative rules of procedure, or a procedure on which the agency has voluntarily embarked, may give rise to a legitimate expectation that such procedures will be followed. The practice or conduct said to give rise to the expectation must be clear, unambiguous, and unqualified.17\n[56] The circumstances giving rise to this appeal meet the conditions set out above. The Chairperson's instructions \"provide formal direction that obliges specific IRB personnel to take or to avoid certain actions.\"18 These Instructions direct that \"members and other IRB personnel shall follow these instructions in the processing of refugee protection claims before the Refugee Protection Division (RPD).\"19 This wording constitutes an official assurance that certain procedures will be followed as part of the decision-making process. To put it simply, the RPD published the instructions on front-end security clearance and committed to follow them. The instructions are clear, unambiguous, and unqualified: where security screening results have not been received and a refugee hearing is scheduled, it is to be removed from the schedule. Where the security screening has not been received at six months from the date of referral, the matter is to be scheduled for hearing, unless CBSA makes an application to change the date and time and such application is granted.\n[57] The RPD's actions in creating, publishing, and committing to follow its FESS Instructions give rise to a legitimate expectation that those instructions will be followed. There is no dispute between the parties that, in this instance, the instructions were not followed. The Respondent's refugee claim was heard less than two months after referral, while security screening was incomplete, in clear contravention of the Instructions. The RPD's actions deprived the Minister of the opportunity to complete its investigation into the Respondent, and to potentially participate in the Respondent's refugee claim on the basis of any evidence arising from that investigation.\n[58] The RAD finds that the Minister had a legitimate expectation that the RPD would follow its security screening instructions. The RPD's failure to do so amounts to a breach of procedural fairness and a denial of natural justice, which is an error of law. As such, the RPD's decision cannot stand.\n[59] The RAD acknowledges the Respondent's submissions on the matter of inadmissibility. The Minister has not disclosed evidence that the Respondent has engaged in conduct that might render him inadmissible or excludable. The RAD has found that the RPD's actions led to a breach of procedural fairness. The RAD has not found that the Respondent is inadmissible or even that any evidence exists suggesting inadmissibility or excludability. As a result of the RPD's failure to follow the FESS Instructions, there is simply no security screening evidence before the RAD.\nRemedy\n[60] The Minister maintains that the only remedy for a denial of natural justice is to \"start afresh\" with a new hearing before the RPD. The Minister relies on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Chandler: where a denial of natural justice taints the whole proceeding, the tribunal must start afresh.20\n[61] The Respondent maintains that the RAD should confirm the RPD's decision to accept his refugee claim. The Respondent also argues that the Minister will not be prejudiced if the RAD instead remains seized of the matter pending the outcome of the security screening process, as the Minister could send the case to an admissibility hearing following a report under Section 44 of IRPA.\n[62] In the RAD's view, the only appropriate remedy for the breach of natural justice in this matter is to refer the matter to the RPD for redetermination. Other proposed solutions-such as the Minister's ability to make a vacation application under Section 109(1), or refer the matter for an admissibility hearing under Section 44(2)-do not fully remedy the breach. In both those instances, the Minister would bear the onus of proving his case, while the Respondent bears the onus to establish his claim before the RPD. A vacation application would require the Minister to prove material misrepresentation,21 while inadmissibility considers a different issue, the risk posed to Canada by a foreign national. If the RAD were to remain seized of the matter, the Minister would lose his ability to suspend the claim while pursuing an inadmissibility determination, a right which only exists when the claim is before the RPD.\n[63] For these reasons, the RAD sets aside the decision granting refugee status to the Respondent and refers his claim back to the RPD for redetermination.\nDISPOSITION\n[64] The Minister's appeal rests on the concept of procedural fairness and natural justice. The RAD recognizes, however, that allowing this appeal also has the potential to create a very significant injustice to the Respondent. He made his refugee claim, was found to be credible by the RPD, and was granted refugee protection. Through no fault of his own, that decision is now set aside, and he faces a new refugee determination hearing. Even if the results of the security screening are entirely favourable to him, he faces the risk of a different outcome to his claim after a fresh hearing before a different RPD panel.\n[65] The Minister argues, citing Chandler, that the RPD must start afresh. The RAD disagrees. If the security screening process discloses no new information, or only results in information favourable to the Respondent, the original RPD proceeding is not, in retrospect, tainted.\n[66] The Respondent's refugee claim is referred back to the RPD with the following directions. The matter is to be heard by the same RPD panel as initially heard the claim, if at all possible. The RPD is to consider and properly apply the Instructions Governing the Management of Refugee Protection Claims Awaiting Front-end Security Screening. In hearing and deciding the claim, the RPD is to consider only evidence arising out of the security screening and issues raised by that evidence, and is to accept the findings of the first RPD panel unless those findings are disturbed by the evidence and issues arising out of the security screening.\nCONCLUSION\n[67] Pursuant to Section 111(c) of IRPA, the Refugee Appeal Division refers the matter to the Refugee Protection Division for re-determination by the same panel, subject to the directions set out above. This appeal is allowed.\n(signed)\n\"Edward Bosveld\"\nEdward Bosveld\nOctober 30, 2013\nDate\nREFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION \/ MINISTER'S APPEAL \/ RELIGION \/ FRONT-END SECURITY SCREENING \/ PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS \/ FAILURE TO COMPLY \/ RAD RULES \/ LEGITIMATE EXPECTATION \/ EXTENSION OF TIME \/ STANDARD OF REVIEW \/ MALE \/ REFER THE MATTER \/ SOMALIA\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD.25.02 (April 9, 2013)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\nRAD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SAR : TB3-04221\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX (Appellant), citizen of Nigeria, appeals a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) dated April 11, 2019 rejecting his claim for refugee protection.\n[2] The Appellant fears persecution in Nigeria because of his refusal to join the Black Axe Confraternity (Black Axe), a cult like organization operating on campuses in Nigeria. He claims Black Axe members tried to recruit him when he was in his second year at the XXXX XXXX XXXX in Anambra State in 2013. The Appellant left school and relocated to Port Harcourt to study XXXX XXXX after he was attacked by four men, two of whom were the Black Axe members who tried to recruit him. The Appellant claims his father reported the attack to the police, and the father was also subsequently attacked by Black Axe members. The Appellant remained in Port Harcourt for about one year. He left Nigeria on XXXX XXXX, 2016 and went to the United States of America (USA). While in the USA, the Appellant got married and then divorced. After the marriage ended, the Appellant received a letter from US immigration requiring him to leave the country. The Appellant entered Canada irregularly on XXXX XXXX, 2018.\n[3] The RPD found the Appellant had a viable internal flight alternative (IFA) in Lagos.\n[4] The Appellant argues the RPD failed to apply the proper legal test for IFA; erred in making selective use of and\/or ignoring documentary evidence and breached natural justice by failing to properly review evidence prior to the hearing and consider post-hearing submissions.\n[5] The Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) dismisses the appeal. I agree with the RPD that the Appellant has a viable IFA in Lagos.\nAPPLICATIONS FOR NEW EVIDENCE\nSubsection 110(4) documents\n[6] The Appellant applies for the admission on three documents under subsection 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). I find the three documents meet the requirements of subsection 110(4) and the Raza\/Singh1 factors and allow their admission.\n[7] XXXX job postings:2 The Appellant seeks the admission of a number of advertising posts on the internet for XXXX jobs. I note the print out has the date of July 10, 2019, which is after the rejection of the Appellant's claim. I find the document is credible, as it appears to be a direct print-out from a search on XXXX jobs in Nigeria. It is also relevant as it relates to the issue of the reasonableness of an IFA and it is new as it highlights the current state of affairs for XXXX jobs in Nigeria.\n[8] WhatsApp messages and photos from the Appellant's brother:3 I admit the WhatsApp messages and photos from the Appellant's brother. There is no date on the document, but I accept the Appellant's statement in his affidavit that indicates the WhatsApp thread details an alleged \"recent\" attack on his brother at the family store in Enugo State and arose after the rejection of the claim. I find the document is relevant and new as it relates to the Appellant's allegation that the Black Axe continue to be a threat. It is credible, in that it appears to be a print-out of the WhatsApp thread.\n[9] Vanguard News: \"Rage of Cultists in Lagos\":4 I admit the article. The article is dated June 27, 2019. It arose after the rejection of the Appellant's claim. The article provides information on attacks by cult gangs in Lagos, which is relevant to the issue of whether the Appellant has a safe IFA in Lagos. I find the article to be credible, in that it is posted on Vanguard.com, which is a news website, and it provides some new information on the situation in Lagos.\nRule 29 Application\n[10] Social News: The Heinous Activities of the Black Axe Confraternity in Nigeria: 5 The Appellant seeks to admit an article on the Black Axe under Rule 29. The article provides information on violence committed by the Black Axe. Much of the article discusses violent acts from 2004 and 2005. However, the article also details the alleged August 2019 killing of a young student who refused to the join the Black Axe. I find the article is new and relevant to my assessment of a viable IFA for the Appellant. In addition, though the article is \"anonymous\", it was posted on http:\/\/www.naijayouthvoice.com.ng , which I find to be an online and operational website. The Appellant does not explain why this article was not submitted at the time the Appeal Record was perfected in July 2019. Given that the article mentions a death in August 2019, I find the Appellant could not reasonably have provided the document at the time of perfection. I admit the article.\nApplication for an oral hearing under subsection 110(6) of IRPA\n[11] I have discretion to hold a hearing under subsection 110(6) of IRPA if there is documentary evidence that raises a serious issue with respect to credibility, is central to the decision and that, if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the refugee claim. I find none of the new documents are central to my decision. I decline to hold an oral hearing and dismiss the application.\nANALYSIS\n[12] I agree with the RPD that the determinative issue in this case is whether the Appellant has a viable IFA in Lagos. If there is a safe haven for claimants in their own country, where they could live free from harm, they are expected to avail themselves of it, unless they can show it is objectively unreasonable or unduly harsh for them to do so.6 The IFA must be realistic, attainable and accessible.\n[13] The test for assessing an IFA is two-pronged and is set out in the Federal Court of Appeal's decision in Rasaratnam.7\n(1) The Board must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an IFA exists and\/or the claimant would not be personally subject to a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture in the IFA.\n(2) Moreover, the conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claim, for him to seek refuge there.\n[14] Both prongs must be satisfied to find that the Appellants have an IFA. Once the issue of IFA has been raised and the potential IFAs have been identified, the burden of proof rests with the Appellants to show that they do not have an IFA.\n[15] The onus is on the Appellant to establish that the proposed IFA is not viable.\nFirst Prong - Would the Appellant face a serious possibility of persecution, or a risk to life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture in Lagos\n[16] The Appellant argues he does not have a viable IFA in Lagos. He submits that the Black Axe has a presence throughout Nigeria, and as result, the Black Axe would be able to track down the Appellant in Lagos.\n[17] I agree with the Appellant that Black Axe has a presence throughout Nigeria, including Lagos. However, I find that this fact alone is not sufficient to establish a reasonable likelihood that the Appellant faces a serious possibility of persecution from the Black Axe in Lagos.\n[18] Objective documentary evidence in the National Documentation Package confirms that the Black Axe cult is a violent organization and operates in universities all over the country, including in Lagos. Documentation also indicates that Black Axe is also a criminal organization, operating not just in universities, but also in cities. The documentation also confirms that while at times persons who were not members of any cult have been harmed in the midst of Black Axe violence, violence and harm caused by Black Axe is primarily a result of clashes between university or rival cults, and those injured are primarily members of cults.\n[19] For example, RIR NGA104208 talks about Black Axe activities and fights in Buja, Delta, Lagos, Edo State, Ekiti and many other Nigerian states. This RIR provides an overview of Black Axe clashes with other cults between 2009 and 2012 in different universities throughout Nigeria. The RIR highlights some instances where persons who are not cult members have been killed, but the source for the RIR makes it clear that it is rival members of the cults who are at risk of cult violence.8\n[20] The RIR references an article from the Vanguard which also indicates that most of the violence attributed to Black Axe arises from clashes between it and other cults:\ncult wars between the Black Axe and the Eiye confraternities\nin which \"many people\" have been killed and \"several\" have been wounded in March 2012 in Ijanikin, including the death of a 26 year-old who was not a member of any cultgroup (Vanguard 19 Mar. 2012). The newspaper adds that there are \"daily killings and\nmaiming of rival members\" of Black Axe and Eiye confraternities in this area (ibid.). On\nand the Eiye confraternity in Ikorodu (Daily Independent 1 Aug. 2011; The Nation 29\nJuly 2011.9\n[21] The National Human Rights Council states that Black Axe and other cults do not engage in violent activities against those not involved in cult activities. However, the NHRC also notes that cults also attack anti-cult campaigners through clandestine intimidation and physical attacks.10\n[22] The Appellant submits that because he refused to join, he can be considered an anti-cult campaigner. I disagree. The evidence submitted by the Appellant is that he refused to join the Black Axe. There is no evidence to indicate that he is an anti-cult campaigner.\n[23] The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in suggesting that cult activities in Lagos are limited to inter-cult wars and therefore any person who is not a cult member is not at risk.11\n[24] I have considered the following points in the objective documentary evidence in coming to my decision:\n* The NHRC notes that cults also attack anti-cult campaigners through clandestine intimidation and physical attacks.12\n* The DFAT Country Report on Nigeria indicates that several cults now have a presence in high schools and on the streets and operate more like gangs rather than religious cults. The Report also notes that campus cults such as Black Axe target young male students for membership. Students who refuse to join may face intimidation, threats and sometimes violence. The Report states that \"Often the only way to escape unwanted campus cults is to change universities.\" DFAT was not aware of anyone being killed for leaving a cult.13\n* The article, Rage of cultists in Lagos, which I have accepted as new evidence, indicates an intensification of attacks by cults in Lagos and in post secondary institutions. It speaks of a 10 year old boy recruited into the Eiye Confraternity, and highlights cult links to robberies in Lagos.14\n* The article, Social News: The Heinous Activities of Confraternity in Nigeria, which I have accepted as new evidence, talks about Black Axe, their forced recruitment of individuals opposed to cults, and killings and shootings by the Black Axe in 2004 and 2005. The article also highlights the death of a young man who refused to join the Black Axe while being a student at the Federal Polytechnic Nekede, Imo State. The article notes that the Black Axe hunted him down to his home town in Enugu-ukwu, Anambra State.15 .\n[25] After having reviewed objective documentation on this issue, I accept that Black Axe is a violent cult and has groups in universities throughout Nigeria. I also agree that Black Axe is active in Lagos universities. In addition, I note that individuals who are not involved in the cult have been injured or killed during clashes between the Black Axe and rival cults, however, for the most part, violence is directed at members of rival cult groups.\n[26] I turn to the Appellant's personal circumstances.\n[27] The Appellant claims Black Axe tried to recruit the Appellant when he was at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in Anambra State in March 2013, and that he had a struggle with Black Axe members a few weeks later. He returned to his parents in Enugu State. In November 2013, he was ambushed by the same men who initially tried to recruit him as he was returning from the family store in Enugu. He claims the men were yelling at him to either join their group or be killed. This was reported to the police. The next morning, he claims that his father was attacked by members of the Black Axe. Shortly after this ambush, the Appellant went to study XXXX in Port Harcourt. In XXXX 2016, the Appellant travelled to the US. Between his departure to Port Harcourt in XXXX 2013 and his departure to the US in XXXX 2016, there is no evidence to indicate that Black Axe tried to locate him during this close to three-year period when he was still in Nigeria.\n[28] Having considered the objective documentary evidence and the evidence submitted by the Appellant at the RPD hearing and in this appeal, I am not satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that there is a serious possibility of the Appellant being persecuted or of the Appellant being personally subjected to a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger of torture if he relocates to Lagos.\n[29] First, while I note some individuals who are not members of cults have been injured or killed in cult violence, I find objective documentation is consistent in that the primary victims of cult violence is cult members, killed in attacks by cults.\n[30] Second, as indicated above, I find that the Black Axe operates in Lagos. Lagos is, however, a large, very populated capital city with a significant number of universities and colleges. As indicated by DFAT, often the only way to avoid the cults is to change universities or colleges. I find the size and number of universities provide a number of viable options on where the Appellant can live, or, if he chooses, to go to school, in Lagos without being located by the Black Axe.\n[31] Third, the Appellant testified that Black Axe cannot stop looking for him because they need to capture him to show how powerful Black Axe are. The onus is on the Appellant to demonstrate this. I find the Appellant has failed to provide evidence that the Black Axe keep records of those they have tried to recruit and tracks them down throughout Nigeria.\n[32] The Appellant's testimony is that members of the Black Axe ambushed or attacked him when he was at the university in Anambra State and also while he was returning from the family store in Enugu State. He also testified that his parents were attacked in Enugu State. In addition, he has provided a WhatsApp chat that indicates his two brothers were attacked in the family store in Enugu State. This evidence indicates that the Black Axe may be able to find the Appellant in Enugu State. However, there is no evidence that the Black Axe could locate him in the proposed IFA of Lagos.\n[33] Fourth, the Appellant testified that if he goes back to any school, including medical school, the Black Axe will find him. The idea that the Appellant will return to any school in Nigeria is speculative. Moreover, the Appellant has offered no evidence that supports the submission that Black Axe has the motivation or ability to track anyone to Lagos. I have reviewed the article accepted under subsection 110(4) of IRPA, Social News: The Heinous Activities of Confraternity in Nigeria. The article mentions a young man who refused to join a cult at a university in Imo State. He was located in his hometown in Anambra State. This confirms that the Black Axe may be able to locate students back to their hometown, as they did with the Appellant. However, it does not provide evidence that the Black Axe can or would track down and locate students who refused to join the cult in universities across Nigeria, including in Lagos.\n[34] Fifth, the Appellant also submits that if he is returned to Nigeria, he would have to visit his mother in the hospital and attend family events, such as weddings. This would cause him safety concerns as he says he could be tracked. I reject this submission. I am not called on to assess whether it would be safe for the Appellant to visit family members in his hometown. I have to decide if Lagos is a viable IFA for him.\n[35] The onus is on the Appellant to demonstrate that he faces, on a balance of probabilities, a serious possibility of persecution or a risk to his life, or of cruel and unusual punishment or a danger of torture in Lagos. The fact that Black Axe is active in Lagos does not, on its own, mean that Lagos is not a safe alternative for the Appellant. The fact that Black Axe may locate students who refuse to join their cult in their hometowns, also does not establish that Lagos is not a safe alternative.\n[36] I find the Appellant has failed to provide sufficient, credible evidence to support, on a balance of probabilities, that he would face a serious possibility of persecution or risk of harm, if he relocated to Lagos.\nSecond prong - The IFA is not objectively unreasonable\n[37] The Appellant is now a 28-year-old man. He is Christian and speaks English and Igbo. He has two years of university education in XXXX XXXX. He also has a certificate in XXXX, but no work experience in that field. He worked as an XXXX with XXXX XXXX for a few months when he was in the US. The Appellant claims he would like to return to university and study XXXX. The Appellant has parents and three siblings in Enugu State.\n[38] The Appellant must show that the proposed IFA is objectively unreasonable taking into account his personal circumstances. It is a high burden and requires \"actual and concrete evidence\".16 It is a high threshold that \"requires nothing less than the existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant.\"17\n[39] When assessing the reasonableness of a proposed IFA, I find the following considerations relevant.\n[40] Employment - The Appellant argued that he would not be able to survive in Lagos because he needs up to 10 years' experience before he can get a job in XXXX. I can appreciate the challenges any Nigerian would face trying to start a career with limited or no actual work experience in a trade. Nevertheless, I note that he was a member of the XXXX Association in Port Harcourt from 2014 to 2015, and he has two years of study in XXXX XXXX, which may assist in him finding employment. The Appellant may need to start as an apprentice XXXX, or complete his degree, and grow from there, or look for a different line of work.\n[41] The Appellant argues that there is widespread unemployment in Nigeria and he may not be able to secure any form of employment. I find this to be relevant to all Nigerians and is not particular to the Appellant. On the contrary, I find the fact that the Appellant has some university education, speaks English and Igbo, did work in the US, and seems to be a capable young man bodes well for employment opportunities for him in Lagos.\n[42] Education: I find that if the Appellant were to return to school, Lagos has a range of options to consider. Taking care in selecting the university or college, and considering which ones have strong cult confraternities, could help ensure that he attends one where Black Axe and other cults are not prevalent. In addition, I find the fact that he has already two years of XXXX XXXX may assist him, particularly if he chooses to complete that degree.\n[43] Social networks and family: The Appellant appears to have a close family who live in Enugu, who could support him in his relocation to Lagos. I note as well the Appellant is a Christian. He attends a church in Canada. Lagos would offer him opportunities to pursue his religion in a supporting environment.\n[44] I find it is objectively reasonable for the Appellant to relocate. Given the Federal Court of Appeal (FCA) has stated that an IFA will only be unreasonable if relocating would jeopardize the life and safety of the appellant,18 I find, given the Appellant's particular circumstances, that this high standard is not met.\nCONCLUSION\n[45] The appeal is dismissed. Pursuant to section 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), the RAD confirms the decision of RPD that the Appellant is not a Convention refugee.\n(signed)\nMadeleine Schwarz\nAugust 31, 2020\nDate\nMovement of Africa, including their rituals, oaths of secrecy, and use of\nsymbols or particular signs; whether they use force to recruit individuals;\ntheir treatment of anti-cultists (2009-November 2012), Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, 3 December, 2012, Response to Information Request (RIR), NGA104208.E.\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD File \/ Dossier de la SAR : TB9-16133\nRAD.25.02 (April 04, 2019)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n2\nImmigration and Refugee\nBoard of Canada\nRefugee Appeal Division\nCommission de l'immigration\net du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 du Canada\nSection d'appel des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s\nRAD.25.02 (April 04, 2019)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] The appeal is allowed.\n[2] The appellant, XXXX XXXX XXXX, is a citizen of Djibouti.\n[3] The appellant states that she fears for her life if she should return to Djibouti because she is a member of the Midgan minority clan and she is persecuted by a person in the majority clan. She states that she was rejected by her family because in 1995 she married a non-Muslim Ethiopian instead of a high-ranking police officer with close ties to those in power (XXXX XXXX), with whom her family had planned an arranged marriage. Her husband was threatened and chose to return to Ethiopia to protect her. She states that in 2002, she was abducted, raped and beaten by XXXX XXXX XXXX who still wanted to marry her. She claims that she lived in hiding from XXXX XXXX from 2015 until she left her country in 2017.\n[4] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejected the appellant's claim for the first time on March 6, 2017, but this decision was set aside by the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD), which referred the matter to the RPD for re-determination. On September 17, 2019, the RPD rejected the appellant's refugee protection claim a second time, namely because it found that her credibility was undermined by omissions, contradictions and inconsistencies in her testimony.\n[5] In her memorandum, in addition to the previously mentioned fears, the appellant states that she fears persecution in Djibouti because of her membership in the particular social group of [translation] \"women facing gender-related persecution\" and the treatment of refugee protection claimants who return to Djibouti. The appellant submits that the RPD erred as follows in its analysis of her refugee protection claim:\n- The RPD only focused on the evidence that weighed against her and ignored the evidence that weighed in her favour.\n- The RPD failed to observe the principle of natural justice because it did not comment on certain pieces of evidence submitted by the appellant (P3 to P-6).\n- The RPD did not demonstrate the sensitivity and understanding required by Guideline 4.\n- The RPD erred in not conducting a [translation] \"gender-based [analysis] based on evidence of violence against women in Djibouti.\"\n[6] The determinative issue for the RAD is the prospective risk.\nANALYSIS\n[7] My role is to examine all of the evidence and determine whether the RPD's decision is correct.1\nCredibility\n[8] The RPD found that the appellant's testimony was credible for the period from 1994 to 2002. After that, the RPD found that the appellant's testimony was vague and sometimes contradictory, and that it did not establish that appellant faces persecution in Djibouti. On appeal, the appellant argues, in particular, that the RPD should have applied the presumption of truthfulness and considered her explanations. Furthermore, in her opinion, the omissions and contradictions the RPD noted in her testimony are not related to the basis of her refugee protection claim.\n[9] In analyzing the appellant's refugee protection claim, I considered the Guideline on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution (Guideline 4), especially section D, which mentions that women from societies where the preservation of one's dignity or marital dignity is the cultural norm may be reluctant to disclose their experiences of violence in order to keep their feeling of \"shame\" to themselves. Such violence against a woman may cause difficulty in concentration, an attitude of self-blame, memory loss or distortion and a reluctance to testify.\n[10] Like the RPD, I am of the view that the appellant did not present any evidence to corroborate her statements, but unlike the RPD, I think one must be careful before drawing a negative inference based on a lack of corroborative evidence.2\n[11] As the RPD hearing recording is not on the appeal record, I am unable to confirm the omissions or contradictions raised by the RPD in the appellant's testimony. And even if I could, the RPD's findings that doubt the appellant's credibility do not seem sufficient to me to rebut the presumption of truthfulness, all the more so because it found the appellant's testimony to be credible up to 2002, when she was abducted, raped and beaten by XXXX XXXX. Yes, the appellant ideally should have provided more details in her testimony, or reported the help received from a friend to leave Djibouti in her written account, but this information is not central to her refugee protection claim. The same holds true for the discrepancies the RPD identified between the appellant's testimony and the documents filled out at the border when she arrived in Canada. With regard to the behaviour considered to be inconsistent with the appellant's fear, namely that she did not consider the fact that XXXX XXXX could have been working at the airport the day she left, this was speculation proposed by the RPD.\n[12] There are aspects of the appellant's story that leave me perplexed. For example, why did she decide to live in hiding only from 2015? Similarly, I have some doubts, particularly with regard to what actual threats the appellant received from XXXX XXXX after 2002. Despite everything, I conclude that there are not sufficient reasons to doubt the credibility of the appellant's oral and written testimony with regard to her fear of persecution in Djibouti from XXXX XXXX or as a single woman who is part of a minority clan.\n[13] In a legal textbook, Professor Hilary Evans Cameron relies on relevant case law in stating the opinion that the notion of the benefit of the doubt is fundamental to refugee law and that it should guide decision-makers facing a degree of doubt after analyzing all of the evidence:\n\"When the Court uses this wording, it highlights the fact that when all is said and done, the member may be left in doubt. Since the presumption of truthfulness decrees that this doubt may not harm the claimant unless the member can find valid reasons to support it, if she cannot quantify her suspicions, she will simply have to accept the evidence that she distrusts-she may even have to accept evidence that she strongly believes is untrue.\"3\n[14] In this context, I conclude that the appellant established that there was more than a mere possibility that she would be persecuted by XXXX XXXX, should she return to Djibouti.\nGender-based persecution\n[15] In addition to fearing XXXX XXXX, the appellant fears persecution because she is a woman in Djibouti. The appellant states that, as a woman, she would be vulnerable if she had to return to Djibouti, where, according to the documentary evidence, violence is widespread. She claims that the RPD erred in not considering her weak economic situation and the absence of male protection. She argues that the authorities do not have the will or the resources to protect single women from minority clans. Lastly, the appellant submits that it is not possible for her to find refuge elsewhere in Djibouti.\n[16] The Chairperson's guideline indicates that when the violence feared by a person is a serious violation of a fundamental right for a Convention ground and there is a failure of state protection, it can be concluded that that person is a refugee.\n[17] In this case, the appellant suffered serious physical abuse, including female genital mutilation as a child and sexual assault, acts that are certainly serious violations of fundamental rights.\n[18] I have read the objective evidence about the current situation in Djibouti, especially that which concerns the situation of women.\n[19] According to the documentary evidence, women in Djibouti experience serious human rights' violations, including discrimination and violence. The reports indicate that women suffer legal and social discrimination, including, but not limited to, discrimination affecting freedom of movement, employment, housing, inheritance and property. Although there is a law against rape, it does not address spousal rape, and the law is not enforced effectively. Furthermore, domestic violence is a widespread problem. Women rarely report such assaults to the authorities; police rarely intervene in domestic violence incidents and often, these problems are handled by families and clans. There is no law against sexual harassment, which is a widespread problem.4\n[20] Considering all of the evidence, I note that the appellant's fears are consistent with the objective evidence and the situation in Djibouti. Given all of the information on the record and the appellant's profile as a single woman from a minority clan, I conclude that she has established that she faces a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, namely that of being a member of the particular social group of women fearing gender-based violence and persecution.\nState protection\n[21] The appellant must provide clear and convincing evidence that the Djiboutian state would be unwilling or unable to provide adequate protection with regard to the alleged risks.\n[22] As explained above, the panel considered the objective evidence on the current situation in Djibouti and the appellant's profile. According to the evidence, discrimination and violence against women is a serious and widespread problem. However, the authorities are trying to counter this violence and discrimination; for example, Djibouti has adopted a law to protect women's rights against discrimination. However, the laws are not applied effectively at all times. According to the same evidence, there are serious corruption and impunity problems among authorities. The risks faced by women and girls are not limited to one particular region, they are widespread.\n[23] Given all of this information and for all of the reasons explained above, I conclude that state protection would not be adequate for the appellant at this time, considering the particular facts of this case.\n[24] Djibouti is a small country with a population of less than one million. Considering all of the evidence on the record and for all of the reasons explained above, it is objectively unreasonable, at present and in the circumstances, including those particular to the appellant, to seek refuge elsewhere in Djibouti. There is currently a serious possibility of persecution for the appellant everywhere in Djibouti and, because of this, there is no viable internal flight alternative for her right now.\nCONCLUSION\n[25] The appeal is allowed. I set aside the determination of the RPD and substitute my own determination that the appellant is a Convention refugee.\n(signed)\nTammy Tremblay\nMe Tammy Tremblay\nDecember 8, 2020\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD File No. \/ No de dossier de la SAR : VB9-07811\nRAD.25.02 (January 2020)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n7\nImmigration and Refugee\nBoard of Canada\nRefugee Appeal Division\nCommission de l'immigration\net du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 du Canada\nSection d'appel des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s\nRAD.25.02 (January 2020)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX his spouse, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and their children XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX (Appellants) are citizens of Mexico who have appealed a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejecting their claims for refugee protection. For the reasons that follow, their appeal is denied.\n[2] The Appellants fear that they would be killed or seriously harmed by members of the Cartel de Jalisco Nueva Generaci\u00f3n (CJNG) if they return to Mexico. Mr. XXXX XXXX owned a business in which he made and delivered XXXX in Acatic in Jalisco state. He was targeted for extortion by the CJNG from 2012 until he could no longer pay extortion money in 2017. In early 2017, the Appellants went to visit Ms. XXXX XXXX parents in Guadalajara, also in Jalisco state. On their way home, the CJNG trapped them and asked if they had gone to the police. When Mr. XXXX XXXX said they had not, the CJNG told them not to otherwise he would pay the consequences in the most painful way because they would come after him and his family. The Appellants left Mexico and arrived in Canada in XXXX 2017. They claimed refugee status in August 2018.\n[3] The RPD generally found the Appellants' evidence about the events they experienced in Mexico to be credible. However, it did not agree with the inferences and speculations made by the Appellants based on the events they described. The RPD found that the Appellants had a viable internal flight alternative in M\u00e9rida in Yucat\u00e1n state. Based on the evidence, it found that the CJNG was unlikely to track them down in M\u00e9rida, on a balance of probabilities. The Appellants challenge the RPD's findings in relation to the internal flight alternative issue.\n[4] For the reasons set out below, I do not agree with any of the reasons that the Appellants have provided for why they believe that the RPD erred with respect to the internal flight alternative issue. I find that the RPD was correct to find that the Appellants would have a viable internal flight alternative to M\u00e9rida.\nROLE OF THE RAD\n[5] The Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) reviews decisions of the RPD on a standard of correctness after conducting an independent assessment of the evidence before it.1 The exception to this rule is that the RAD may apply a deferential standard in some circumstances.2 I have conducted my own independent assessment of all the evidence in this case, including the audio-recording of the hearing. Unless specifically stated and explained below, I have applied a correctness standard in this case.\nANALYSIS\n[6] The Appellants do not dispute the RPD's finding that their allegations have no nexus to a ground of persecution contained in the refugee Convention. This finding was correct; therefore, the Appellants' claims must be decided under s. 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) which is the section that provides protections for persons in need of protection.\nNo error under first prong of the internal flight alternative analysis\n[7] The RPD did not err in finding that the evidence did not establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellants would be subjected personally to a risk to their lives, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture in M\u00e9rida.\n[8] The RPD rejected the Appellants' testimony at the hearing that the CJNG would find them anywhere in Mexico. It gave two main reasons for this finding. First, even if a newspaper article submitted by the Appellants reported that the CJNG was contesting territory in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, read as a whole, the documentary evidence did not establish that the CJNG had any meaningful influence over territory in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. The second main reason provided by the RPD was the fact that, despite knowing where Mr. XXXX XXXX family lives in Acatic, the CJNG had not asked them about the Appellants after their departure from Mexico.\nNo error due to failure to mention evidence\n[9] I do not agree with the Appellants that the RPD erred in failing to specifically refer to certain parts of the Appellants' evidence in its analysis. At para. 3 of their memorandum, the Appellants list five parts of their evidence that were accepted by the RPD and they argue that the RPD erred in not specifically referring to two of these parts in its decision. The two were the CJNG's ambush of the Appellants upon their return from visiting Ms. XXXX XXXX parents in Guadalajara in early XXXX 2017 and the Appellants' evidence that the CJNG perceived them to be wealthy.\n[10] Even if the RPD did not explicitly refer to the ambush and the perception of wealth, it is presumed to have taken into consideration all of the evidence. In any event, I do not find that these factors alter the conclusion that the CJNG would not be likely, on a balance of probabilities, to track the Appellants down in M\u00e9rida. While I accept that the fact that the CJNG may have known that the Appellants left their home to go to Ms. XXXX XXXX parents place in Guadalajara shows a certain degree of interest in the Appellants, the fact remains that Guadalajara is located in Jalisco state which is the CJNG's home base. Therefore, I do not agree with the Appellants that this incident alters the RPD's conclusion that the CJNG are unlikely to track the Appellants down in a state more than 1800 kilometers away where they have no meaningful control or influence. I note further that the fact that there was no evidence of the CJNG ever returning to ask Ms. XXXX XXXX parents about the Appellants' whereabouts further supports the second factor relied upon by the RPD-that is, the CJNG's failure to contact the Appellants' family members to ask about their whereabouts after they left Mexico.\n[11] With respect to the RPD's failure to mention the Appellants' evidence that the CJNG perceived them to be wealthy, I note, to begin, that this was the Appellants' perception of what the CJNG thought. Even if Mr. XXXX XXXX was able to buy an expensive house with an inheritance he received after his mother's death, they also testified that he ran a XXXX business. Even if the CJNG did perceive the Appellants to be wealthy, at most, this might mean an increased interest in them. In my view, this evidence still does not outweigh the two most significant factors relied upon by the RPD set out above as to why the evidence did not establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the CJNG was likely to track the Appellants down in M\u00e9rida.\n[12] For these reasons, I do not agree with the Appellants that the RPD erred in omitting to mention certain parts of the Appellants' evidence in its decision.\nRPD did not selectively use country conditions evidence of the CJNG's violent practices\n[13] I do not agree with the Appellants that the RPD erred in failing to specifically refer to the articles submitted by the Appellants in their post-hearing submissions which are listed at para. 17 of their memorandum of appeal. All of the articles listed by the Appellants speak to the importance of extortion for cartels like the CJNG and the brutal level of violence displayed by the CJNG. None of the articles provided information to support the Appellants' allegation that the CJNG were likely to track them down in M\u00e9rida in Yucat\u00e1n state. The only article listed by the Appellants that comes close to being relevant to this issue is an article indicating that many of the murders in Mexico can be chalked up to the CJNG's push for territory. However, the article goes on to state that vast burial sites have been discovered in states where the cartel has been most aggressive, like Veracruz. The article does not indicate that the CJNG is making a push for territory in the Yucat\u00e1n. For these reasons, I disagree with the Appellants that the RPD erred by failing to refer to the articles they listed at para. 17 of their memorandum.\nNo error in assessment of CJNG's presence in Yucat\u00e1n state\n[14] I do not agree with the Appellants that the RPD erred in its assessment of the documentary evidence in relation to the CJNG's activities in Yucat\u00e1n state.\n[15] The Appellants refer to four documents that they say the RPD failed to properly take into consideration in this case. They argue that the four documents establish that the CJNG has a presence in Yucat\u00e1n states. I disagree.\n[16] The Appellants are correct to state that the report from the Congressional Research Service found at Tab 7.2 of the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Mexico indicates that the CJNG has national reach and that it is entering new areas as other cartels have weakened.3 However, the report specifically identifies the areas in which the CJNG has expanded at p. 30 of the report and Yucat\u00e1n state is not one of them. The report also indicates that the CJNG has battled factions of other cartels in Tabasco, Veracruz and Buanajuato. Again, there is no mention of Yucat\u00e1n state. Finally, the report includes a map at p. 33 which shows the territory over which the CJNG has influence as well as contested territory. The CJNG is not shown to have any influence in Yucat\u00e1n state.\n[17] While the Appellants did submit an academic journal article from 2018 which has a brief mention in a table contained in the document that the CJNG is disputing leadership with rivals or has an alliance in the Yucat\u00e1n, the journal does not otherwise mention the CJNG having meaningful influence in the Yucat\u00e1n. In addition, as noted by the RPD, the Appellants submitted a news article from 2018 which stated that the CJNG was contesting territory in the Yucat\u00e1n. In my view, the RPD did not err in preferring to rely upon a more recent research report from 2019 that is found at Tab 7.21 of the NDP for Mexico.4 Like the report at Tab 7.2, the report at Tab 7.21 does not indicate that the CJNG has any influence in Yucat\u00e1n state. I would add that a 2019 article from InSight Crime found at Tab 7.12 of the NDP for Mexico also does not indicate that the CJNG has influence in Yucat\u00e1n State. At p. 2, the report lists 22 states in which the CJNG operates and the list does not include Yucat\u00e1n state.5 In addition, as noted by the RPD, the documentary evidence establishes that Yucatan state is the most peaceful state in Mexico with the lowest homicide rate and the third-lowest violent crime rate.6\n[18] Based on the above, I find that the RPD did not err in relying upon the most recent evidence contained in the NDP for Mexico to find that the CJNG has no meaningful influence in the Yucat\u00e1n. It also did not err in considering this to be a significant factor supporting its conclusion that the CJNG was unlikely, on a balance of probabilities, to track the Appellants down in M\u00e9rida on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.\nRPD did not apply incorrect test\n[19] I disagree with the Appellants that the RPD applied an incorrect test by requiring a guarantee that the CJNG would track the Appellants down in M\u00e9rida. There is absolutely no merit to this claim. The paragraphs that the Appellants point to are paragraphs 6 and 11 of the RPD's decision. In both those paragraphs, the RPD correctly stated the test as requiring evidence showing \"on a balance of possibilities\" that the Appellants would personally be subjected to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture.\nThe RPD did not rely on speculation\n[20] I do not agree with the Appellants that the RPD erred in rejecting their inferences while instead basing its decision on its own speculative inferences.\n[21] Even accepting that the CJNG had extorted the Appellants for five years, ambushed them on their way back from Guadalajara, and warned them not to go to the police or the would suffer the consequences, none of the above are sufficient to establish that the CJNG would likely consider them to be valuable enough targets to track them into territory where they have no meaningful influence. Moreover, the CJNG's failure to contact any of the Appellants' family members who still reside in Acatic or elsewhere in Jalisco state is further evidence on which the RPD correctly concluded that the CJNG likely does not have the kind of interest and motivation necessary to invest the resources to track them down in M\u00e9rida.\n[22] For the reasons set out in paragraphs 13-18 above, I do not agree that the documentary evidence submitted by the Appellants supported their claim that the CJNG was likely to track them down in M\u00e9rida.\n[23] I also do not agree that the RPD's assessment was illogical or speculative. As noted in paragraph 17 above, the RPD's assessment was supported by the most recent documentary evidence before it which was the 2019 evidence in the NDP for Mexico.\n[24] I also do not agree with the Appellants that the RPD erred in its reliance upon the CJNG's failure to approach their family members who remained in Acatic. The Appellants misunderstand the point being made by the RPD when they argue that the Appellants are a better target than Mr. XXXX XXXX parents who are people of limited means. As noted by the RPD, the CJNG has not approached the Appellants' family members who remain in Acatic or elsewhere in Jalisco state to ask about the Appellants' whereabouts. If the CJNG had a significant interest in tracking the Appellants down, it is to be expected that one of the first things they would do is to approach their family to ask where they are. However, they have not done so. I do not find that the RPD erred in relying upon this factor to find that the CJNG likely do not have the interest or motivation necessary to track the Appellants down in Yucat\u00e1n state.\n[25] I disagree with the Appellants' arguments regarding the CJNG's alleged push for control in the Yucat\u00e1n. As stated above, the RPD correctly relied upon the most recent evidence to find that the CJNG has no meaningful influence in Yucat\u00e1n state.\n[26] Finally, I do not find relevant any of the documents from the NDP for Mexico cited by the Appellants at a paragraphs 65-74 of their memorandum. All of this evidence is general evidence regarding police corruption and the links between cartels and the police. In my view, none of this evidence establishes that the CJNG would have the interest or motivation to track the Appellants down in M\u00e9rida where they have no meaningful influence.\nNo error under second prong of the internal flight alternative test\n[27] I do not agree with the Appellants that the RPD erred in finding that it was not unreasonable to expect the Appellants to relocate to M\u00e9rida in the circumstances of this case.\nNo error in finding about Ms. XXXX XXXX mental health issues\n[28] I do not take issue with the case law cited by the Appellants about the treatment of psychological reports that indicate a significant risk of re-traumatization if a claimant returns to their country. However, the RPD correctly found that neither of the two reports submitted by the Appellants spoke to any anticipated impacts on Ms. XXXX XXXX mental health of a return to Mexico or of a relocation to M\u00e9rida in particular. Therefore, the RPD correctly found that the reports did not establish that Ms. XXXX XXXX life and safety would be jeopardized if the Appellants were to relocate to M\u00e9rida.\n[29] I also do not agree with the Appellants that Ms. XXXX XXXX subjective fear of returning to Mexico is a key factor, the key issue is the objective reality of whether the Appellants could live safely in M\u00e9rida and whether it is objectively reasonable to expect them to relocate there. For the reasons set out above, any subjective fear on Ms. XXXX XXXX part that the CJNG would likely track the Appellants down in M\u00e9rida is not supported by the objective evidence in this case. In addition, as correctly pointed out by the RPD, there was no evidence to suggest that Ms. XXXX XXXX would not be able to access health care and treatment in M\u00e9rida if she were to experience an escalation in symptoms upon relocating there.\n[30] Finally, I do not agree with the Appellants that the RPD erred in finding that Mr. XXXX XXXX would likely be able to find employment of the kind he performed in Mexico or that he currently performs in Canada which would be sufficient to support the Appellants in M\u00e9rida. While the Appellants argue that the exact machine that Mr. XXXX XXXX uses in Canada does not exist in Mexico, there is no reason to believe that Mr. XXXX XXXX would be unable to find a similar job as a XXXX in M\u00e9rida. Even if Mr. XXXX XXXX is allegedly illiterate and must care for his wife, he faced the same circumstances while he was in Mexico and was able to run his own tortilla business before the Appellants left. There is no credible and reliable evidence that would establish that he would not be able to perform similar work in M\u00e9rida.\nCONCLUSION\n[31] For the above reasons, the RAD dismisses the appeal. I confirm the decision of the RPD that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n(signed)\n\"Jo-Anne Pickel\"\nMe Jo-Anne Pickel\nJanuary 24, 2020\nDate\nJP\/tm\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD File \/ Dossier de la SAR : VB9- 08549\nVB9- 08550\/ VB9- 08551\/ VB9- 08552\nVB9- 08553\nRAD.25.02 (April 04, 2019)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n7\nImmigration and Refugee\nBoard of Canada\nRefugee Appeal Division\nCommission de l'immigration\net du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 du Canada\nSection d'appel des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s\nRAD.25.02 (April 04, 2019)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] This appeal is dismissed. The Appellant, XXXX XXXX XXXX, is a citizen of Nigeria who appeals the negative determination of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD). The Appellant claimed refugee protection based on religious persecution by a radical group. The RPD rejected the Appellant's claim for refugee protection because he has a viable Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) in Port Harcourt, Rivers State.\nThe Basis of Claim\n[2] The Appellant and his late brother converted from Islam to Christianity. The Appellant claimed that he and his brother were threatened, robbed and assaulted by a radical Islamic group who opposed their Christian faith. On January 14, 2010, the Appellant's brother, who was a local XXXX XXXX, was abducted, tortured, and murdered by the same group. The Appellant relocated to Lagos and left his job at the XXXX to avoid the same harm. Some members of the group, including XXXX, were arrested after they were reported to the police. Despite the subsequent conviction of the people in the radical group, the Appellant continued to experience threats, arson, and abduction by unknown persons. The Appellant fears a risk to his life perpetrated by the same group who killed his brother.1\nThe RPD decision\n[3] The determinative issue at the RPD was the existence of a viable IFA in Port Harcourt, Rivers State. The RPD drew a negative credibility inference from the absence of corroborating evidence related to XXXX, who was put on trial for committing violent offences within the extremist group; and the connection between the Appellant's problems in Kano State with threatening phone calls and the kidnapping that occurred in Lagos State.2 The RPD noted the absence of XXXX name or the name of any specific group in the documentary evidence to support a negative credibility inference.\n[4] The RPD drew an analogy with the appellant in the Jurisprudential Guide (JG) TB7-19851 and found the Appellant's testimony and Basis of Claim (BOC) narrative to be insufficient evidence to establish the Appellant's fear of persecution.3 The RPD relied on the now revoked JG to conclude that most Nigerians facing non-state agents can safely relocate to another large urban centre. Even if the agents of persecution are able to influence corrupt police officers in Kano State or Lagos, the Appellant can remain safe from corrupt police officers by not registering a change of address in Port Harcourt and refraining from registering his address would not result in a denial of civic rights in healthcare and education.4\nThe Appellant's arguments at the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD)\n[5] The Appellant submitted that IFA is the determinative issue in this appeal.5 The Appellant argued that the RPD erred in its requirement for corroboration, in its assessment of the supporting evidence, and in its assessment of Port Harcourt as the IFA.\nDECISION\n[6] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[7] The Appellant submitted an affidavit sworn by him as new evidence6 in support of this appeal. I considered the admission of this affidavit as new evidence even though he states in the affidavit that he is not relying on new documentary evidence, and he is not requesting an oral hearing pursuant to section 110(6) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\n[8] Pursuant to section 110(4) of IRPA,7 with the exception of paragraph 16, I reject the affidavit as new evidence for reasons that the affidavit merely restates the arguments made in the Memorandum; the affidavit summarizes the key points of the Appellant's testimony which supports his arguments; and the affidavit merely refers to the documentary evidence presented at the RPD. Therefore, with the exception of paragraph 16, the affidavit does not meet the criteria in section 110(4) of IRPA of being evidence that arose after the rejection of the claim, that was not reasonably available, or that the Appellant could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented at the time of the rejection.8\n[9] I accept paragraph 16 of the affidavit as new evidence, as the information therein could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have been brought to the RPD before its decision, because the paragraph is in response to the RPD's finding that travelling to Port Harcourt does not present an undue hardship.9 The Appellant stated in paragraph 16 of his affidavit that the Nigerian police are present in Nigerian airports, and he believes that the agents of persecution are using their connections with the police to do their \"dirty jobs\".\n[10] Turning to the Singh and Raza factors,10 paragraph 16 is relevant to the first prong of the IFA test - whether the Appellant demonstrated a serious possibility of persecution in the proposed IFA. The paragraph contains new evidence regarding the Appellant's subjective fear upon his return to Nigeria. The paragraph is credible as the presumption of truth has not been rebutted.\nROLE OF THE RAD\n[11] The standard of review at the RAD is correctness on questions of law, fact, or mixed fact and law.11 The RAD can defer to an RPD finding where the RPD had a meaningful advantage in assessing the credibility of oral testimony.12 The RAD carries out its own analysis of the record, on a correctness standard, to determine whether the RPD erred.13 As the RPD had no meaningful advantage in the assessment of oral testimony in this case, I apply the standard of correctness in the review of the RPD decision.\nANALYSIS\nThe RPD's negative credibility findings are set aside\n[12] It is an error to draw a negative credibility inference from the mere absence of corroborative documentary evidence unless the Appellant's credibility is in issue.14 In the RAD's independent review of the evidence, I find the RPD erred in drawing a negative inference from the absence of XXXX name in the documentary evidence. According to the BOC narrative and the testimony, the Appellant feared a militant Islamic group which he believed later affiliated itself with Boko Haram, and XXXX was one of the men in the militant group. Based on my independent review, I agree with the Appellant's argument that it is the militant group, and not XXXX, who is the principal agent of persecution. The Appellant testified that when he was attacked, he recognized XXXX, who was his brother's acquaintance, amongst the other members of the group;15 the Appellant did not testify that XXXX has a high profile in the country. I agree with the Appellant's argument that there is no rational basis to expect XXXX to be specifically named in the NDP evidence.16\n[13] Since the Appellant testified that he could not recall if he reported XXXX to the police,17 I find no credibility issues in the testimony which would require corroborative documentary evidence to prove the existence of XXXX. While it would have assisted the Appellant's case if XXXX was named in the police reports and supporting affidavits, the absence of his name in those documents is a neutral consideration that does not support a negative credibility finding.\nThe Appellant's subjective fear of religious persecution is established in the evidence\n[14] The RAD's independent review of the testimony and the documentary evidence supports a finding that the Appellant has a forward-facing fear of religious persecution in Kano State and in Lagos. There are police reports which document the Appellant and his brother being burgled, harassed, and threatened in Kano State in 2009 due to his brother's activities as a XXXX XXXX.18 A police report documents the Appellant's brother was murdered in Lagos, and a death certificate is proof of his death in Lagos.19\nThe Appellant has an internal flight alternative in Port Harcourt\n[15] Since the JG was revoked on April 7, 2020, I will conduct an independent analysis of the recent country conditions evidence to determine if the Appellant has a viable IFA in Port Harcourt.\n[16] I find the RPD erred in not conducting an individualized assessment when it merely equated the perpetrator in the JG with the perpetrator in this appeal on the mere basis that both are non-state agents of persecution. Whereas the JG involved a single woman who feared her father who tried to force her into a marriage and into female genital mutilation (FGM), the Appellant in this appeal fears religious persecution from a militant religious group.\n[17] However, having independently reviewed the Appellant's evidence and the objective evidence related to Port Harcourt, I arrive at the same finding as the RPD that the Appellant has a viable IFA in Port Harcourt.\nLaw on IFA\n[18] The onus of proof is on the claimant to demonstrate a serious possibility of persecution throughout the country, including the area identified as the IFA.20 The test for whether an IFA exists is two-pronged:\na. The claimant must demonstrate a serious possibility of persecution in the proposed IFA.\nb. The second prong of the test asks whether it is objectively reasonable to expect the claimant to seek safety in another part of the country before seeking refuge elsewhere. In other words, would it be unduly harsh to expect this person, who is being persecuted in one part of the country, to move to another part of the country before seeking refugee status abroad.\n[19] The second prong of the test of unreasonableness is set at a high standard, requiring nothing less than concrete evidence of the existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of the claimant to travel to or to temporarily relocate to the safe area.21 If there is a safe haven in the claimant's own country where the claimant will be free of persecution, the claimant is expected to avail themselves of the IFA, unless they can show it is objectively unreasonable to do so.\nFirst prong: Does the Appellant have a serious possibility of persecution in the proposed IFA?\n[20] I have considered the Appellant's argument that if the agents of persecution can influence the corrupt police, they can also use their influence to find the Appellant given the personal and biometric information collected from all Nigerians when they open a bank account and purchase a mobile phone with a SIM card.22 I am not persuaded by this argument as there is insufficient objective country conditions evidence to support a finding that personal information collected in the banking and mobile phone sectors will lead to a serious possibility of persecution in Port Harcourt.\n[21] The objective evidence indicates that SIM card registration in Nigeria has been poor and there is a proliferation of unregistered SIM cards in Nigeria. Nigerian telecom regulations provide that the mobile subscriber information in central databases can only be provided to security agencies, and the request must be made in writing by an official of the requesting Security Agency, who is at the rank of an Assistant Commissioner of Police or higher, or a coordinate rank of any other security agency. Otherwise, the mobile service provider must obtain the subscriber's written consent before disclosing a subscriber's personal information to a third party that is not a security agency. Apart from the regulations, there is little information about third party access to SIM card and bank account information.23\n[22] A person who opens a bank account in Nigeria requires a bank verification number which is obtained after providing their biometric data, namely, their fingerprints and facial image captured to a centralized database. Third party access to such information by law enforcement agencies, other financial institutions and credit bureaus requires a valid court order.24 The evidence indicates the existence of fraudsters who attempt to dupe bank account holders into providing their bank verification number; however, the objective evidence does not suggest how the radical militant group would obtain access to the Appellant's bank verification number or personal data in order to locate the Appellant in Port Harcourt. In fact, an expert in the objective evidence indicated that there needs to be a high level of collusion, compromise, and system breakdown for bank accounts to be opened using a person's bank verification number obtained fraudulently. This objective evidence indicates that the banking system is not weakened by corruption25 in the same way that corruption exists within the Nigerian police. As such, there is a lack of objective evidence to make an inference that corruption in the police force would make the banking system vulnerable to corruption which would create a risk of the Appellant's identity and residential information being leaked to the agents of persecution. It would be speculative to make such an inference where there is a lack of objective evidence.\n[23] I have considered the Appellant's testimony that since 2009, he was abducted and harassed by multiple people.26 He gave detailed testimony about the militant group storming his brother's XXXX and assaulting his brother, which is corroborated by the police report.27 The Appellant testified that he does not consider it safe to move to another place because the agents of persecution are able to search for him in Lagos, Kanos State and Port Harcourt.28 The Appellant believes he was targeted by the militant group because he and his brother were Muslim and became Christian converts, and his brother came from southern Nigeria to convert people in the north. The militant group knew this information from XXXX, his brother's acquaintance.29\n[24] Even though his brother is dead, he believes the militant group is motivated to continue pursuing him because he believes the attack was directed at both of them. Also, the Appellant believes he is being targeted in retaliation for his reporting the militant group to the police which led to their arrest. In 2009, thugs broke into his home in Ogun State for the second time.30 He inferred from the escalation of violence against him and his brother in 2012 that the perpetrators were Boko Haram.31\n[25] The Appellant fled Kanos to escape the agents of persecution, but the agents of persecution located him in Lagos and Ogun State. The BOC narrative states that after he relocated to Lagos, he resigned from his banking job, maintained a low profile, and changed his address and mobile numbers. After taking these steps, he stopped receiving threatening messages. But the agents of harm located the Appellant again. The Appellant believes that he was found in Lagos based on his information displayed on his new company's website. Despite the arrests and conviction of members of the group, he continued to receive threats at home and at work. In June 2017, his family home in Otta, Ogun State was set on fire by an unknown person, although he suspected it was from the group because they had threatened to do so. The Appellant believes the group abducted him on his way home from work in February 2018 in retaliation for reporting the group to the police.32\n[26] Although the Appellant was threatened and abducted in Lagos, the RAD's independent review indicates a lack of objective evidence to support a finding of a serious possibility of persecution in Port Harcourt by the militant religious group. The Appellant filed media articles describing radical Muslim groups operating in northern Nigeria have called for an Iranian-style Islamic revolution in Nigeria, and that such groups may evolve into Boko Haram. But the conflict brought by these militant groups is limited to the north and the central or Middle Belt regions of Nigeria.33\n[27] The most recent objective National Documentation Package (NDP) evidence indicates that Boko Haram operates in the northeast of Nigeria: rarely do they operate outside their home territory, and they do not operate in the south to the coastal areas. There is reference to attempted attacks in Lagos in 2014, but its reach into southern Nigeria is limited or absent in major cities, such as Lagos and Port Harcourt, because that part of Nigeria is majority Christian and comprises many different ethnic groups.34\n[28] Christians make up 46 percent of the population of 203 million people in Nigeria.35 Although religious freedom is compromised for some Islamic sects, religious freedom is protected in Nigeria for Christians, except in the north-eastern region where Boko Haram is a security threat.36 Religious conflict exists in north-central Nigeria involving Muslim Fulani herders and settled farmers who are both Muslim and Christian.37 But there is no mention in the objective country conditions evidence of violence against Christians occurring in Port Harcourt, or that religious militant groups operate there.\n[29] To sum up, there is a lack of objective evidence that the corruption in the police would support an inference that it would extend to the banking and mobile phone sectors to create a risk of locating the Appellant in Port Harcourt. Given the objective evidence that religious conflict is limited to the north and north-central regions of Nigeria, there is a dearth of objective evidence that supports the Appellant's subjective fear of a serious possibility of persecution in Port Harcourt. Therefore, I do not find a serious possibility of persecution or a risk to life or to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Port Harcourt, despite the Appellant having a subjective fear that the police in the Nigerian airports could grab him in Port Harcourt and in other Nigerian locations, and would disclose his location to the agents of persecution.38\nSecond prong: Is it objectively reasonable for the Appellant to seek refuge in Port Harcourt?\n[30] An independent review of the evidence reveals that it would not be unduly harsh to expect the Appellant to move to Port Harcourt. There is insufficient evidence of undue hardship in Port Harcourt which would jeopardize the Appellant's life or safety. The objective evidence does not meet the high threshold of the existence of conditions in Port Harcourt which would jeopardize the Appellant's life and safety.\n[31] The Appellant has a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The Appellant lived in Port Harcourt in 2005 and 2006 when he served in the XXXX XXXX XXXX.39 During his career in Nigeria, he worked in the XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. He also worked as a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX prior to leaving Nigeria.40 He testified that it would be difficult for him to get a job as an experienced hire due to an ethnic bias against him as a non-indigene person, and he has been out of the country for some time. He testified that he obtained his position at the XXXX through his brother's reference, and he now lacks a network because his friends have left Lagos. He also testified that out of the many members of his family, only his brother and himself were employed in Nigeria.41\n[32] According to the objective evidence, Port Harcourt, with a population of 3 million, is a city that attracts people from all over the country, especially from the North. The Appellant is from the south-west of Nigeria.42 The treatment of Christians who relocate to Port Harcourt depends on the ethnic group of the person, as language and culture is more important than religion.43 I am not persuaded by the Appellant's argument that his lack of ability in Pidgin English, which is the common language in Port Harcourt, will cause undue hardship. Since the Appellant speaks English and Yoruba, I find that any language difficulties that the Appellant will encounter in Port Harcourt is a hardship related to relocation. Such language differences will not amount to undue hardship that will jeopardize his life or safety. Moreover, the gap in his language abilities is mitigated by the fact that there are more than 200 languages are spoken in Port Harcourt.\n[33] Port Harcourt has a very high cost of living which makes life more difficult. It is almost impossible to find work in Port Harcourt unless one is a skilled worker or has a special talent such as a mechanic.44 The Appellant testified to an ethnic bias in hiring in Port Harcourt,45 which is supported by the objective evidence. In the formal sector, approximately 10 percent of state government jobs are reserved for the non-indigene population unless a skilled worker is sought. However, in the private sector, international oil companies select employees based on merit, skill, and necessity. Apart from employment in the government and the oil industry, people from the north can find work by trading or taxi driving in the informal sector.\n[34] The cost of renting or owning a home is very high in Rivers State. The internal movement of people into urban areas has caused a housing and infrastructure shortage in Nigeria. People must pay for healthcare and education in Rivers State.\n[35] The effect of the foregoing hardship factors, such as expensive housing, an inability to find suitable work, or an absence of relatives do not constitute undue hardship to render an IFA location unreasonable unless the Appellant's life or safety would be jeopardized.46 The hardship associated with relocation does not render an IFA unreasonable.47 The foregoing country conditions related to bias in hiring for government positions, Pidgin English being the common language, and the high cost of housing does not rise to the level of undue hardship that would jeopardize the Appellant's life and safety in Port Harcourt.\n[36] To sum up, I am not persuaded by the Appellant's argument that his ability in English and not Pidgin English will create undue hardship, as difficulties related to relocating to Port Harcourt will not jeopardize his life and safety. The Appellant held a variety of roles in XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX, which give him transferrable skills to employers in Port Harcourt in both the private sector which generally does not hire based on ethnic bias, and in the government sector which reserves a percentage of positions for non-indigenes and skilled people. The Appellant's transferrable skills mitigate the barriers which would otherwise be higher for non-skilled workers from outside Port Harcourt to find employment. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to find that the language barriers and the challenges to find suitable employment due to the relocation to Port Harcourt will jeopardize the Appellant's life and safety.\nCONCLUSION\n[37] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nT.

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX (Principal Appellant), citizen of Nigeria, and her son, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (Minor Appellant), citizen of the United States, are appealing the negative decision rendered in their case by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) on December 16, 2019.\n[2] The determinative issue for the RPD with respect to the Principal Appellant was credibility and prospective risk. The RPD had found that, although she was credible that she had been sexually assaulted by her uncle over a long period of time and currently suffers from XXXX, that she was not credible in her allegations that she had been in a forced marriage, was targeted by her husband or that she had been targeted for female genital mutilation (FGM). The determinative issue for the RPD with respect to the Minor Appellant was prospective risk, as there were no allegations put forth about forward-facing harm if he were to return to the United States.\n[3] The Appellants argue that the RPD erred in its credibility analysis by placing too much emphasis on omissions or inconsistencies in the port-of-entry forms and failed to properly apply Guideline 4, and that it erred in finding an absence of prospective risk because of the continued interest of the Principal Appellant's intended husband to locate her. The Appellants do not contest the RPD's findings regarding the Minor Appellant.\n[4] I find that the RPD erred in its findings regarding the Principal Appellant's credibility and forward-facing harm in Nigeria.\n[5] I find that the RPD did not err in its findings regarding the Minor Appellant.\n[6] I find that the Principal Appellant has produced credible evidence that she faces a serious possibility of persecution in Nigeria, as the member of a particular social group, namely women who fear gender-based violence. The Principal Appellant has rebutted the presumption of adequate state protection in Nigeria and I find that she faces a serious possibility of persecution throughout Nigeria, as there is no viable Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) there for her.\nDECISION\n[7] The appeal is allowed for the Principal Appellant. I substitute my own decision that the Principal Appellant is a Convention refugee in accordance with section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\n[8] The appeal is dismissed for the Minor Appellant. The RPD decision, that he is neither a Convention refugee under section 96, nor a person in need of protection under section 97 (1) of IRPA, is maintained.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[9] The Appellants requested the admission of two documents: (1) An affidavit by the Principal Appellant and (2) Photographs of the Principal Appellant and her intended husband at a celebration of their engagement.\n[10] I will assess the admissibility of the new evidence under subsection 110(4) of IRPA1, which states that appellants may only present evidence that arose after the rejection of their claim, or that was not reasonably available, or that they could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented at the time of the rejection. If the evidence meets one of the requirements of subsection 110(4), I will then continue my analysis using the factors outlined by the Federal Court of Appeal in Singh,2 which are credibility, relevance and newness.\n[11] The Appellants submit that the photographs produced were unavailable prior to the rejection of the claim, and the Affidavit explains the circumstances that made the photographs originally unavailable and the steps taken to acquire them.\nAffidavit by the Principal Appellant\n[12] In considering the Affidavit by the Principal Appellant, dated April 8, 2020, I note that there are statements in the Affidavit that explain the reasons behind her inability to have obtained the photographs, in paragraphs 2-16. There are also statements that revisit issues that were raised during the RPD hearing wherein the Principal Appellant was given the opportunity to address inconsistencies or omissions between her testimony and written evidence, in paragraphs 17-22.\n[13] The statements in the Affidavit that deal with the inability of the Principal Appellant to obtain photographic evidence of her relationship with the agent of persecution prior to the RPD decision and the subsequent steps she took to finally obtain them, are considered part of the Principal Appellant's submissions regarding how the new evidence meets the requirements of 110(4) IRPA.\n[14] However, the statements in the Affidavit that address matters that were already raised during the hearing regarding inconsistencies between the Principal Appellant's testimony and written evidence, including the terminology used to refer to her intended husband, her characterization of her marital status and her address prior to leaving Nigeria, do not meet any of the requirements of 110(4) of IRPA. These statements pertain to information that did not arise after the rejection of the claim, were reasonably available to her and could reasonably have been expected to have been presented at the time of rejection. I find this because they provide explanations that are either more in depth or add some additional information that could have been indicated during the hearing. I therefore find that paragraphs 17-22 of the Affidavit are not admissible.\nPhotographs\n[15] In assessing the admissibility of the photographs of the Principal Appellant's forced engagement to the agent of persecution under s 110(4) IRPA, I find that they meet one of the requirements, as they could not reasonably have been expected to have been presented at the time of rejection. I make this finding as a result of the explanation provided in the admissible portion of the Affidavit, Exhibit A-1, paragraphs 2-16, in which the Principal Appellant explains that she had tried without success to obtain copies of these pictures prior to her RPD hearing but had been unable to do so, which I find to be satisfactory.\n[16] In considering these photographs under the Singh criteria, I find the following: they appear credible, based on their source and the circumstances under which they came into existence as explained by the Principal Appellant in her submissions; they are relevant, as they help to establish the existence of one of the agents of persecution and the circumstances that are central to the Principal Appellant's allegations of a forced marriage; and they are new, as they are capable of contradicting a finding of fact made by the RPD, namely that the Principal Appellant had not established the existence of her intended husband, one of the agents of persecution, or that she had been forced into a relationship with him. I therefore find that they are admissible en liasse as Exhibit A-1.\nOral Hearing\n[17] Under section 110(6) of IRPA, an oral hearing will be held if the new evidence raises a serious credibility issue, is central to the claim and, if accepted, could justify allowing or rejecting the appeal.\n[18] I find that the new evidence does raise a serious credibility issue and is central to the claim; however, I do not feel that on its own, if accepted, it could justify allowing or rejecting the appeal. Even though the new evidence would help to corroborate some of the core allegations of the claim, it does not establish all the elements that would be required to dispose of the appeal, such as state protection or IFA.\n[19] I will therefore not hold an oral hearing based on this evidence.\nROLE OF THE RAD\n[20] When reviewing the RPD decision, I independently assessed the evidence, including listening to the recording and reading the transcript of the RPD hearing of November 8, 2019, to determine whether or not the RPD was correct in relation to each alleged error of law, of fact, or of mixed law and fact.\nNexus to the Convention\n[21] As the allegations of the Principal Appellant gives rise to the serious possibility of persecution based on her membership in a particular social group, women who fear gender-based violence, there is a nexus to the Convention. I shall therefore examine the allegations in light of section 96 of the IRPA.\n[22] The Principal Appellant's allegations will also be examined in accordance with Guideline 4, regarding women who fear gender-based persecution.\nRPD's Determinative issues regarding the Principal Appellant: Credibility and prospective harm\n[23] The RPD found that the Principal Appellant was not credible in her core allegations that she had been forced into a relationship with her intended husband, that she had lived with him for 11 years in an abusive relationship, or that she would face prospective harm if she were to return to Nigeria. The RPD did find the Principal Appellant credible in her allegations that she had been physically and sexually abused by her uncle throughout her adolescence and that she suffers from XXXX.\n[24] The Appellants argue that the RPD erred in its credibility analysis by placing excessive emphasis on the Principal Appellant's immigration forms and had misapplied Guideline 4 in the way it considered her credible allegations of past abuse and her credible diagnosis of XXXX in light of the inconsistencies and omissions in the forms.\nPrincipal Appellant's use of terminology regarding intended husband and her marital status\n[25] The RPD found that the Principal Appellant's credibility was undermined because she had identified herself as \"single\" in her immigration form, had omitted her intended husband from her list of family members in her BOC and had used different terms to refer to her intended husband in her BOC narrative and in her testimony during the hearing.\n[26] The Appellants argue that the Principal Appellant was consistent in the way she identified herself as \"single\" in her form, because legally she had been single as she was never formally married, but had only been intended to be married. Furthermore, throughout the hearing, she could be heard testifying that her family had referred to him as her husband, but she would refer to him as her \"supposed fianc\u00e9\" or \"forced husband\".\n[27] After reviewing the recording of the hearing and the documentary evidence, I find that the RPD erred in impugning the Principal Appellant's credibility on this issue. I find that she was consistent in her explanations and testimony, that it makes sense that she would have referred to herself as single, since she was single under the law; it makes sense that she did not include her intended husband in her list of family members in her BOC, as he was not her spouse nor a blood relative; and she repeatedly explained that her family members referred to the man as her husband, which is why in her narrative she called him that for simplicity, but that in reality and in her mind, he was not her husband, only a man that her family was forcing her to live with and trying to force her to marry. I find that the Principal Appellant provided satisfactory explanations to explain her unusual situation, in a clear and consistent manner that did not impugn her credibility.\nPrincipal Appellant's address while living with intended husband\n[28] The RPD found that the credibility of the Principal Appellant was negatively impacted by the omission of the address where she had lived with her intended husband for 11 years from her immigration form. When asked during the hearing to explain why she had omitted this address, she explained that at the time she had filled out the form, she had just completed a 3-day bus trip with her young son, and was exhausted and under stress, which she believed had caused her to omit the address. The RPD considered that even though she was under a lot of stress at the time she had filled out the forms and despite her credible diagnosis of XXXX that impacts memory, it was not reasonable for her to have forgotten to put this address on the form.\n[29] The Appellants argue that the Principal Appellant became emotional at the beginning of the hearing and expressed a reluctance to provide the address where she had lived with her intended husband, and said that the address brought back memories for her that she would have rather not experienced. She also answered four times that it was because she was stressed and tired after a 3-day bus journey with her 1-year-old son and that, especially in light of her XXXX diagnosis, it was not unreasonable for her to have omitted this address from her forms. The Appellants also argue that the RPD did not properly apply Guideline 4 because it failed to recognized memory distortion as a result of the abuse that she had suffered both from her uncle and her intended husband.\n[30] I find that the RPD erred in its negative credibility finding regarding this issue. The RPD found that the Principal Appellant was credible in her testimony that she had been under a great deal of stress after a 3-day bus journey with her young son, and found it credible that she was diagnosed with XXXX. I consider that those elements, considered credible by the RPD, which I also find credible after reviewing the evidence, in conjunction with her repeated testimony during the hearing during which she consistently explains her reason for having omitted this address, as well as her spontaneous ability to provide the address in a detailed, although reluctant fashion, leads me to believe that she was credible and had not provided it due to trauma and\/or stress that had been established on the balance of probabilities.\nPrincipal Appellant's failure to claim asylum in the U.S.\n[31] The RPD found that the Principal Appellant's credibility was mitigated by her failure to claim asylum in the U.S., despite having lived there for three years. It found that her explanation of the lawyer being too expensive was not reasonable, as the Principal Appellant was an educated woman who could have either represented herself or made more efforts to find an affordable lawyer.\n[32] The Appellants argue that the RPD erred in this finding because the Principal Appellant was in the U.S. with visitor status and therefore ineligible to work legally, which would have made it very difficult to earn the money required to pay a lawyer.\n[33] When I reviewed the evidence, I find that the RPD erred. First of all, the Principal Appellant's educational background consists of a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and her work experience is as an XXXX XXXX XXXX for the state government. Despite her fluency in English, I fail to see how that would have qualified her to self-represent before a refugee tribunal in the U.S. and I do not think that her credibility should be impugned based on her failure to do so, even if it was an option available to her. Second, the Principal Appellant was not allowed to work legally and tried to earn some money by doing XXXX, but I find it satisfactory that she was not able to earn enough to pay the legal fees that were quoted to her by an immigration lawyer, which was a logical step that she had taken to try to inform herself about regularizing her status there. Third, she had been discouraged by legal counsel in the U.S. from claiming asylum there, due to the political atmosphere at the time. I find the Principal Appellant's explanations satisfactory and conclude that the credibility of the Principal Appellant is not impugned for her failure to claim asylum in the U.S.\nEvidence in RPD record that was not weighed in the decision\n[34] I find that the RPD erred in stating that the Principal Appellant had not provided any evidence of her alleged 11-year relationship with her intended husband and that she had invented this relationship for the purpose of her refugee claim. I find that the Principal Appellant did provide evidence of this relationship, as well as of her prospective risk, through her written and oral testimony, her exhibits and in the objective documentary evidence. The RPD particularly erred in not giving weight to the following evidence, which I find outweighed any concerns that were highlighted by the RPD:\nBOC Narrative\n[35] In her amended BOC narrative, the Principal Appellant writes of the forced relationship with her intended husband. Specifically, in paragraph 3 of her narrative, she writes that in January 2002, her uncle told her that she had been promised to one of his friends, who she names and indicates that she had never met. She also indicates in this paragraph that she was expected to undergo FGM as a requirement of getting married, to which she was opposed. The Principal Appellant explains in this paragraph that her uncle was paying for her to attend university and that even though she was against the forced marriage, she could not say no.\n[36] In paragraph 4 of her narrative, she writes that she was forcibly taken to his house in August 2004 and that he had beaten and raped her. She had gone to the police in September 2004 to report the domestic violence but was told by police that this was a domestic matter and that they would not interfere. A month into the relationship, in this paragraph she writes that her intended husband had demanded that she undergo FGM and she refused, that they lived together for 11 years before she escaped while in the hospital.\n[37] In paragraph 5 of her narrative, she writes that his father is a XXXX XXXX XXXX, so she did not believe that she could safely relocate in Nigeria, as he had bragged to her in 2013 that there is nowhere she could run that the father could not declare her a wanted criminal and ensure that she would be found.\n[38] In paragraph 6 of her narrative, she writes that her intended husband with whom she lived would beat and sexually assault her, had threatened to pour acid on her and that she had also been threatened by her uncle with death if she were to continue to refuse to undergo FGM.\n[39] In paragraph 7 of her narrative, she found out that there had been a plot to kidnap her and force her to undergo FGM, that she had been chased by men in a car and she broke her arm in trying to escape.\n[40] In paragraph 8 of her narrative, she writes that she used the time when she was in the hospital as an opportunity to escape, since she had a valid visa for the U.S. and she had just escaped some men who were chasing her in an attempt to force her to undergo FGM. She also writes that she had done odd jobs to try to earn enough money to pay for a lawyer in the U.S. but that she had been unable to do so within the time required.\n[41] While the RPD found that the Principal Appellant was not credible overall in her allegations of the forced relationship with her intended husband, or in her reason for not claiming asylum in the U.S., it did not specifically assess any of these particular written allegations in her narrative or give them any weight and I consider that to be an error. I find that the level of detail provided in the narrative outweighs any problems raised by the RPD with respect to her immigration forms or the questions in the BOC, which I find she had satisfactorily addressed.\nTestimony\n[42] In her testimony, the Principal Appellant provided evidence of the forced relationship, including the circumstances in which she was told about him, when she met him, where he lives, his job, his connection to her uncles, his father's work as a XXXX XXXX XXXX, the political connections of her uncles, why her uncles and intended husband would still be looking for her if she were to return to Nigeria, how they continued to threaten her mother after she left Nigeria, why she would be in danger if she were to try to relocate within Nigeria, and the abuse she suffered at the hands of her intended husband during the time she lived with him, his intention to force her to undergo FGM, as well as the stigmatization and lack of access to care for those who require mental health care.\n[43] This testimony was not addressed by the RPD, although the global allegations were found not to be credible, and when listening to the recording of this testimony during the hearing, I find it to be spontaneous and detailed, as well as internally consistent. I find that her testimony is credible and should outweigh any concerns as earlier discussed by the RPD, with respect to establishing her core allegations of being in a forced relationship with an abusive man, who continues to look for her and has connections to people that have the means and motivation to track her down.\nExhibits provided to RPD but not considered in decision\n[44] Documents 5 and 6, a handwritten note and an affidavit from the Principal Appellant's friend, provide evidence of the core relationship.\n[45] The handwritten note by the Principal Appellant appears to be a brief summary of the circumstances that led her to obtain an affidavit from her friend, who had stated that she had run into the intended husband after the Principal Appellant had left Nigeria.\n[46] The affidavit by the Principal Appellant's friend describes an incident wherein she had met the intended husband, after the Principal Appellant had left Nigeria, and that he had threatened her. She also described having been friends with the Principal Appellant for 15 years and having seen her forced into a relationship with the intended husband.\n[47] Neither of these exhibits were addressed in the decision or found to be not credible. I reviewed them and consider them to be authentic and of high probative value for the purpose of establishing the forced relationship and the continued interest of the intended husband to locate the Principal Appellant.\nObjective documentary evidence\n[48] Country conditions in Nigeria are such that the allegations of the Principal Appellant are corroborated in the treatment of women, with respect to forced marriages, FGM and domestic violence.\n[49] Specifically, the objective documentary evidence indicates that there is a prevalence of forced marriages, particularly in the Muslim and Yoruba cultures-the Principal Appellant is Yoruba (tab 5.7 of National Documentation Package (NDP)); FGM is still practised despite being illegal in certain areas, and state authorities appear reluctant to interfere with traditional practices (tabs 5.2, 5.12, 5.21, 5.22, 5.28, 5.36, 10.8 of NDP); domestic violence is commonly accepted and police are reluctant to interfere (tabs 5.1, 5.3 of NDP); and the difficulties faced by single women who head their own households (tabs 5.9, 5.29 of NDP), all of which underscore the prospective harm that the Principal Appellant would face based on her credible allegations.\nNew Evidence\n[50] I find that even without the new evidence, the Principal Appellant's testimony and documentary evidence establish the existence of her forced relationship and abuse by the intended husband, on the balance of probabilities.\n[51] The submissions regarding the new evidence indicate that the Principal Appellant obtained the copies of the photographs, Exhibit A-1, from Nigeria through repeated efforts and I find that they appear to be authentic, depict the Principal Appellant at an engagement celebration with the agent of persecution and are highly relevant for the purpose of establishing the forced relationship with her intended husband. I therefore find that the new evidence has high probative value in establishing the core allegations of the appeal.\nConclusion regarding credibility and prospective harm\n[52] After reviewing all the testimonial, personal and documentary evidence, I find the Principal Appellant credible. I find that she has established, on the balance of probabilities, that she was forced into a relationship with a man against her will that her family wants her to marry; that she lived with this man against her will for 11 years; that she was abused physically and sexually by this man; that this man intends to subject her to FGM so that she can meet his requirements as a bride; that this man is the son of a XXXX XXXX XXXX who had the resources and connections to track her down throughout Nigeria; that this man is a friend of the uncles of the Principal Appellant, who themselves are well-connected and would have the means and motivation to help him track her down; that one of the uncles of the Principal Appellant, with whom she lived from the age of 11 until she was forced to move in with the intended husband, sexually abused her throughout her adolescence; and that she suffers from XXXX. I find that the Principal Appellant has therefore established that she faces the serious possibility of persecution in Nigeria based on the Convention ground of membership in a particular social group, women who fear gender-based violence; the Principal Appellant has established that she is subjectively fearful of forward-facing harm and that her fear is objectively well-founded.\nState protection\n[53] I find that the Principal Appellant has provided clear and convincing evidence that rebuts the presumption of state protection in Nigeria. I find that if she were to return to Nigeria, the authorities of the state would be either unwilling or unable to provide her with adequate state protection.\n[54] I based my findings on the oral and written testimony of the Appellants, specifically the Principal Appellant's credible allegations that she had gone to the police for help but they told her that they don't interfere in domestic matters. Also, she provided credible evidence that the intended husband is the son of a XXXX XXXX XXXX and friends with her uncles, all of whom have financial resources and political connections that would allow them, in conjunction with the propensity for corruption of authorities in Nigeria, to deny her protection.\n[55] Furthermore, the allegations are corroborated extensively by the NDP that documents widespread police corruption, a lack of training and resources3, and in particular the lack of state protection for women who are in forced relationships, women who have been the victims of sexual violence and domestic abuse and those who have been targeted for FGM.\nIFA\n[56] I find that the Principal Appellant does not have a viable IFA in Nigeria and that there is nowhere in Nigeria that would be safe and reasonable for her to relocate, as she would face the serious possibility of persecution throughout Nigeria.\n[57] Specifically, the Principal Appellant has provided evidence that the agents of persecution would have the means and motivation to find and harm her throughout Nigeria. Her intended husband is the son of a XXXX XXXX XXXX and the friend of her uncles, who are politically connected and would have the means and motivation to help him find her, if she were to try to relocate in Nigeria.\n[58] The Principal Appellant provided credible testimony and documentary evidence that the uncles are motivated by a concern for the family image, and that her refusal to marry the intended husband reflects poorly on the family, which is why they would assist the intended husband in finding her.\n[59] I therefore find that the agents of persecution have both the interest and ability to find and harm the Principal Appellant throughout Nigeria, such that she faces the serious possibility of persecution there and that there is no viable IFA.\nClaim of the Minor Appellant\n[60] The RPD found that the Minor Appellant did not establish a prospective risk in his country of nationality, the U.S.\n[61] The Appellants did not contest this finding.\n[62] After reviewing the evidence, I find that the RPD is correct and did not err in this finding.\nDETERMINATION\n[63] The appeal is allowed for the Principal Appellant and the RPD decision is set aside.\n[64] I substitute my own decision that the Principal Appellant is a Convention refugee in accordance with section 96 of IRPA.\n[65] The appeal is dismissed for the Minor Appellant and the RPD decision is maintained, that the Minor Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nReisa Khalifa\nMe Reisa Khalifa\nApril 15, 2021\nDate\nRK\/in\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD File \/ Dossier de la SAR : MC0-01794\nMC0-01795\nRAD.25.02 (January, 2020)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n2\nImmigration and Refugee\nBoard of Canada\nRefugee Appeal Division\nCommission de l'immigration\net du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 du Canada\nSection d'appel des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s\nRAD.25.02 (January, 2020)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] XXXX XXXX (Principal Appellant) and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (Minor Appellants), appeal a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD), dated January 31, 2019, rejecting their claims for refugee protection. All of the Appellants are citizens of Nigeria, and the Minor Appellant XXXX is also a citizen of South Africa.\n[2] The Principal Appellant alleges that she is at risk in Nigeria due to her identity as a bisexual woman. She further alleges that her sexual orientation has been discovered by her husband's family, which led them to beat her badly and threaten her and her children with cleansing rituals involving female genital mutilation (FGM) for the female Appellants, and a cutting ritual for the minor male Appellant.\n[3] It is alleged that as a result, the Appellants decided to flee Nigeria. They left XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX with a smuggler. They made inland refugee claims on February 6, 2017. Their claims were heard before the RPD on May 17, 2017 and June 26, 2017.\n[4] The RPD panel that heard the claim was not able to participate in the hearing of the claim to its conclusion. The Appellants consented to the claim being determined by a differently constituted panel, on the basis of the record. The RPD considered the record and dismissed the claims of the Principal Appellant and Minor Appellants XXXX XXXX XXXX on January 31, 2019 on the basis of credibility, finding that the Principal Appellant had not credibly established either her sexual orientation as a bisexual woman or the allegations that she and the Minor Appellants were at risk from her husband's family.\n[5] The Minor Appellant XXXX is a citizen of South Africa. No claim for refugee protection was made in respect of risk in South Africa, therefore her claim was rejected.\nDECISION\n[6] The appeal is allowed as it relates to the Principal Appellant. I find that the RPD erred in concluding that the Principal Appellant failed to credibly establish her bisexual identity. As such, I substitute the RPD's decision with respect to the Principal Appellant and find that the Principal Appellant is a Convention Refugee.\n[7] The appeal is denied as it relates to the Minor Appellants XXXX XXXX XXXX. The RPD correctly concluded that these Appellants did not credibly establish that they are at risk of FGM or ritual cleansing practices from the Principal Appellant's in-laws. This is the only risk alleged for these Appellants.\n[8] The appeal is denied as it relates to the Minor Appellant XXXX. The RPD correctly concluded that she does not face a serious possibility of persecution or s.97 harm in South Africa, where she is a citizen.\nROLE OF THE RAD\n[9] The jurisprudence of the Federal Court of Appeal in Huruglica1 establishes that the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) is empowered to conduct a hybrid appeal of RPD decisions. This means that the RAD must conduct its own independent analysis of the RPD's decision and determine whether or not the RPD erred. The standard of review of the RPD's findings is correctness, except in limited circumstances in which it is demonstrated that the RPD enjoyed a meaningful advantage in assessing oral evidence.\n[10] I have reviewed the transcript and evidence in the RPD record and I find that the RPD did not have a meaningful advantage over the RAD in assessing the evidence before it with respect to the Appellants' claims. This is particularly so because the RPD panel that made the decision was not the same panel that conducted the hearings. I have therefore applied a correctness standard in my review.\nRPD DECISION AND GROUNDS FOR APPEAL\n[11] To sum up broadly, the RPD considered the record and found that the Principal Appellant was not credible overall, and then found that the corroborative evidence was insufficient to overcome her lack of credibility. It concluded that she is not bisexual on a balance of probabilities and therefore, the allegations of risk to all of the Appellants due to the Principal Appellant's alleged bisexuality are also not credible.\n[12] More specifically, the RPD found that the Principal Appellant's testimony about the history and development of her sexual identity was not credible, and concluded that the she had failed to credibly establish that she is bisexual, or that she was a victim of sexual abuse or had entered into any consensual same-sex relationships as alleged. The panel considered the corroborative evidence of her bisexuality including supporting letters, photographs of the Principal Appellant with various alleged same-sex partners, and evidence of her alleged same-sex relationship in Canada and involvement with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) support organizations in Canada, but gave it no weight.\n[13] The RPD also found numerous credibility problems with the allegations of the events that purportedly caused the Appellants to flee. The panel found that the Principal Appellant's allegation that her mother-in-law had seen the Principal Appellant kissing a woman on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was not credibly explained during the hearing. It did not believe the allegations that the Minor Appellant XXXX had been scalded that same day, or that the Principal Appellant was beaten by the in-laws a few days later, noting that the corroborative evidence was not consistent with the Principal Appellant's testimony. Further, the panel gave no weight to the supporting letter from the Principal Appellant's husband XXXX, noting that it only briefly reiterated the allegations at the core of the claim.\n[14] The RPD drew a further adverse inference against the Principal Appellant's general credibility due to her explanation for the failure to produce the original passports, which it found not to be credible. Additionally, it drew an adverse inference on the basis of the Principal Appellant's reavailment to Nigeria on numerous occasions after travelling XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, finding that it would be reasonable to expect that she would have sought asylum at an earlier opportunity rather than return to Nigeria where she alleged to face ongoing risk due to her sexual identity.\n[15] On appeal, the Appellants argue that the RPD erred in its assessment of the Principal Appellant's credibility and failed to properly apply Chairperson's Guideline 92 when it made credibility findings regarding her testimony about her sexual orientation. They submit that the RPD also erred by failing to give the appropriate weight to the sworn testimony at the hearing.\n[16] The Appellants further submit that the RPD's findings related to the alleged scalding and beating incidents were based on minor, peripheral inconsistencies that amount to a microscopic examination of the evidence, and that the RPD erred in giving no weight to the corroborative evidence presented in support of the claims.\n[17] Finally, the Appellants argue that the RPD erred in drawing an adverse inference against the Principal Appellant based on her failure to claim asylum during XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, arguing that it is reasonable that she did not claim prior to the alleged incident in XXXX XXXX when her sexual identity was purportedly revealed, which was the triggering event that put the Appellants at risk of harm from the in-laws and caused them to flee.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[18] On appeal, the Appellant has submitted the following new evidence:\na. Letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX dated December 14, 2018;3\nb. Letter from the XXXX XXXX XXXX dated March 18, 2019;4\nc. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX attendance sheet;5 and\nd. XXXX Attendance Sheet.6\n[19] The admissibility of new evidence before the RAD is governed by s.110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the Act). The Appellants must establish that the evidence arose after the rejection of their claim, was not reasonably available at the time of rejection, or that they could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented it at the time of rejection.\n[20] If the evidence meets the test outlined in s.110(4), then I must also consider whether it is credible, relevant and new as outlined by the Federal Court of Appeal in the Singh7 and Raza8 cases. For the following reasons, I am not admitting the letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, however I am admitting the letter from the XXXX XXXX XXXX and the attendance sheets from XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[21] The letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is dated December 14, 2018 and speaks to the medical conditions of the Principal Appellant at the time of writing. The Appellants' claim was denied by the RPD on January 31, 2019. The Appellants have not provided an explanation as to why this evidence was not reasonably available at the time of rejection or why they could not have reasonably been expected to present it to the RPD. It is therefore not accepted as new evidence for the appeal.\n[22] The remaining pieces of new evidence relate to the Principal Appellant's attendance at the XXXX XXXX XXXX, which are organizations devoted to providing support to LGBTQ persons in Canada. I find that they are admissible pursuant to s.110(4) because they are evidence of activities that took place after the refugee claim was determined. Turning to the Singh\/Raza factors, I find that the documents are credible, in that there are no prima facie deficiencies. They are relevant because they seek to establish the Principal Appellant's identity as a bisexual woman. They are new in the sense that they relate to events that occurred after the Appellants' claims were dismissed. As such, I find that the XXXX letter, XXXX attendance sheets and XXXX attendance sheets meet the jurisprudential test for new evidence. These items are accepted as new evidence. I will address the weight to be given to this evidence in my analysis below.\n[23] Where new evidence is accepted by the RAD, an oral hearing may be held pursuant to s.110(6) of the Act, if the RAD is satisfied that the evidence raises a serious issue with respect to the credibility of the person who is the subject of the appeal, is central to the decision with respect to the refugee protection claim, and if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the claim.\n[24] I do not find that the new evidence that I have accepted satisfies any of the conditions outlined in s.110(6). The appeal will therefore proceed without an oral hearing.\nANALYSIS\nThe RPD erred in finding that the presumption of truthfulness of sworn testimony was displaced\n[25] Following my independent analysis of the record, I find that the RPD erred in its assessment of the credibility of the Principal Appellant. As discussed in more detail below, while there are some individual credibility findings that I will uphold, I find that the RPD erred in a number of its key credibility findings. When I consider the remaining adverse findings, I do not find that they sustain the RPD's finding that the presumption of truthfulness of sworn testimony was displaced. I therefore find that the Principal Appellant's testimony must be presumed to be truthful, except in specific areas where there is reason to doubt it, which I have analyzed below.\nThe RPD erred in finding that the Principal Appellant should have sought asylum during XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\n[26] The RPD noted that the Principal Appellant had travelled outside of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. She also travelled to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The panel found that given that the Principal Appellant alleged that she was at risk due to her sexual orientation throughout those periods, her decision to return XXXX XXXX rather than to seek asylum during any of these trips undermined the truthfulness of her claim that she is bisexual. The RPD did not accept the explanation that she only feared for her life once her sexual identity was discovered by her in-laws in XXXX XXXX.\n[27] The Appellants argue that the RPD erred in rejecting the Principal Appellant's explanation, and I agree. While a LGBTQ individual cannot be expected to hide their sexual orientation in order to live safely, their own decision to do so in their home country prior to fleeing cannot be held against them, particularly where the revelation of their sexual identity would likely lead to imminent harm.\n[28] While I do not find that the allegation that the Principal Appellant's sexual identity was discovered by her in-laws is credible for other reasons, as discussed below, the RPD's failure to accept this explanation for failing to claim during XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and the adverse credibility inference it made on this basis, are errors.\nThe RPD erred in its assessment of the Principal Appellant's testimony about the history and development of her sexual identity\n[29] The RPD made a factual finding in its decision that the Principal Appellant alleged to have become bisexual as a result of sexual abuse she alleged to have endured in college. The panel noted that the Principal Appellant did not allege any same sex attraction prior to the sexual abuse, and alleged to have become involved with her first consensual same-sex partner on the basis of their shared history of sexual abuse, rather than due to attraction. The RPD considered these factors and concluded that the Principal Appellant's testimony about the development of her sexual identity is not credible.\n[30] The Appellants argue that the RPD's determination is based on a faulty premise that the Principal Appellant alleged a causal connection between the sexual abuse and her sexual orientation. I agree. As the Appellants point out, the abuse was referenced as part of a chronological accounting of events, and the Principal Appellant did not at any point allege that the abuse caused her to become bisexual. I find that the RPD erred in drawing an adverse inference against the Principal Appellant on the basis of this factual error and also erred by seeking a reason to explain her sexual orientation, which is an innate characteristic.\n[31] The Principal Appellant was also asked by the RPD to describe how she first became involved in consensual same-sex relations. She testified that in XXXX, she was forced to engage in non-consensual sexual activity with an XXXX XXXX XXXX. After that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the Principal Appellant told her XXXX XXXX about the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX revealed that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The Principal Appellant and XXXX later became involved in a relationship and decided to engage in same-sex acts together9.\n[32] The RPD found that the Principal Appellant's testimony that she and a consensual partner later decided to try the same-sex acts that had been forced on them was not credible because it was fundamentally inconsistent with her testimony that these acts had been wrong and that she had been victimized. I find that the RPD erred here by finding that the aspect of the sexual abuse that was wrong was the same-sex acts themselves, rather than the lack of consent.\n[33] Setting aside the errors outlined above, I have reviewed and considered the testimony related to the Principal Appellant's identity as a bisexual woman, in consideration of the SOGIE Guidelines. I note that the Principal Appellant's testimony as it relates to her involvement in past same-sex relationships was credible and consistent over the course of two sittings, and consistent with her written narrative.\n[34] She further presented evidence of a same-sex relationship in Canada. While the RPD found it unreasonable that she did not have this person testify on her behalf at the hearing in May 2017, I find that her explanation that she did not ask because the relationship had only become sexual a week prior to the hearing, is reasonable.\n[35] The RPD further questioned why a letter was provided from this partner rather than an affidavit, and noted concerns about the timing and production of text messages between them. The Appellants argue that the RPD erred by rejecting the evidence provided, and that the RPD's analysis of the communication records was microscopic. Having considered the testimony and evidence, I find that the RPD erred in rejecting the testimony and supporting evidence with respect to the same-sex partner in Canada, which is credible and supports the allegation that she is bisexual. I find that the RPD's concerns were likely motivated by its negative determination of the Principal Appellant's overall credibility, which I have found not to be supportable.\n[36] Overall, I find that the Principal Appellant's testimony about her sexual identity is credible and is sufficient to establish that she is a bisexual woman, on a balance of probabilities. It is therefore unnecessary for me to undertake an in-depth assessment of the remaining supporting evidence that pertains to her identity as a bisexual woman, including the new evidence submitted before the RAD.\n[37] I will, however, address the matter of the photographs submitted, purporting to be of the Principal Appellant and former female partners. The RPD found that these photographs do not establish that the Principal Appellant was in same-sex relationships, only friendships, and therefore they do not prove the allegation that the Principal Appellant is bisexual. The Appellants argue on appeal that the RPD erred by expecting the Principal Appellant to produce explicit photographs to prove her sexual orientation.\n[38] I find that the Appellants' argument mischaracterizes the RPD's finding. It would be wrong to expect explicit photos, but the RPD did not do that. It had a duty to analyze the evidence before it, and when it considered the photos, it found that they were not probative evidence of the Principal Appellant's sexual orientation.\nThe Principal Appellant has established her sexual identity on a balance of probabilities\n[39] Having found that the Principal Appellant's sexual identity as a bisexual woman is established, and in considering the objective evidence that same-sex sexual activity is illegal across Nigeria under federal law, and carries a penalty of up to 14 years imprisonment10, I find that she would face a serious possibility of persecution if she returned to Nigeria, on a balance of probabilities. As the agent of persecution is the state, I further find that there is no possibility of state protection or of a safe internal flight alternative. I therefore find that the Principal Appellant is a Convention refugee.\nThe RPD correctly found that the in-laws have not discovered the Principal Appellant's sexual orientation as alleged\n[40] The RPD found that the allegations of events in December 2016 that purportedly caused the Appellants to flee were not credible. This included the allegations that:\n* the mother-in-law saw the Principal Appellant kissing a woman,\n* the mother-in-law entered the Appellants' home and tried to throw hot water on the Principal Appellant but missed her target and instead scalded the Minor Appellant XXXX with the hot water,\n* a few days later, the mother-in-law and other in-laws went to the Principal Appellant's mother's home and beat her severely, resulting in hospitalization, and\n* as a result, the in-laws threatened to have cleansing rituals imposed on all of the Appellants, composed of FGM for the female Appellants and cutting rituals for the minor male Appellant\n[41] For the reasons that follow, I conclude that the Appellants have failed to establish that these events took place, or that they are at risk in Nigeria at the hands of the in-laws due to the Principal Appellant's sexual orientation, on a balance of probabilities.\nThe RPD erred in its credibility finding about the discovery of the same-sex relationship, but it is not determinative\n[42] The RPD found that the Principal Appellant's testimony of how her mother-in-law caught her kissing another woman on December 24, 2016 lacked credibility, because she was unable to explain how the mother-in-law saw them through the window when the blinds were closed. The Appellants argue that the testimony is plausible and the RPD erred by rejecting it.\n[43] I agree with the Appellants. The Principal Appellant's testimony in this area was brief and straightforward. She testified that the window blind was drawn and her mother-in-law had seen them through it. Many blinds do not provide complete privacy. I find that the RPD erred in drawing an adverse inference on the basis of this testimony. However, in light of the issues identified below with respect to the allegations of scalding and beating incidents, I do not find that the events alleged on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX are established to have taken place, on a balance of probabilities.\nThe RPD correctly found that the allegation that the Principal Appellant was beaten by the in-laws is not established on a balance of probabilities\n[44] The RPD found that the allegation that the Principal Appellant was beaten at her mother's house on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX by her in-laws was not credible. The panel noted that the medical report incorrectly listed the Principal Appellant's XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and noted the Appellant's testimony that her former partner XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX11. The RPD further found that that the photograph presented did not depict the injuries described in the report, and that it was not credible that the Principal Appellant's sister would take such a photo of her if not for the purpose of buttressing a false claim.\n[45] The Appellants argue that the RPD erred by making a credibility finding on the basis of the error in the Principal Appellant's occupation listed in the medical report, which they submit is peripheral and not central to the claim. They further submit that the photograph was taken from a distance such that it is not possible to assess the extent of her injuries, and that it is not unreasonable that her sister would take a photo to document the incident.\n[46] Following my review of the record and the original photograph referenced above, I agree with the RPD's finding that the allegation that the Principal Appellant was beaten by her in-laws is not established on a balance of probabilities.\n[47] I find that the explanation provided by the Principal Appellant as to the discrepancy in the medical report, being that her mother advised the hospital that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX,12 is unreasonable. I find this is particularly so in light of the Principal Appellant's testimony that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and that her alleged former partner XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[48] As such, I find the explanation for the discrepancy in the medical report is not reasonably explained and I find that the lack of credibility of this sworn testimony undermines the credibility of the allegation overall. While the issue of the occupation of the Principal Appellant is not central to the claim, her unreasonable explanation for the discrepancy is highly relevant to the issue of the credibility of her testimony in this area.\n[49] Further, having obtained and reviewed the original photograph of the Principal Appellant's purported hospitalization, I agree with the RPD that it does not reflect the injuries described in the medical report. The report indicates that she presented with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\"13. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX14. The colour photograph of the Principal Appellant shows a clear view of the right side of her face, including her eye, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[50] I do not agree with the RPD's finding that it is not credible that the Principal Appellant's sister would take a photo of the Principal Appellant in the hospital. I agree with the Appellants' submission that it is reasonable that they would seek to document such an incident. However, I find that if these injuries did occur under the circumstances alleged, and that if the Principal Appellant and her family had an interest in documenting them as suggested by the Appellants, they would have taken photos that clearly depict the injuries.\n[51] I further note that in the analysis related to this finding, the RPD identified an inconsistency which I find to be significant. In testimony, the Principal Appellant said that after this alleged beating, her mother went to the police and attempted to report it, but they would not help her, and told her that people who get beaten have done something to deserve it15. The narrative and the supporting letter from the Principal Appellant's mother both fail to mention the attempt to seek assistance from the police. While the RPD identified this omission in its reasons, no argument was made about it on appeal. In my own independent analysis, I find that this is a significant omission that further undermines the credibility of the allegation that the Principal Appellant was assaulted by her in-laws in XXXX XXXX.\n[52] On the basis of the above, I find that the allegation that the Appellants were targeted by the in-laws is not established on a balance of probabilities.\nThe RPD correctly found that the allegation that the Minor Appellant was scalded by the in-laws is not established on a balance of probabilities\n[53] With respect to the alleged scalding of the Minor Appellant XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX the RPD noted that the narrative described XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\"16 while the photographs and medical report17 suggested that they were severe. It further noted that the medical report indicated that the Minor Appellant was accompanied to the hospital by the Principal Appellant and relatives, while the testimony at the hearing was that she went to the hospital with the Principal Appellant and neighbours. The RPD concluded that XXXX XXXX XXXX did not occur under the circumstances alleged.\n[54] The Appellants argue on appeal that the difference between \"slight\" and \"severe\" is subjective, and the description of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\" does not amount to a material inconsistency. They further submit that the inconsistency in the medical report could easily be the result of a mistaken assumption by the doctor who wrote the report. I do not find that the reference in the medical report to \"relatives\" is material and I find that the RPD erred in focusing on this minor inconsistency. However, I find that the RPD correctly found that the inconsistency between the \"XXXX XXXX XXXX described in the narrative and the photographic and medical evidence is significant. Having obtained and examined the original photographs, I do not agree that XXXX XXXX XXXX would be reasonably described as \"slight\".\n[55] I further note that the Appellants travelled to Canada a few weeks after this injury is alleged to have taken place, yet made no efforts to seek medical treatment or follow up in Canada. I find that the failure to seek such treatment in Canada further diminishes the credibility of the allegation.\n[56] Even accepting that the medical report is credible, it is not highly probative of the Appellants' allegations because it only establishes that the Minor Appellant XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX injury, and not how or by whom.\n[57] In light of the above concerns, I do not find that the Appellants have credibly established that the burn injury took place under the circumstances alleged.\nThe remaining corroborative evidence cannot overcome the credibility concerns\n[58] The Appellants submitted a number of supporting letters before the RPD, which seek to corroborate the allegations of risk at the hands of the in-laws. The RPD found that these letters generally reiterate the account in the narrative and gave them no weight in establishing the allegations at the core of the claim. The Appellants argue on appeal that the RPD erred in rejecting this evidence, which they submit are credible and consistent with the Appellants' testimony and evidence.\n[59] As I have already found that the Principal Appellant has established her identity as a bisexual woman on a balance of probabilities, I will focus on the supporting evidence only as it relates to the allegation that the Principal Appellant's sexual orientation was exposed by her in-laws who now seek to harm the Minor Appellants.\n[60] It is established in jurisprudence that submitting a false or irregular document can have an impact on the weight assigned to other documents provided. Concerns with the authenticity of documents submitted is grounds to more closely scrutinize other evidence submitted in support of the claim18. I will outline significant concerns with respect to the reliability of three important supporting letters below, which in turn causes me to doubt the reliability of all of the supporting letters submitted.\n[61] A letter was provided from XXXX19, who is alleged to have been involved XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX the Principal Appellant from XXXX XXXX XXXX. I agree with the RPD that the letter largely mirrors the Appellants' written narrative and note that it references the same minor details of events, some of which occurred XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, suggesting that the letter was written based on a review of the narrative rather than a spontaneous, independent account of the events that transpired. I further note that with respect to the allegations of harm at the hands of the in-laws, XXXX accounting is based completely on what she was told by the Principal Appellant and not on any independent or personal knowledge.\n[62] Further, the letter begins with \"I am a secret bisexual lady\" and goes on to describe numerous same-sex affairs and activities. The letter is notarized by a lawyer in Nigeria. The objective evidence indicates that due to the stigma and illegality of same-sex activity in Nigeria, it would be very unusual for a lawyer to notarize a statement where someone is admitting to same-sex activity or orientation, and that such activity would come at a high risk to the lawyer, who would be required by law to report the client to the authorities20 Also, for an LGBTQ person to swear such an affidavit would essentially amount to reporting him or herself to the law and exposing themselves to such consequences as violence, arrest, blackmail and extortion21. The objective evidence causes me to doubt whether the letter is credible and reliable, given its content.\n[63] Finally, I note that the voter identification card provided to prove that the document was in fact authored by XXXX contains an irregularity. While the objective evidence shows that the name on a voter identification card should be reflected as \"Surname, First Name, Other Names\", the card presented displays the name as \"First Name Middle Name Surname\"22. This discrepancy was not noted by the RPD and so it was raised to the Appellants as a new issue by the RAD, to provide an opportunity for submissions.\n[64] The Appellants submit that this is an administrative error on the part of the individual who entered the information on the card. I do not find that this is a reasonable or likely explanation. The objective evidence shows that these voter cards were processed through a sophisticated automated system and not manually typewritten. Even an inversion of the names in data entry would result in a card that would print in the same format of \"Surname, First Name\" with a comma between the names.\n[65] In consideration of the issues outlined above, I find that the letter from XXXX lacks credibility and I give it no weight in establishing the allegations that the Appellants are at risk of harm from the in-laws.\n[66] The Principal Appellant's mother also submitted a notarized support letter with an accompanying national identity card23. The identity card lists her city of residence as \"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. This discrepancy was not noted by the RPD and so it was raised to the Appellants as a new issue by the RAD, to provide an opportunity for submissions. The Appellants again submit that this is likely an administrative error on the part of the individual who entered the information on the card.\n[67] XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, is a major city in Nigeria with a population of 1.676 million24. The card was purportedly issued by the authorities in XXXX XXXX. I do not find it likely that an identification card would be issued by the authorities with a spelling error of this nature. I further note the objective evidence that documentation fraud is highly prevalent in Nigeria and particularly in XXXX XXXX25.\n[68] I further consider that the card has no signature, so I am unable to verify the signature on the signed document. As to the content of the letter, it indicates that in addition to the alleged threats of FGM and cleansing rituals, the in-laws \"want [the Principal Appellant] dead\". The Principal Appellant has alleged only that the in-laws have threatened her with FGM and cleansing rituals, not death.\n[69] In consideration of the above, I do not find that the letter is reliable evidence and I give it no weight in establishing the allegations of harm at the hands of the in-laws.\n[70] There was also a letter submitted from the person who purportedly assisted them to flee, XXXX XXXX26. The letter is accompanied by a copy of a document purporting to be his Nigerian Driver's License, XXXX XXXX XXXX. The RAD noted that the document did not appear to conform with the specimen card in the objective evidence27. This discrepancy was not noted by the RPD and so it was raised to the Appellants as a new issue by the RAD, to provide an opportunity for submissions.\n[71] The Appellants rely on evidence that was in the National Documentation Package (NDP) before the RPD28, which shows that the format of the driver's license presented conforms with an older version of the Nigerian Driver's License. They submit that while the evidence indicates that a new format was first issued in 2011, it also indicates that the timing of the changeover of licenses varied and different procedures were still in use in different provinces at the time of the report (March 2012).\n[72] I have reviewed the objective evidence and I note that while there was a period when both the old and new driver's licenses were being legitimately issued, the transition dates for all provinces to introduce the new version of the license were all in 2011 and 2012. It was also noted that all citizens with the former version of the driver's license would be required to upgrade to the new one at some point in 2012. On the basis of the evidence before me, I find that XXXX XXXX was not issued a genuine driver's license in the old format XXXX XXXX, on a balance of probabilities.\n[73] The presentation of a non-genuine identification document causes me to doubt the reliability of the letter attached to it. I give no weight to this letter in establishing the allegations of risk at the hands of the in-laws due to the Principal Appellant's sexual orientation.\n[74] Due to the significant concerns with these three letters, including the submission of non-genuine identification documents, I find that the credibility of all of the supporting letters is diminished. I also find that the letters have low probative value for the reasons below.\n[75] The Appellants have submitted a letter from the neighbour who purportedly accompanied them to the hospital on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX29. The letter is accompanied by a low-quality copy of a national identity card which again has no signature to compare. It is notarized by the same notary who notarized XXXX letter.\n[76] The letter outlines the purported scalding incident on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and further reports that the author was told by the Principal Appellant's husband that the in-laws are now seeking to harm the Appellants as a result. I find that this letter cannot overcome the concerns outlined earlier with respect to the allegation of the purported scalding incident, and I give little weight to it as it relates to the evidence of prospective future harm of the Appellants, which is not within his personal knowledge but only a repetition of what the author was purportedly told by XXXX.\n[77] The Appellants also submitted a letter from the Principal Appellant's spouse, XXXX XXXX which broadly outlines the allegations at the core of the claim30. The letter is fairly vague, considering that it is purported to be authored by a person with in-depth personal knowledge of the allegations at the core of the claim. Also, it indicates that the risk that the Minor Appellants are subject to is \"my family traditional ritual of blood oath and circumcision of my female children\" implying that this is simply a family tradition rather than a retaliation or consequence related to the alleged discovery of the Principal Appellant's sexual orientation. In light of these concerns, I give the letter little weight in establishing the allegations made by the Appellants.\n[78] In consideration of my findings above, I draw an adverse inference on the basis of the submission of fabricated documents to support the Appellants' claims, and I find that the corroborative evidence presented is not sufficient to overcome my concerns with the credibility of the allegation that the Appellants are at risk of harm in Nigeria at the hands of the in-laws.\nThe RPD correctly found that the Appellants' explanation for failing to produce their genuine passports was not credibly explained\n[79] The RPD also found that the Appellants' allegation that their passports had been stolen by their in-laws to prevent them from leaving Nigeria lacked credibility. It found that the Principal Appellant's explanation of follow-up efforts with the police and Nigerian officials was not credible and drew an adverse inference on her failure to present corroborative evidence of these efforts, concluding that this undermined the credibility of her allegation that she fled due to risk at the hands of her in-laws.\n[80] This finding was not disputed on appeal. I have reviewed the record and I agree with the RPD that the Principal Appellant's explanations are not credible, for the reasons it gave. I find that this further diminishes the credibility of the allegations of the circumstances of their departure from Nigeria and the prospective harm alleged from the in-laws.\n[81] In consideration of the factors discussed above, I conclude that the Appellants have not established that they are at risk at the hands of the in-laws due to their discovery of the Principal Appellant's sexual orientation.\nThe Minor Appellants have not established that they are at risk in Nigeria\n[82] The Minor Appellants XXXX XXXX XXXX are alleged to be at risk due to the sexual orientation of their mother, the Principal Appellant. This risk is alleged to exist as a result of the discovery of the Principal Appellant's sexual orientation by her husband's family. I have found that the Appellants have failed to establish the discovery of the Principal Appellant's sexual orientation is allegation on a balance of probabilities.\n[83] I have also reviewed the objective country conditions evidence with respect to the treatment of family members of bisexual persons in Nigeria. While there is some evidence that family members of sexual minorities may experience some stigma and discrimination, other sources indicate that these risks are considerably reduced or eliminated once the LGBTQ person is no longer in Nigeria31.\n[84] Given that the objective evidence in the NDP was updated after the RPD decision, the Appellants were given notice that the RAD would be considering the updated documentation and given an opportunity to make submissions about this evidence. The Appellants submitted that the updated evidence supports their alleged fears of being subjected to traditional cleansing rituals. I note however that the evidence specifically indicates that these practices are targeted at sexual minorities in attempts to \"heal\" them, because \"homosexuality is seen as an evil spirit which possesses the affected person\". It does not mention that children or relatives of sexual minorities could be subjected to these rituals as a result of their relationship to a LGBTQ parent or relative.\n[85] I find that there is insufficient evidence that the Minor Appellants would be subject to a serious possibility of persecution or to harm as described in s.97 of the Act due to their relationship to the Principal Appellant. There are no other risks alleged or apparent with respect to the Minor Appellants XXXX XXXX XXXX, therefore, this finding is determinative of their claims for protection.\nThe Minor Appellant XXXX claim for protection is rejected\n[86] No grounds for appeal were advanced with respect to the Minor Claimant XXXX. While she was included as a claimant and appellant with respect to the allegations of risk for all of the Appellants in Nigeria, it was conceded before the RPD that no claim for protection was being advanced with respect to South Africa, where she is also a citizen. I agree with the RPD's finding that the Minor Appellant XXXX is not a Convention refugee and I uphold that decision.\nCONCLUSION\n[87] The appeal is allowed as it relates to the Principal Appellant XXXX XXXX. Pursuant to section 111(1)(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the Act), the RAD sets aside the determination of the RPD and substitutes its own determination that the Principal Appellant is a Convention refugee.\n[88] The RAD dismisses the appeal as it relates to the Appellants XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and confirms the decision of the RPD that these Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection, pursuant to section 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the Act).\n(signed)\nCheryl Braden\nCheryl Braden\nJuly 30, 2020\nDate\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD File \/ Dossier de la SAR : TB9-05937\nTB9-05938 \/ TB9-05939 \/ TB9-05940\nRAD.25.02 (January, 2020)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n2\nImmigration and Refugee\nBoard of Canada\nRefugee Appeal Division\nCommission de l'immigration\net du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 du Canada\nSection d'appel des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s\nRAD.25.02 (January, 2020)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] The appeal is allowed.\n[2] The appellant, XXXX XXXX, is a citizen of Haiti. He is appealing the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejecting his refugee protection claim.\n[3] The appellant is a XXXX at an evangelical church. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, he XXXX XXXX XXXX in support of Bruno Joseph Firmin Jr., a LAPEH party candidate in the parliamentary election. He was involved in Firmin's campaign, but he was not a party member. The appellant alleges that on XXXX XXXX, 2016, he and his wife and children were kidnapped by criminals working for the V\u00e9rit\u00e9 party, which was running against Firmin. The appellant was beaten and left for dead. When he regained consciousness, he went home, packed his bags and, along with his wife and children, left Limb\u00e9, the city where he lived. The appellant states that he took refuge at the home of XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[4] On XXXX XXXX, 2016, the appellant left Haiti for the United States, where he claimed asylum. He abandoned his asylum claim to come to Canada in XXXX 2017, because he feared being deported to his country of origin.\n[5] The RPD rejected his refugee protection claim on the basis that the appellant's allegations were not corroborated by credible documentary evidence. The RPD's reasoning reads as follows:\n[Translation]\nThe panel gives more weight to the absence of documents from the two pastors-one is the claimant's Evangelical associate, the other was the claimant's host when he was in supposedly in distress following the alleged events-than it does to the two letters filed under D-6 and D-7; one is from a friend who no longer lives in Haiti, the other is short and vague.\n[6] The appellant alleges that the RPD erred in analyzing his credibility.\nSCOPE OF THE APPEAL\n[7] The RAD's role is not to carry out a de novo consideration of refugee protection claims, but to determine whether the RPD erred as alleged.1 I conducted an independent analysis of the record in order to reach my own conclusions.2 This included listening to the RPD hearing recording and reviewing the RPD's record and the appellant's record. I concluded that the correctness standard of review should be applied.3\nANALYSIS\n[8] With all due respect, I find that the RPD erred in its analysis of the appellant's credibility.\n[9] It is well established by the case law that a refugee protection claimant's allegations are presumed to be true unless there are reasons to doubt their truthfulness.4 However, there are two scenarios in which it is possible to require corroborative evidence. Corroboration may be required when a refugee protection claimant's credibility is in doubt-because of contradictions, omissions, or inconsistencies in the evidence-or when their behaviour is inconsistent with the alleged fear. Corroborative evidence may also be required when it should reasonably be available and there is no valid explanation for its absence.5\n[10] In this case, the RPD did not logically and clearly explain why it doubted the appellant's allegations and, consequently, why corroborative evidence was required.\nThe fact that he abandoned his refugee protection claim in the United States to file one in Canada does not significantly undermine the appellant's credibility\n[11] The appellant fled to the United States in XXXX 2016. He had a US visa, issued in 2015, that was valid for five years. Fearing the anti-immigrant rhetoric of the administration at that time, he abandoned his claim in the United States in order to file one in Canada. This behaviour might have been irrational, based on a misconception of US immigration law or simply misguided, but it is not inconsistent with the alleged fear. By coming to Canada to file a refugee protection claim, which, it bears noting, was eligible, the appellant did not compromise his status by increasing the likelihood of a return to Haiti. I am of the opinion that the appellant's behaviour does not undermine his credibility and, consequently, that it does not trigger a requirement for corroborative evidence.\nThe appellant submitted corroborative evidence; its weakness does not justify doubting his allegations\n[12] The appellant submitted a letter from a friend to corroborate his allegations. This friend readily states that it was the appellant who told her about his troubles. I agree with the RPD's conclusion that this evidence relies on hearsay and does not have much probative value.\n[13] The appellant also submitted a letter from the candidate, Firmin, confirming that the appellant was involved in his campaign and that he was attacked by [translation] \"criminal\" supporters of the rival party. This document could certainly be more detailed, but what it states confirms the appellant's allegations.\n[14] I have no choice but to note that the appellant, regardless of what one thinks of the robustness of the evidence he submitted, did submit corroborative evidence.\n[15] However, faced with this evidence, which it considered to be of little probative value because it is based on hearsay and lacks details about [translation] \"the date [and] location where the event allegedly occurred,\" the RPD required alternative evidence that ideally would have been from the appellant's associate pastor and the pastor with whom he sought refuge. However, it was not established that these men witnessed events or would be able to provide any details that they had not heard from the appellant about when and where the events occurred. It seems that the alternative evidence the RPD required may well have the same flaws as the evidence it considered insufficient.\n[16] In my opinion, the RPD's reasons for requiring corroborative evidence are not valid. It did not identify any [translation] \"easily obtainable\" evidence that could reasonably have been submitted and that is fundamentally different from the evidence the appellant submitted. I am not ruling out the possibility that such evidence exists, but in this case, that is not what the RPD suggested. With regard to this, I note that the appellant's wife was there during the events and the appellant states that he has maintained regular contact with her to this day. However, the appellant was not questioned on this matter. As a result, I cannot evaluate the reasons why he did not submit any evidence from his wife.\n[17] I conclude that the RPD failed to respect the presumption of truthfulness of the appellant's testimony, thus erring in its analysis of his credibility.\nThe case must be referred to the Refugee Protection Division\n[18] The RAD cannot make a decision under paragraph 111(1)(a) or (b) without hearing evidence to assess the appellant's credibility. According to subsection 110(6) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), the RAD cannot hold a hearing because there is no new evidence.\n[19] Furthermore, if the appellant's allegations are found to be credible, it will be necessary to assess the prospective risk as well as the internal flight alternative, taking into account the appellant's personal profile and the motivation and ability of the agents of persecution to find him.\nCONCLUSION\n[20] Under subsection 111(1) of the IRPA, the RAD allows the appeal, sets aside the RPD's determination and refers the matter to the RPD for re-determination by a different member than the one who rendered the determination under appeal.\n(signed)\nGuerlain Guerrier\nGuerlain Guerrier\nMay 3, 2021\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\nKanawati v.

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX (the Appellant) is a citizen of Pakistan, and he appeals a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) denying his claim for refugee protection.\n[2] The Appellant did not submit new documents in support of the appeal, and did not request a hearing under the provisions of section 110(6) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the Act or IRPA).\n[3] The Appellant requests that the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) allow \"...a new hearing by a different member\" at the RPD.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] Pursuant to ss. 111(1)(a) of the IRPA, the RAD confirms the decision of the RPD and finds that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nBACKGROUND\n[5] The Appellant alleged before the RPD that he is from XXXX, Pakistan and he had been working in Dubai since 2007. In Dubai, some acquaintances introduced him to the Shia sect and he converted in 2010. In XXXX 2013, a former schoolmate saw the Appellant coming from an Imam Bargah in XXXX. The Appellant told his classmate about his conversion from the Sunni to Shia sect of Islam. A few days later, an Imam and a few other people came to the Appellant's house and told him to recant his conversion; otherwise, he may be subjected to the death penalty. The Appellant returned to Dubai. In XXXX 2013, he returned to Pakistan because his wife was fearful of the people enquiring about him. He relocated his family within XXXX, and went back to Dubai. In XXXX 2014, the Appellant returned to Pakistan during Ramadan and he was threatened and assaulted.\n[6] The Appellant had already obtained visas to the USA and Canada in XXXX and XXXX 2014. The Appellant left Pakistan in XXXX 2014, went to the USA and, after a stay of three months, arrived in Canada towards the end of XXXX 2015, and claimed protection.\n[7] This claim was heard on June 4, 2015, and the RPD rejected the claim by written reasons dated June 18, 2015.\nROLE OF THE RAD\n[8] The Appellant did not make submissions regarding the role of the RAD in reviewing the decisions by the RPD. The Federal Court decision, Huruglica,1 provides the RAD with guidance in relation to the appropriate standard that must be applied by a specialized tribunal, such as the RAD, to decisions of a first-level administrative tribunal. Justice Phelan states in paragraphs 54 and 55 of the foregoing decision:\n[54] Having concluded that the RAD erred in reviewing the RPD's decision on the standard of reasonableness, I have further concluded that for the reasons above, the RAD is required to conduct a hybrid appeal. It must review all aspects of the RPD's decision and come to an independent assessment of whether the claimant is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. Where its assessment departs from that of the RPD, the RAD must substitute its own decision.\n[55] In conducting its assessment, it can recognize and respect the conclusion of the RPD on such issues as credibility and\/or where the RPD enjoys a particular advantage in reaching such a conclusion but it is not restricted, as an appellate court is, to intervening on facts only where there is an \"overriding and palpable error\".\n[9] The case law is still evolving, pending decision of the Federal Court of Appeal regarding the role of the RAD, but at this time Huruglica appears to be widely accepted and applied. Thus, guided by Huruglica, the RAD will conduct its own assessment of the RPD's decision and come to an independent assessment of whether the Appellant is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. Deference will be afforded to the credibility findings of the RPD or to other findings where the RPD has a particular advantage in reaching its conclusions.\nIssues\n[10] The Appellant's issue, in his words, is: \"The Member failed to provide sufficient reasons for why she did not believe the applicant was a legitimate convert to Shia Islam and the member made decision without regard to material before her.\"2\n[11] I will rephrase the issue as: is the Appellant a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection?\nAnalysis\n[12] The RPD found that the Appellant was not credible based on several errors, omissions and inconsistencies. Guided by Huruglica, the RAD recognizes and respects the RPD's credibility findings where it enjoyed a particular advantage and the RAD has conducted its own assessment of the evidence.\n[13] In the RAD's opinion, the RPD's determination is supportable based on credibility analysis. The RAD notes that the RPD questioned the Appellant about two possible internal flight alternatives in Lahore and Multan.3 The RPD could have made a finding based on a viable IFA, but did not. Therefore, even though there is sufficient credible evidence regarding IFAs, the RAD is not going to make a finding on this issue.\n[14] The RAD also notes that the Appellant provided a new narrative only after the RPD panel had declared that she had no more questions.4 To the credit of the RPD, the panel accepted and considered the new narrative, and asked a few more questions. In fact, the RPD noted in its reasons at paragraph 15:\n...I have not made any negative inferences about the claimant's credibility on this basis. I gave the claimant the benefit of the doubt that he believed he had submitted this version to the Immigration and Refugee Board (the \"Board\"), so I made all credibility findings in reference to the second narrative rather than by comparing the two.\n[15] The RPD provided cogent and transparent reasons for disbelieving the Appellant regarding his allegations of persecution due to his alleged conversion. If the Appellant's stories regarding his persecution due to alleged conversion are deemed sufficient to impugn his credibility, the RPD is not required to refer to each and every piece of evidence or issue. Conversion of one's religion is a serious matter. The Appellant testified that he changed the sect of his religion in 2010. The Appellant would be approximately 47 years old at that time. Religion is very personal and changing it requires thoughtful considerations. One would consider that is particularly so in countries like Pakistan where religious intolerance is quite high and minorities are often victims of harassment and, in extreme cases, persecution.\n[16] The Appellant's own evidence5 shows large numbers of Shia who have lost their life at the hands of extremists Sunni groups. The national documentation package provided by the board has several articles confirming sectarian wars between Shia and Sunni, and mistreatment of Ahmadi, Christian and Hindu minority groups.\n[17] Objective documentary evidence shows :\nThere were reports of societal abuses and discrimination based on religious affiliation, belief, and practice. Societal intolerance persisted, including through mob attacks and actions by violent extremists. Violent extremists in some parts of the country demanded all citizens follow their authoritarian interpretation of Islam and threatened brutal consequences if they did not. They also targeted Muslims who advocated tolerance and pluralism. There were scores of attacks on Sufi, Hindu, Ahmadi, Shia, and Christian gatherings and religious sites, resulting in numerous deaths and extensive damage.6\n[18] The Appellant submitted that conversion from Sunni to Shia in Pakistan will be considered as blasphemy. In evidence, he included three articles.7 Obviously the Appellant sincerely believes that the conversion has serious implications in Pakistan. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to consider that a decision to convert from the majority sect of Islam to a minority sect of Islam will be taken after careful and lengthy deliberations and\/or some life altering experiences.\n[19] The RPD panel asked the Appellant why did he convert, and his response was some friends convinced him to convert, and that Prophet Mohammed was a Shia.8 The RPD panel continued with the questioning as to how this decision was made, which is a serious matter; the Appellant audibly yawned and responded, \"they teach me like that.\"9\n[20] The Appellant's knowledge of Shia religion and\/or differences between the Shia and Sunni was very minimal. In response to the RPD's question about differences, the Appellant responded \"Sunnis don't like them\". I would expect a Shia to refer to himself as \"us\" and not \"them\" in the sentence above. In fact, the Appellant references the Shia as \"they\" and \"them\" a number of times. For example, in the audio recording at:\n* 21: 30- they do not marry for the 10 days (during Moharram)\n* 22:00- to show solidarity with them\n* 22:05- we pray for them\n[21] He also mentioned Shia self-flagellation rituals. The Shia conduct great processions to mourn the death of Hussein at the time of the Moharram, and during the procession the Shia engage in self-flagellation rituals using swords, method chains, and other instruments. Knowledge of this act is not unique to Shia because of the public nature of processions throughout the countries with Shia population. It is an important part of the Shia religion.\n[22] Documentary evidence10 shows that \"there are differences in ritual, law, theology and religious organization.\" It is not unreasonable for the RPD or the RAD to expect the Appellant to provide some details about the process of conversion, and\/or the differences in the two sects that persuaded the Appellant to convert. The Appellant's testimony11 that \"there are differences in proclamation\" and \"things are almost the same\", is not supported by objective documentary evidence.\n[23] I note that the Appellant's counsel is providing evidence - unsolicited evidence - about the Shia sect of Islam in the Appellant's Memorandum in paragraphs 15 to 34. This evidence was obviously in support of the Appellant's testimony regarding the number of Imams and khalifas in Sunni and Shia sects. This information was not provided to the RAD as new documents to be considered as new evidence pursuant to s. 110(4). The RAD will not consider these paragraphs as evidence. Moreover, this information is not in the Board's extensive documentary package about Pakistan.\n[24] The RPD asked the Appellant a number of questions about Shia practices and his answers were not sufficient to show, on a balance of probabilities, that he has converted. The Appellant's counsel submitted in the Memorandum that, \"It is very likely the applicant is not aware of the fact that this significant variation in traditions and assumed that it was practised by all Shia Muslims. This is especially true has (sic) most of his colleagues in Duabi (sic) were likely Pakistani migrants who practised this version of Shia Islam\".12 This, in the RAD's opinion, is a confirmation of the RPD's determination that the Appellant did not provide sufficient credible evidence of his knowledge about the Shia and, therefore, the alleged conversion.\n[25] Material Omissions: The Appellant's narrative has material omissions, including the alleged gun shots aimed at him. In explanation, the Appellant testified, \"just recalled now therefore mention now.\"13 The Appellant provided two narratives and both times confirmed, under oath, that the information was complete, true and correct. This explanation is not reasonable. Similarly, in response to the RPD's question about why beating was not mentioned, the Appellant's explanations of \"no reason\" and a little later \"just came into my mind\"14 are not reasonable.\n[26] National documentation package item 12.4 states the following regarding Shia in Pakistan:\nShi'a\nDuring the reporting period, militants and terrorist organizations targeted Shi'a processions and mosques, as well as social gathering places, with impunity. Particularly large bombings occurred at a pool hall frequented by Shi'a in Quetta in January 2013 and on a busload of Shi'a pilgrims returning from Iran in January 2014. Overall, advocacy organizations put the number of Shi'a killed across Pakistan during the past year at close to 700, with over 1000 wounded. The response by the Pakistani government has been grossly inadequate. Police, if present, have been unwilling to stop attackers before people are killed, and the government has not cracked down on the groups that repeatedly target Shi'a.\n[27] While it is clear that Shia minority members are often targeted, they are not individually targeted. The terrorists target them at Muhharam time to inflict damage to the largest number of individuals. Thus, a risk from terrorists to 45 million persons may be considered as a generalized risk for the Shia.\n[28] The Appellant initially testified that he is at risk because of his conversion; however, his testimony contradicted that, and he testified \"look at incidents. ...Everyday killings of Shia. They do not kill because of conversion, they kill everyone.\"15 The Appellant continued, \"bomb will not recognize converted or Shia\". With apparent meaning that all Shia, whether converted or born into Shia faith, are equally at risk.\n[29] Shortly after that, the Appellant attempted to demonstrate that the risk was not generalized in nature by stating that they are watching his family's movements.\n[30] The Appellant submits that the RPD provided inadequate reasons in impugning the credibility of the Appellant's conversion from the Sunni sect of Islam to the Shia sect of Islam. I am not persuaded. The RPD considered numerous errors, omissions and inconsistencies in the Appellant's testimony before the RPD, and considered the Appellant's explanation, before arriving at its determination. Having heard the audio recording, as well as having considered the evidence in the record, the RAD is able to confirm the RPD's determination.\n[31] Documentary evidence16 shows that:\nAttacks against Shias escalate during the Muslim holy month of Moharram, particularly on Shia processions marking Ashura, the 10th day of Moharram. ...Aside from the incident in Rawalpindi, Ashura passed peacefully in most of the country on account of the security measures put in place by Pakistan's law enforcement authorities. Several suspected militants were arrested in Karachi, and security cameras helped prevent terrorist activity in Lahore. [Emphasis added]\n[32] Moreover, the International Religious Freedom Report17 also shows that:\n...Shia procession in Rawalpindi left 11 people dead and another 80 injured. The Punjab government implemented a two-day curfew and suspended cell phone service in order to maintain law and order. Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif created a judicial commission to investigate the incident.\n[33] It is clear that Pakistan is not always successful in completely eliminating such attacks. The reason is simple; these attacks are conducted by extremists and terrorist groups from the majority Sunni as well as minority Shia. No jurisdiction is immune from such and\/or can prevent all attacks from terrorists. Documentary evidence18 shows that \"The Lashkar-e-Jhangvi has claimed responsibility for most of the attacks and killings. It has also killed with increasing impunity members of the Frontier Corps or police assigned to protect Shia processions, pilgrims, or Hazara neighborhoods.\"\n[34] In Imam Bargah, all Shia worshippers are expected to perform certain duties; this does not make them all high profile Shia community leaders. The letter19 from the Imam Bargah, dated XXXX XXXX, 2015, states that the Appellant has \"...volunteered his services in our organizational matters and provided Physical, Moral and Monetary support to the Organization.\" This letter states that he joined the organization on the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010.\n[35] The RPD did not specifically mention this letter; however, the RAD places little weight on this letter for the following reasons:\n* The Appellant stated in his newer narrative20 that he converted at the \"XXXX XXXX Imam Bargah\" on the XXXX XXXX 2010; however, the letter is issued by \"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\" with the same date as above.\n* The letter cited above states that the Appellant provided help in organizational matters, physical matters and moral matters. The Appellant's own testimony is that he was working in Dubai until XXXX 2014 when he went to the USA. Thus, it is not clear how he could provide organizational, physical and moral support to the \"organization\".\n* Moreover, there is no mention of the process of conversion and there is no corroborative evidence such as photographs, a certificate, etc.\n* No Zakat exemption: Shia are exempt from providing Zakat, [Islamic tithe on income and wealth]21 a form of tax on Sunnis. Documentary evidence states, \"The government collects a 2.5 percent zakat (tax) on all Sunni Muslims and distributes the funds to Sunni mosques, madrassahs, and charities. The government does not impose similar requirements on other religious groups.\"22 It would be reasonable to expect some evidence of tax exemption due to his Shia beliefs. In this there is none.\n* There is no reference about how and when he was converted from the Sunni sect to the Shia sect.\n* There is no evidence in the form of receipt of any payments made to the Imam Bargah.\n[36] The RAD also notes that the letter mentioned above names a specific cleric of \"XXXX thought XXXX XXXX XXXX and his gang\" as the agents of persecution. However, the Appellant never identified XXXX XXXX XXXX in either of his two narratives.\n[37] The UNHCR23 identified seven profiles that are at \"potential risk\" in Pakistan, and they are:\n1. Ahmadis\n2. Christians\n3. Hindus\n4. Sikhs\n5. Baha'is\n6. Shias\n7. Sufis \/ Barelvis\n[38] Regarding Shia, The UNHCR also states:\nAlthough both Sunni and Shia militant groups have engaged in acts of violence against each other over the years, according to analysts the majority of recent violent attacks were committed by Sunni militants inspired by al-Qaeda's ideology.\nIn the last year sectarian violence targeting the Shia minority, including through attacks on Shia processions and religious gatherings and sites, reportedly continued. Such attacks were carried out predominantly in the North-West of the country....\nIn the context of Pakistan, an IFA\/IRA will generally not be available in areas of FATA, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, as well as Balochistan province, which are currently affected by sustained security and military counter-insurgency operations and retaliatory militant attacks.\nWhether relocation to other urban centres, such as Karachi or Islamabad, may constitute a viable alternative, should be considered on a case-by-case basis.\n[39] Objective documentary evidence24 shows that in Pakistan, \"The U.S. government estimates the total population at 193.2 million (July 2013estimate). According to the most recent census, conducted in 1998, 95 percent of the population is Muslim (75 percent of the Muslim population is listed officially as Sunni and the other 25 percent is listed officially as Shia).\" This comes to approximately 45 million Shia that live in Pakistan.\n[40] Therefore, the Shia minority is composed of 45 million strong; greater than the population of Canada. If the situation for \"average Shia\" was as dire as the Appellant wants the RAD to believe, the documentary evidence would show.\n[41] It is recognized that Pakistan is far from perfect on the heinous issue of religious intolerance. However, based on the foregoing, I find that the Appellant is not credible on a balance of probabilities.\n[42] Therefore pursuant to section 111(1)(a) of the IRPA, the RAD confirms the determination of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nCONCLUSION\n[43] The RAD confirms the RPD's determination that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n[44] The appeal is dismissed.\n(signed)\n\"Atam Uppal\"\nAtam Uppal\nNovember 26, 2015\nDate\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD.25.02 (June 23, 2014)\nRAD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SAR : TB5-11574\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] The appeal is allowed. The Appellant, XXXX XXXX XXXX, appealed the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) decision that rejected her refugee claim. The RPD found insufficient credible evidence to establish that the Appellant has a fear of persecution by the Ethiopian government on the basis of her political opinion. The RPD further determined that the Appellant's Tigre ethnicity, in and of itself, is insufficient to support a refugee claim. The RPD also rejected the sur place claim.1\nThe RPD's reasons for decision\n[2] The RPD made negative credibility findings based on the following inconsistences and omissions in the evidence:\na. When questioned about the specifics of her active involvement in the Blue Party, the Appellant omitted in her testimony that she provided financial contributions to the party, as such was stated in the Basis of Claim (BOC), and the receipts of the financial contributions were submitted in the documentary evidence. This is a material omission because the objective country evidence indicates that such financial contribution receipts are used as informal proof of membership.2\nb. The RPD disbelieved that the Appellant was ever detained because she was internally inconsistent in her testimony as to whether she was detained in 2015 or 2017, and the BOC was silent on whether the Appellant reported to the authorities, as required, after she was released from detention.3\nc. Due to the Appellant's inconsistent testimony regarding the detention and the discrepancies in the medical report, the RPD disbelieved that the Appellant was beaten by the authorities during a protest she attended in 2015.4\nd. The psychological report did not allay the RPD's credibility concerns because the report is based on the Appellant's self-reporting, and the Appellant was not credible in regards to what she was feeling at the first sitting and other aspects of the claim. The RPD found it is not credible that the Appellant did not know that her anxiety affected her testimony until the psychologist informed her.5\ne. The RPD found the Appellant's association with the Blue Party support group in Canada is not genuine for reasons that this group was not mentioned in the BOC and its amendments; and the Appellant did not know the full name of author of the support letter or the proper name of the group.6\nf. The RPD rejected the sur place claim for reasons that her association with the Blue Party support group in Canada is not genuine; it is not credible that she was unable to ascertain on her own the threatening nature of an anonymous phone call she received in Canada; and, it is not likely that officials in Ethiopia would become aware of her activities in Canada.7\ng. The Appellant's ethnicity, in and of itself, does not support a risk of persecution because the Ethiopian government is led by ethnic Tigreans.8\nAppellant's arguments\n[3] The Appellant argued that the omissions identified by the RPD are peripheral and not material to the claim, and that the psychological report rehabilitates the RPD's credibility concerns. The omission of minor and collateral details from the BOC is not a cause of concern as the BOC is often prepared by representatives holding different views of materiality.9\nDECISION\n[4] The appeal is allowed. I substitute my own decision that the Appellant is a Convention refugee.\nROLE OF THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION (RAD)\n[5] The standard of review at the RAD is correctness on questions of law, fact, or mixed fact and law.10 The RAD can defer to an RPD finding where the RPD had a meaningful advantage in assessing the credibility of oral testimony.11 The RAD carries out its own analysis of the record, on a correctness standard, to determine whether the RPD erred.12 As the RPD had no meaningful advantage in assessing the credibility of oral testimony in this claim, I apply the standard of review of correctness to the RPD decision.\nANALYSIS\nPsychological report\n[6] Following the first sitting of the RPD hearing, the Appellant submitted a psychological report which was considered in the second sitting of the RPD hearing. The RPD made errors in the assessment of the psychological report, which led the RPD panel to dismiss the report in the assessment of the Appellant's testimony. In doing so, the RPD erred in not considering the Appellant's state of mental health during the testimony.\n[7] The psychological report determined that the Appellant was exhibiting symptoms consistent with post-traumatic stress, generalized anxiety and major depression. The psychologist found the Appellant to be deeply traumatized by the harassment, threats, violence, and fear she experienced in Ethiopia. According to the psychological report, the Appellant reported she felt confused and had difficulty hearing or speaking at the first sitting of the RPD hearing. She reported re-experiencing the traumatic events, and being distracted by negative thoughts, which adversely impacted her concentration and short-term memory. This manifested in difficulty retaining and recalling information.13\n[8] The RPD made obvious errors in its assessment of the psychological report. The RPD wrote that the psychological report stated that the RPD's questions reminded the claimant of her being interrogated which caused her to have an aversive physiological arousal, including crying.14 The RPD misconstrued the psychological report when the RPD denied the Appellant was crying at the RPD hearing.15 The psychological report did not state that the Appellant was crying at the RPD hearing, but rather that the Appellant cried during the interview with the psychologist.16\n[9] Another error of the RPD was to reject the professional opinions expressed in the psychological report because the Appellant did not convey how she was feeling to the RPD member.17 At the first sitting of the RPD hearing, the Appellant signaled a need to take a minute to recall her memories.18 As she explained at the second sitting, she did not know at the first sitting, that she had to disclose her feelings in the hearing room.19 Because psychological counselling produces self-awareness into one's mental state that can be articulated, I accept the Appellant's explanation that she only became aware of her anxiety issues after the psychologist made her aware of the fact.20\nInconsistencies in the testimony are due to the Appellant's re-traumatization\n[10] Under the heading \"Detention\", the BOC narrative described an incident in 2015 when the Appellant was beaten by police during an anti-government protest. She was able to escape arrest because the police left her to beat another protester. She lost a tooth in this incident. Further along in the BOC narrative under the heading \"Decision to leave the country\", the Appellant claimed she was detained for 8 days in XXXX 2017 for handing out leaflets opposing unfair taxation. During the detention, she was subjected to harassment and humiliation when interrogated. The Appellant was released upon bail being posted by her mother, and on the condition that the Appellant report to the police every month.21\n[11] The Appellant wavered in her testimony as to whether she was detained in 2015 or 2017: she first testified to being detained on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2015, and then she testified that she was detained on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017. She then testified that she was only detained once and that occurred in 2015. After the RPD's follow-up questions to clarify the testimony, the Appellant's testimony reverted back to 2017 as the date of the detention.22 When asked to explain the discrepancy as to whether she was detained in 2015 or in 2017, the Appellant testified that she was recalling the time she was tortured which resulted in the loss of her tooth.23\n[12] I accept the Appellant's argument that the psychological report provides an explanation for the changing testimony related to the date of the detention. I do not agree with the RPD's finding that the pauses in the testimony is an indication that she rehearsed the narrative and bungled the recitation of the narrative.24 \\\n[13]\n[14]\n[15] The RPD's explanation for the negative credibility finding lacked logic and intelligibility in associating the Appellant's birthday in XXXX with the same month of the beating at the protest.25\n[1]\n[13] Bearing in mind the psychological report when I independently reviewed the testimony, I find the discrepancies in the testimony and the explanation for the discrepancies reflect the Appellant re-experiencing the traumatic events. I accept the opinion of the psychological report that the re-traumatization distracted the Appellant's concentration and ability to recall information.26\n[14] I accept the Appellant's argument that she was pausing during the testimony in order to recall the incident.27 During the questioning related to the detention, she indicated several times that she was trying to remember in order to answer the RPD's questions. She also asked for a minute to recall facts.28 At the second sitting of the RPD hearing, the Appellant explained that she had asked for a minute at the first sitting in order to calm herself so that she could remember the events in order to answer the RPD's questions.29 I find the Appellant's need to take a moment in her testimony to recall the facts is due to the psychological state of the re-traumatization.\nOmissions in the evidence do not negatively impact the Appellant's credibility\nOmission of the financial contributions from the testimony\n[15] When asked in what ways she was an active as a member of the Blue Party, the Appellant testified that she attended student meetings, attended demonstrations, promoted the elections, and recruited student members, but she never mentioned her financial contributions,30 even though the receipts of those monetary contributions are in the documentary evidence.31\n[16] I do not draw an adverse inference from the omission. In light of the psychological report, I accept the Appellant's explanation that the financial contributions simply did not come to mind during the testimony.32 Moreover, even without the psychological report, the omission is immaterial to draw an adverse inference, given the RPD's question was about her \"active\" participation,33 and it is arguable that financial contributions are not a form of active participation. To illustrate the distinction between active participation and making financial contributions, an analogy can be made to being a volunteer versus making a financial donation. Volunteering is an active form of participation, and financial contributions are arguably more passive. As the RPD specifically asked about active participation, the Appellant responded with activities that required her active engagement, such as attending meetings, demonstrations, and promoting elections. By contrast, making a financial contribution is a passive form of support that does not require active engagement with other people.\n[17] After the RPD examined the original receipts of the financial contributions, it noted no indicia of fraud on the face of the receipts. As such, the RPD erred in assigning no weight to the receipts and in finding that the omission in the testimony materially undermined the claim that she was a member of the Blue Party in Ethiopia.34\n[18] Based on the RAD's independent review of the evidence, I find the Appellant's testimony on her involvement in the Blue Party is materially consistent with the BOC. The claim that she is a member of the Blue Party has been established by her testimony, the receipts of the financial contributions, and the objective evidence that financial contributions are proof of membership in the party.35\nOmission of the details of the brother's claim of persecution from the BOC\n[19] The BOC omitted the details that the Appellant's brother was beaten, threatened and prohibited from attending school by the Ethiopian authorities.36 The Appellant argued that her brother's experience, which caused him to claim asylum in Switzerland in 2013, is not a central aspect of her claim.37 I accept the Appellant's testimony that the BOC omitted the details about her brother's experience because she believed her refugee claim was dependent only on her own situation.38 The BOC is not intended to be an encyclopedic recitation of the evidence, and the details of the brother's experiences are collateral to the Appellant's claim.39\nOmission of family information in the visa application\n[20] The RPD erred in drawing a negative inference from the omission of the Appellant's siblings in her visa application. The Appellant testified that she omitted her siblings' information from the visa application because she was following the instructions of the person at the travel agency who prepared the visa application.40 I am guided by the jurisprudence that it is not uncommon for a person fleeing persecution to follow the instructions of the person organizing their escape, and therefore whether they were truthful in regards to the documents they use to escape has little direct bearing on whether the person indeed is a refugee.41 As such, I find the Appellant's omission of her siblings from her visa application is immaterial to the issue of credibility.\nOmission of activities in Canada from the BOC\n[21] The Appellant testified about her activities with the Blue Party in Canada, but these details are not in the BOC.42 I find the omission from the BOC about her activities in the Blue Party in Canada is a material omission with regards to the sur place claim; however, the omission does not impact the credibility of the allegations in the main claim of persecution in Ethiopia.\nExit from Ethiopia\n[22] In the RAD's independent review, I have considered items 14.2 and 14.3 in the National Documentation Package (NDP),43 and the expert opinion of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX submitted by the Appellant.44\n[23] The RPD considered the objective country conditions evidence that even low-level opposition members are at risk of being detained, jailed or killed in Ethiopia, and most opposition members who leave Ethiopia generally travel to Kenya by bus or other ground transportation to avoid being apprehended.45 The RPD correctly noted that the claimant exposed herself to a risk by choosing air travel.46 However, the Appellant argued that the RPD exaggerated the risk of choosing air travel after it misconstrued XXXX XXXX XXXX expert opinion that the Ethiopian government, on the one hand prevents party leaders from leaving the country, while on the other hand, allows rank and file party members to leave the country to prevent them from rising to leadership.47\n[24] I am guided by the Federal Court of Canada jurisprudence that the country conditions evidence indicates a risk, not an implausibility, for Ethiopians opposing the government to leave the country by air travel. Inherent in a risk is the potential outcome that the risk never actually materializes.48 I agree with the Appellant's argument that the RPD should have put the question to the Appellant as to how she perceives the risk of using air travel to leave Ethiopia before making a negative credibility finding based on the choice of air travel.\n[25] I have set aside the RPD's negative credibility findings that the Appellant was reciting rehearsed testimony and that she was not a member of the Blue Party in Ethiopia. In the absence of these negative credibility findings, I find the Appellant's decision to take a risk to depart Ethiopia by air travel is a neutral consideration in the assessment of credibility.\nReavailment to Ethiopia from the United Arab Emirates (UAE)\n[26] The RPD found the Appellant embellished the claim that her family was targeted in Ethiopia because she had the opportunity to leave Ethiopia permanently when she travelled to the UAE in XXXX 2014 for vacation, but she chose to return to Ethiopia.49 She explained that she would not be safe in Dubai given its proximity to Ethiopia.\n[27] I find the Appellant's decision to return to Ethiopia after travelling to Dubai is a neutral consideration that does not support a negative inference. Three criteria must be present for a finding of reavailment under the Convention: (a) the reavailment must be voluntary; (b) the claimant must have intended to reavail themselves of the protection of the country of nationality; and (c) the person must actually obtain such protection.50 I find the Appellant never intended to reavail herself for the protection of the state when she returned to Ethiopia; nor did she obtain such protection, because she was detained, interrogated and threatened in 2017, which instigated her to leave Ethiopia several months later.\n[28] I accept the Appellant's testimony that despite her family being targeted, she did not leave Ethiopia until 2018 because she believed her political activism could bring about change. It was after she was released from detention in XXXX 2017 that she decided to leave Ethiopia because the authorities gave her a final warning that she should join the Hewat (phonetic) Party.51 Her efforts to bring about political change are evident throughout the evidence. She had earlier testified to receiving anonymous intimidating phone calls when she was in university threatening that she should be part of the Tigray People's Liberation Front party.52 This testimony is consistent with the claims in the BOC narrative that she received phone calls attempting to intimidate her into changing her political beliefs.53\nLetters of support\n[29] The RPD erred in rejecting letters of support from the Appellant's parents and friends based on what the letters do not say, rather than what the letters contain:\na. The RPD found the parents' letter to lack credibility because it does not provide updated information about the Appellant and her parents' circumstances, and whether there were any consequences for her failure to report to the police.54\nb. The RPD assigned no weight to the letter from XXXX XXXX, the university friend who was arrested with the Appellant for protesting unfair taxes, because it does not mention the requirement for the Appellant to report to the police after she was released on bail.55\nc. The RPD assigned no weight to the letter from XXXX XXXX, the friend who asked the Appellant to join the Blue Party in Ethiopia, because it does not mention the Appellant making financial contributions.56\nd. The RPD assigned no weight to the letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX the friend of the Appellant who wrote about their high school activities, because it did not mention the Appellant's political activities.57\n[30] The Federal Court of Canada has cautioned against negative credibility findings based on what the documentary evidence does not say, as not every piece of evidence is directed to every specific point in issue. Some pieces of evidence are background information and some documents fill in gaps. No piece should be dismissed merely because it is a piece of the whole.58 Therefore, I find the RPD erred in not assessing the probative value of the letters based on what the letters say in the context of the entirety of the evidence.\n[31] Based on the RAD's independent review of the documentary evidence:\ne. I assign positive weight to the parents' letter because it corroborates the Appellant's activities with the Blue Party in Ethiopia, including the rally in 2015 wherein she was beaten, and the Appellant's arrest and detention in 2017 following her opposition to the unfair taxation of small businesses in their community. The letter describes the bail money posted for the Appellant's release; the condition of release for the Appellant to report to police; and the money collected by the family to aid her departure from Ethiopia.59\nf. I assign positive weight to the letter from XXXX XXXX which speaks to the Appellant distributing flyers to oppose unfair taxation. The author of the letter was arrested with the Appellant.60\ng. I assign positive weight to the letter from XXXX XXXX. The letter is probative of the author asking the Appellant to join the Blue Party in Ethiopia.61\nh. I assign no weight to the letter from XXXX XXXX as the letter describes the Appellant's activities in high school, which is not probative of the allegations in the claim.62\ni. I assign no weight to the medical note as it is illegible.63 It is not possible to ascertain the writing in the medical note which purports to corroborate the Appellant losing a tooth after being beaten at that protest.\n[32] As the presumption of truth has not been rebutted, I accept the Appellant's testimony that she reported to the police on the last days of the month, in accordance with the conditions of her release from detention, and she last reported to the police in XXXX 2017.64\n[33] I find sufficient evidence to establish that the incidents in Ethiopia support a forward-facing fear of persecution based on political opinion if the Appellant returns to Ethiopia. As I have accepted the main refugee claim, it is not necessary to assess the sur place claim.\nCONCLUSION\n[34] The appeal is allowed. I substitute my own decision that the Appellant is a Convention refugee.\n(signed)\nT. Cheung\nT.

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX, a Nigerian citizen, appeals the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) denying his refugee claim for general lack of credibility. The Appellant argues that the RPD's finding was based upon irrelevant considerations and a microscopic assessment of his evidence. He has not submitted any new evidence in support of the appeal and asks the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) to set aside the decision of the RPD and find him to be a Convention Refugee or person in need of protection, or, in the alternative, refer his claim back to the RPD for redetermination.\n[2] This appeal raises the issue of sexual orientation. The panel has taken into consideration Chairperson's Guideline 9: Proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression (SOGIE), recognizing that there is no standard set of criteria that can be relied upon to establish an individual's identification as an individual with diverse SOGIE and that many individuals feel the need to conceal their identities in their country of reference out of fear of repercussion by state and non-state actors, or due to experiences of stigmatization and violence.1\nDETERMINATION OF THE APPEAL\n[3] Pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(c) and subsection 111(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), the RAD allows the appeal and refers the matter back to the RPD for redetermination by a differently constituted panel.2 The RAD is unable to confirm or set aside the RPD's decision without hearing evidence presented to the RPD with respect to credibility of the Appellant. The RAD's independent assessment in this matter was compromised, as 53 minutes of the oral hearing testimony was unable to be listened to, having not been captured properly due to a technical recording problem. Credibility issues surrounding the basis of the claim remain outstanding on evidence that was not included in the RPD's decision and may not have been tested by the RPD at the oral hearing.3\nBACKGROUND\n[4] Mr. XXXX alleged before the RPD that he travelled to Canada in XXXX 2013 to further his studies. He was preparing to return to Nigeria when he heard from a friend that a former long-term partner, XXXX, had divulged to police and an angry mob that he had engaged in unlawful sexual relations with the Appellant, after having been beaten almost to death on 30 August 2013.4 Sedo's friends had discovered he was gay and recorded evidence of this, which was used along with text messages from the Appellant in a police interrogation. The Appellant's parents, wife, and friends were interviewed by police and questioned on his whereabouts, insisting they would want to interrogate him upon return to Nigeria.5\n[5] The Appellant alleges that his mother informed him that his father wished to kill him after being informed by police of the evidence that he is gay, and that his father called him a pig and repeated the death threat in response to an attempted explanation through correspondence from the Appellant.6\n[6] While in Canada, in September 2014, the Appellant says he was approached at the 519 Community Centre by XXXX, a friend of a friend of his and XXXX in Lagos, and was asked if what he had heard about their relationship was true. The Appellant claims he now fears this person will inform their friends in Nigeria that the Appellant is involved in \"the practice\" here as well.7\n[7] The RPD found that Mr. XXXX was generally not credible and, therefore, not bisexual as he claims to be and, further, that his participation in the Canadian LGBTQ community is solely to bolster his claim for protection.8\nROLE OF THE RAD\n[8] The RAD's role is to carry out its own analysis of the record to determine whether, as submitted by the Appellant, the RPD erred. The RAD applies the standard of correctness to questions of fact, mixed fact and law, in accordance with the Federal Court of Appeal's decision in Huruglica.9 In assessing findings of credibility of oral testimony, the RAD will apply the standard of reasonableness, modified for the RAD context, in situations where the RPD enjoys a meaningful advantage.10 Unless otherwise stated, the RAD uses the correctness standard on all findings and will make the overall refugee determination on a standard of correctness.\nISSUE IN APPEAL\n[9] At issue in this appeal is whether the RPD erred in finding that the Appellant's identity as a bisexual man was not established.\nANALYSIS OF THE MERITS OF THE APPEAL\n[10] In conducting this analysis, the RAD is mindful that, while an individual's experiences and behaviours related to their sexual orientation may be expressed in both the private and public spheres, an individual's testimony may, in some cases, be the only evidence of their sexual orientation, and, in a given case, corroborative or additional evidence may not reasonably be available. In this case, a substantial amount of documentary evidence was produced in support of Mr. XXXX claim. Only a small portion of it was referenced in the RPD's decision.\n[11] The Appellant argues that the RPD unreasonably assessed the evidence and based negative credibility findings on irrelevant considerations, while ignoring evidence central to the claim:\n(a) Credibility findings related to the Appellant's meeting of his wife are irrelevant to the basis of the claim, his sexual orientation.11\n(b) RPD findings related to dealings with an agent who arranged a study permit and efforts to attend Centennial College contained errors of fact and selective assessment of evidence.12\n(c) The RPD's finding that a letter of support from the 519 Community Centre should be expected to include reference to an encounter described to the author was unreasonable, as this was not the purpose of the letter.13\n(d) The panel's finding that the Appellant's participation with the LGBTQ community was solely to bolster his claim for protection is based on unreasonable inferences from the evidence.14\n(e) It was unreasonable for the RPD to find that the 04 September 2014 Nigeria Police Invitation was insufficient to support the allegation that the Appellant has ever been sought by the police for reason of his sexual orientation, relying on the fact that it lacks enumerated criminal allegations and was submitted on 21 November 2014 without being mentioned in an amended Basis of Claim (BOC) or supported by any other evidence sourced to the Nigerian police. The panel did not point to any evidence to suggest what an invitation from the Nigerian police should look like.15\n(f) The RPD ignored: a letter from the Appellant's mother asking him to change his sexual orientation and warning that his father planned to kill him; an affidavit from a similarly situated person who also fled Nigeria after being named by XXXX; and a letter from a friend informing that the Appellant was still sought after and at risk upon return. This provided evidence to establish that the Appellant's sexual orientation is known, that his former partners have been persecuted, and that he is still in danger upon return as he is wanted by police. The RPD failed, as required, to analyze and weigh all of the evidence directly relevant to the basis of the claim and which could materially affect the claim.16\nRPD findings based on peripheral considerations irrelevant to this claim\nCircumstances under which the Appellant met his wife\n[12] The hearing questions and decision of the RPD were not aimed at the genuineness of Mr. XXXX relationship with his wife, XXXX; yet, negative credibility findings were made in relation to perceived discrepancies as to how they met. In the RAD's opinion, the noted discrepancies were not rationally related to the credibility of the Appellant's sexual orientation but were instead peripheral to this determination. Knowing how the Appellant met his wife does not further an analysis of his evidence, as it relates to his attraction to and relationships with men.\n[13] The Appellant's wife, XXXX, swore an affidavit including information relevant to the basis of this refugee claim including: that the Appellant revealed to her his sexual history with male friends; that she has been made to leave the family house by the Appellant's father, who is angry about the information he has come to know about the Appellant's relationship with XXXX; that she has been summoned and questioned by Owerri police about the Appellant's alleged relations with XXXX; and that the Appellant's father wants him to return to punishment for being gay, to save his social image.17\n[14] The RPD's decision discounts all of the above statements, focusing on a brief mention in the affidavit that XXXX and the Appellant met while she was preparing to go for National Youth Service.18 An implausibility finding was made due to a perceived discrepancy with the Appellant's testimony stating that she did not complete National Youth Service and that they met in a hair salon. This finding is problematic and unsupportable, since the discrepancy is not a real one, preparing and completing are different things. The Appellant testified that he began National Service in 2009; they met during his break period that year, and XXXX was not in the Service but working in a Lagos hair salon. They started dating after he completed the Service in 2010.19 The RPD here is questioning the way the Appellant met his wife, yet is not making findings on the genuineness of that relationship. It is incorrect to use this finding to both not consider the portions of the affidavit relevant to the claim and to support an overall negative credibility assessment, since it is simply not a critical consideration in assessing the genuineness of the Appellant's allegations.\nUse of an agent for Canadian visa application and payment of school fees\n[15] Mr. XXXX claims to have arrived in Canada with the intention of going to college and that this did not happen because he was defrauded by a Nigerian agent and elected not to pay school fees once he discovered in Canada that this had not been done on his behalf. Whatever his reasons for arriving in Canada in XXXX 2013, he claims that the reason he remains until now is because his former partner, XXXX, made him a target of police, his community and family for the reason of their disclosed sexual relationship, on 30 August 2013.\n[16] The RPD's decision focused significantly on the Appellant's visa application, his alleged dealings with the alleged defrauding agent, and the payment of school fees. The panel found that the Appellant omitted details about the existence of an agent in the Schedule 12 and that it was implausible that the agent would have included the Appellant's email address on the visa application, if he intended to defraud him. The Appellant's explanation of why he did not attend the school for which he was provided a study permit, beginning in January 2013, was not accepted, nor was his explanation of apparent discrepancies on the visa application form indicating he was sponsored by an employer, XXXX XXXX XXXX, who may also be his uncle.20 The Appellant testified that he does not know Mr. XXXX, and this false information was included in the visa application by the alleged agent.21 The panel found that no agent was used and that bank statements provided as evidence of payments to the agent were not reliable. While these findings, if supported by the evidence, could support a decision that the Appellant is not a bona fide international student, the RAD cannot agree that this has any bearing on his true sexual orientation.\n[17] Whether or not the Appellant used an agent to enter Canada, intended to attend school, paid tuition fees, or provided bank statements showing he had been defrauded are all peripheral considerations irrelevant to this particular claim. A negative inference on the overall credibility of the Appellant was made by the RPD on the basis of these considerations.22\n[18] The RPD's negative credibility assessment here relates to a reason for being in Canada during a particular time period, but not a reason for persecution or issues relevant to identity as a gay man. The Appellant's persecution as a gay man allegedly began as early as the 1990's, but the fear basing this claim is the Appellant's more recent outing by XXXX, while the Appellant was in Canada in 2013. The RAD finds the evidence and findings relating to school registration irrelevant to the claim for this reason.\n[19] Assuming the Appellant's Canadian studies were sponsored, tuition was paid, and that a student permit was validly issued on this basis without the assistance of an agent, in conformity with the Minister's and contrary to the Appellant's evidence, the question still remains: is the account of the Appellant's bisexual orientation credible? While the RAD finds the inconsistencies related to the visa application were not minor in nature, they are not central to the claim of persecution as a criminalized sexual minority in Nigeria. The Appellant was questioned at length about his sexual history with boys and men and gay community involvement, from 1996-2017, and no negative credibility findings were made by the RPD related to this testimony, nor does the RAD have reason to doubt the testimony.23\n[20] Mr. XXXX provided several support letters from LGBTQ organizations, including two from the 519 Community Centre. The first letter, dated 18 November 2014, confirms membership in a peer support group for LGBT refugee claimants and completion of an orientation session one month prior.24 A later letter, dated 19 April 2017, confirms that the Appellant attends group meetings and workshops as often as possible. The Appellant was asked whether he spoke to the author of these letters about the incident with XXXX and, confirming that he had, the RPD \"expected the letters of support to address the claimant's concerns about his participation with an organization which happened to be the exact location of an event that caused the claimant sufficient concern for his future safety...\".25 The RAD does not follow the reasoning here. The purpose of the support letters was to confirm attendance and membership in the organization, which they did. The RAD does not find it suspect that an incident prior to membership and outside the organization would not be included therein. This should not have impacted the credibility assessment.\nDating profile indicating interest in women\n[21] The IRCC Minister introduced information from a dating site indicating that the Appellant was interested in dating young women. The RPD agreed with submissions that this casts doubt on the Appellant's bisexual orientation, as he has the freedom to engage in relations with whomever he wishes. In the RAD's opinion, as Mr. XXXX claims to be bisexual, a dating profile indicating interest in dating women and not both men and women, or only men, is not suspect. When confronted with the profile, the Appellant confirmed that he created it in 2014 as a cover, after meeting Wale at the 519 Community Centre, out of concern that he had been identified as a gay man here and that this could be relayed to others acquainted with him and Wale in Nigeria.26 This appears to be a complete answer, and it is unclear from the decision what credibility inferences were made by the RPD in this regard.\nRPD did not address relevant evidence\n[22] While the RPD did not address the following evidence in its decision or the recorded portion of the oral hearing, the RAD has reviewed it as part of its independent assessment.\nLetter from the Appellant's mother\n[23] A formally formatted letter, including full names and addresses of the author and recipient as well as fingerprint of the author, has been provided by the Appellant's mother, notarized in 2017. While it states that this was a better way to \"pour out [her] heart\" than usual phone calls, the formality of the letter appears to be at odds with this statement. The letter asks that the Appellant discontinue sexual relations with men and reiterates that his father will secretly kill him whenever they meet again or the police and community will have him arrested. She claims to have heard extensive rumours that police are searching for all of XXXX partners and that he will never go to trial, instead being left to die there.27 The Appellant argues that the letter confirms that his father is planning to kill him when he sees him next, and for this reason, it was necessary for this document to have been weighed in the RPD's credibility assessment.28 The issue of the RPD ignoring evidence is one of correctness. The RAD agrees that this document appears to have been ignored and is directly relevant to the Appellant's account of events and future risk in Nigeria, as argued by the Appellant. In the absence of the full hearing recording and the RPD's weighing of the evidence, the RAD is unable to make a credibility finding related to this document.\nXXXX XXXX letter and affidavit\n[24] In a formal notarized letter, dated 20 April 2017, the Appellant's friend, XXXX XXXX, states that he had lost the Appellant's phone contact after speaking last and asks to be contacted by phone. He explains that he thought of writing after speaking to the Appellant's mother. He urges him not to remain \"a same sex guy for life\", and he states that a person having similarly been named to police by XXXX returned to Nigeria from hiding and was \"immediately sighted by community boys who knew him notwithstanding the length of time of the incident. He was almost burned to death before he was taken away again by the police exactly how it happened with Mr. XXXX.\" He claims the community wants \"jungle justice of death\" for anyone in the situation of the Appellant, victims of same-sex relationships.29\n[25] XXXX XXXX had also written an affidavit, dated 21 November 2014. He states in the earlier affidavit that he has been in email contact with the Appellant to assist with this refugee claim and to give updates \"about the situation at home\".30 He claims to have witnessed the mob attack and lynching of XXXX and XXXX rescue from the mob and detention by police.31 He states also that he was at the police station \"as an observer\" when police requested XXXX phone password to gain access to text messages and photographs. Police had XXXX read aloud the messages while they beat him, for entertainment of \"the mobs\".32 He also saw the Appellant's upset father at the police station.33 He further states that he later returned to the station and was told that XXXX had been transferred to another detention centre and that he knows police are hunting for all the people XXXX disclosed as sexual partners \"to be brought to book\".34\n[26] The RAD draws a negative inference as to the authenticity of the documents because of the difference in reported modes of communication between 2014 and 2017. XXXX claims to have been in contact by email in 2014 and furnished letters to the Appellant's address in Canada over several years. Also, it seems suspect that phone contact is later the only mode of communication mentioned and that, having obtained the Appellant's mailing address through his mother, the phone number could not have also been requested. The letter from the Appellant's mother states that she is in regular phone contact with her son. The Appellant has provided evidence to show that he is in contact with friends and family by email, though the email address owners cannot be verified.35\nAffidavits sworn in 2014\n[27] An affidavit from a man, XXXX XXXX, who also fled Nigeria after being named by XXXX was provided in November of 2014. It confirms the relationship between XXXX and the Appellant, though states that it ended prior to dating XXXX. XXXX states that he was present when XXXX was taken to the police station and confessed and named them both as former sexual partners. He fled to Ghana and advised that all persons mentioned by XXXX have to stay in hiding as he had been told by friends and family that they are all wanted by police. The RAD agrees that this document appears to have been ignored and is directly relevant to the Appellant's account of events and future risk in Nigeria, as argued by the Appellant.\n[28] Additionally, the RPD did not address sworn affidavits from the Appellant's mother and aunt, both dated 18 November 2014. The Appellant's mother wrote about information relevant to the basis of this refugee claim including that: she fears as a result of his sexual orientation, her son will be killed or severely harmed by his father or community members or imprisoned by Nigerian authorities; she made arrangements to send the Appellant to Canada as a result of this safety concern; police have been to her home and requested the Appellant for interrogation; she is aware that the Appellant's father has been to the police station, where he has confronted XXXX and been shown pictures and text messages, among other recorded documentation of her son's sexual relations with XXXX; and that her husband intends to secretly kill their son once he returns to Nigeria.\n[29] The Appellant's aunt similarly wrote that: she is aware that the Appellant is wanted by police, the community and the authorities; she was told by the Appellant's mother a long time ago that he was gay and now believes this having learned about the relationship with XXXX; the Appellant's father, like a madman, wants to kill him for disgracing the family and the father's strong reputation within the church community; and she helped finance the Appellant's journey to Canada.36 The RAD finds that these documents are directly relevant to the Appellant's account of events and future risk in Nigeria and it was incorrect to not weigh them in making a credibility assessment. In the absence of the full hearing recording and RPD reasons, the RAD is unable to make a credibility finding related to these documents.\nOutstanding Credibility Issues\nInvitation to Police\n[30] A document from \"Nigeria Police\" with an issue date of 04 September 2014 was addressed to the Appellant at his family home in Lagos. The RPD found that the Invitation to Police was not credible on its face and for lack of corroboration. The Appellant does not believe the panel has reason to question the document, as it did not refer to evidence of a genuine example.\n[31] The RAD is unable to find reference to it in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Nigeria, though item 6.13 indicates that \"there are no specific documents\" such as warrants of arrest used by police, and that items that may be used in cases related to same-sex activity include other private items from the scene of arrest, such as photographs and videos. The police can make arrests based on contents found on a person's phone, such as photos or videos suggesting same-sex activities. Sometimes someone who confesses to same-sex activity to the police may be \"coerced into outing other persons believed to be engaged in same-sex sexual relations.\" There have been reports of the police arresting people suspected of same-sex activity, and then finding their contacts on their phone and arranging meetings where they further arrest their contacts. Police sometimes use force and invasion of privacy when investigating individuals for suspected same-sex activity and usually do not issue a warrant of arrest in related cases.37 The RAD finds that this describes Nigerian police practice in dealings with persons believed to be engaged in same-sex sexual relations to be coercive and less than transparent. The objective documentation also shows that there is \"hardly any documentation\" involved in police investigations related to same-sex activity unless they go to court.38 This invitation bears a Nigeria Police logo, however the copy available to the RAD is not clear enough to show whether the name of the issuing police formation is included. It does not appear to be printed on a letterhead. The RAD evaluates the document with all of this in mind.\n[32] The RAD is not of the opinion that the RPD's consideration that there are no criminal allegations enumerated on the invitation, or further reasons for the invitation and investigation, is justified in support of finding that it provides insufficient corroboration to support the allegation that the Appellant was sought by Lagos police for being identified as bisexual. Many arrests related to same-sex activity are done out of police suspicion, without a clear justification for the arrest and a mere allegation or accusation that a person is engaged in same-sex relations can draw police attention.39\n[33] The RAD finds it can assign little weight to the letter for the following reasons: the document is meant to support the Appellant's account that he is being sought by police after the events he recounted; it would be the best evidence of this, if genuinely issued by the Nigerian police. XXXX XXXX is invited to see the officer in charge monitoring the Office of the Area Commander for the Nigeria Police Force HQ at Festac Town, Lagos, which is the office investigating a case reported on 30 August 2014. The invitation reads: \"It is just a fact finding invitation and your very co-operations will be appreciated.\"40\n[34] The invitation is dated 04 September 2014. The Appellant testified in April 2017 that it was delivered to his family address on 13 September 2014, three days after a phone conversation with his mother and father, and his mother forwarded it to him. The Appellant signed his narrative, excluding mention of the invitation on 25 September 2014. The RAD agrees with the RPD that omission of the document from original disclosure and amended BOC to the RPD on 17 October 2014 does cause concern as to its credibility. There was also no amendment following receipt of the important update that, in or around March 2015, the police came in search of him at his home, as he had not followed through with the invitation to Festac police headquarters. This was only disclosed in response to questioning at the 2017 oral hearing. The omissions of the Appellant's strongest evidence are serious and undermine the credibility of the document and account of follow up for non-compliance with it as confirmation of being actively sought by police.\nRecent partners\n[35] Mr. XXXX also did not produce some of the best evidence available to him in Canada. He claims to have had several relationships, lasting five months or more, with men in Toronto but did not provide sworn or witness testimony from these alleged partners.41\nXXXX encounter outside the 519 Community Centre\n[36] The RPD made an implausibility finding based on XXXX being \"helpful and supportive enough to accompany a friend to the 519 support centre for LGBT individuals in a well-known and well-identified positive space neighbourhood of Toronto, while at exactly the same time threatening to expose a fellow Nigerian to his community back home.\"42 Mr. XXXX described in his BOC narrative: \"XXXX informed me that he only just accompanied a friend to the centre\".43 He testified, to the contrary, that he did not know why XXXX was on Church Street, as XXXX had never mentioned why. When confronted with why XXXX would be supportive of an LGBT friend but not the Appellant, he continued saying XXXX could have just been in the neighbourhood. The Appellant's oral testimony that \"he never mentioned anything like that\"44 was, however, not the basis of an RPD finding. The oral hearing recording was interrupted during the Appellant's explanation to the panel's questioning on why XXXX was in the general downtown area of the community centre. The RAD is concerned that further elaboration was given on the apparent discrepancy between the BOC narrative and testimony above and, as such, cannot make a credibility finding.\nCONCLUSION\n[37] While the RPD states that it does not find the Appellant to be credible with respect to the central issues of his claim for protection as alleged, the RAD is of the opinion that the inconsistency findings underpinning its overall decision that the Appellant is not bisexual were unsupported and made on peripheral issues to the claim. The overall finding did not address all relevant personal supporting documents. The RPD's reasons for decision and treatment of the evidence are insufficient to maintain the determination that Mr. XXXX is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\n[38] The RAD, however, is not in a position to decide whether Mr. XXXX faces a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground or faces a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment, if returned to Nigeria. In this case, credibility issues remain outstanding on evidence presented to the RPD, as described above, and this evidence was not tested by the RPD. Where the RAD is unable to confirm or set aside and substitute its own decision without hearing evidence that was presented to the RPD, paragraph 111(2)(b) of the IRPA allows the RAD to return the case to the RPD for redetermination.\nDISPOSITION\n[39] Accordingly, pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(c) and subsection 111(2) of the IRPA, the RAD allows the appeal and refers the matter to the RPD for redetermination by a differently constituted panel.\n(signed)\n\"Christine Houde\"\nChristine Houde\nDecember 18, 2017\nDate\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD.25.02 (June 23, 2014)\nRAD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SAR : TB7-12312\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] The appellants XXXX XXXX XXXX and Unknown XXXX XXXX, husband and wife, are citizens of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). They are appealing against the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejecting their refugee protection claims by determining that they are not \"Convention refugees\" or \"persons in need of protection\" within the meaning of section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\n[2] The appellants did not submit any new evidence in support of their appeal. They are not requesting a hearing under subsection 110(6) of the IRPA.\n[3] The Minister did not intervene on appeal.\nDETERMINATION OF THE APPEAL\n[4] Under subsection 111(1) of the IRPA, the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) confirms the RPD's determination that XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX are not \"Convention refugees\" or \"persons in need of protection\" within the meaning of section 97 of the IRPA.\n[5] The appeal is dismissed.\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n[6] The male appellant is the principal claimant. The female appellant is basing her refugee protection claim on that of her husband. The appellants left the DRC in XXXX 2008 to attend the wedding of one of their children living in the United States. They arrived in Canada on June 10, 2008, with visitor visas, which were renewed four times. Their visitor status expires on November 28, 2016. They claimed refugee protection in July 2015.\n[7] The evidence on the record suggests that, in the DRC, the principal claimant was working for the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as an official at the head office. In the Basis of Claim Form (BOC Form) he states that he lost his job in 2004 because of the economic situation in the country.\n[8] He also states that he was hospitalized for fatigue on a few occasions because of his job. Allegedly, despite his hospitalization, no diagnosis was confirmed. According to the information in the BOC Form, his boss had political problems that had repercussions on him.\n[9] In Canada since 2008, the refugee protection claimants have been taking care of their grandchildren. In 2012, the male refugee protection claimant was hospitalized and was reportedly diagnosed with XXXX XXXX disorder. The male claimant has been taking medication since then and is being treated by a psychiatrist.\n[10] The male refugee protection claimant is claiming Canada's protection for three reasons. First, he alleges that he cannot return to the DRC because the medical services there are of poor quality. Second, he points out the situation of insecurity in the country. Third, he would have no place to live because his two homes are occupied by his family members.\nNotice of intervention before the RPD\n[11] On September 14, 2015, the representative of the Minister of Public Safety of Canada filed a notice of intervention. He submitted that the appellants' behaviour does not reflect a well-founded fear of persecution. The Minister's representative pointed out, in particular, that the claimants arrived in Canada in 2008 and did not claim refugee protection until 2015, that they renewed their passports with the Congolese authorities and that they renewed their visitor status four times.1\n[12] The Minister's representative requested that the RPD find that the refugee protection claims have no credible basis.\nImpugned decision\n[13] On October 2, 2015, the RPD rejected the refugee protection claim by determining that the refugee protection claimants had not discharged their burden of establishing a serious possibility of persecution on one of the five Convention grounds, or that their lives would be personally subjected to one of the risks set out in section 97 of the IRPA. The RPD decision is summarized as follows:\n- With regard to the ground relating to the principal claimant's health, it is not consistent with any of the grounds set out in section 96 of the IRPA. The RPD had no evidence [translation] \"suggesting that it is because of the male claimant's mental health that the Congolese government would refuse to treat him.\" In light of section 97 of the IRPA, the RPD stated that the ground relating to the lack of health care in the DRC is part of an exclusion under subparagraph 97(1)(b)(iv);\n- With regard to the situation of insecurity relating to the political instability in the DRC, the RPD was of the opinion that it is a generalized risk. According to the RPD, the claimants did not establish that the risk to which they could be subjected if they returned is a personal risk that differs from the generalized risk to which other Congolese citizens are subjected;\n- With regard to the ground that they no longer have anywhere to live because their family members are living in their two residences, the RPD pointed out that these people were living in their residence well before they left the DRC. The RPD drew a negative inference because of the long delay (seven years in this case) before claiming refugee protection in Canada;\n- Finally, the RPD raised the omissions in the BOC Form, in particular, with regard to the fact that the claimants state that they fear physical violence from family members because of their interethnic marriage. Moreover, the RPD drew a negative inference regarding the principal claimant's credibility because of an inconsistency in the evidence involving his personal history and his work.\nGROUNDS OF APPEAL AND REMEDY SOUGHT\nAllegations of the appellants\n[14] The appellants submit that the RPD erred in assessing their refugee protection claims. They argue the following points, among other things:\n- The RPD based its decision on irrelevant factors that were not determinative. According to them, the RPD [translation] \"was overzealous in the analyzing details of secondary elements\" that have no effect on the alleged fear. When assessing their refugee protection claims, the RPD did not take into account their particular situation, specifically their age or their health;\n- The RPD's decision lacks consistency and is unintelligible;\n- The RPD was expeditious in its analysis of the evidence by concluding that there is no risk of persecution if they returned;\n- The RPD erred by criticizing the claimants for their delay in claiming refugee protection and did not take into account that they have valid status in Canada;\n- The RPD erred by failing to take into account all the evidence.\nROLE AND FUNCTIONS OF THE RAD\n[15] On this topic, in their memorandum, the appellants rely on the decision in Dunsmuir2 and submit that the RPD's decision is unreasonable because it lacks justification and intelligibility.\n[16] Since filing their memorandum, the Federal Court had the opportunity to deal with the topic of the RAD's role. In Huruglica,3 the Federal Court of Appeal ruled on the issue of whether it was reasonable for the RAD, when credibility was not an issue, to examine findings of fact, or of mixed fact and law, by applying the standard of reasonableness.\n[17] Interpreting the legislation and recalling Parliament's intent in creating the RAD, Justice Gauthier notes:\n[98] The RAD was essentially viewed as the safety net that would catch all mistakes made by the RPD, be it on the law or the facts.\n[18] Parliament's intent should be determined by referring first to the legislation, specifically to sections 110 and 111 of the IRPA. With regard to these sections, the Court of Appeal states:\n[59] ...Paragraph 111(2)(a) does not distinguish between errors of law, fact or mixed fact and law. It simply requires that the decision of the RPD be \"wrong in law, in fact or in mixed fact and law\" ....\n[64] The ordinary meaning of the word \"wrong\" is \"not correct or true\", \"incorrect\", \"mistaken\": The Oxford English Dictionary, 3d ed., s.v. \"wrong\". The French version \"erron\u00e9e\" has the exact same ordinary meaning, that is, \"fausse\", \"incorrecte\", \"inexacte\", \"mal fond\u00e9e\": Le nouveau petit Robert, 2006, s.v. \"erron\u00e9\". This wording definitively points to the standard of correctness. In addition, the legislator's intent to use the word \"wrong\" in its ordinary meaning is, in my view, supported by the legislative history, to which I will refer later.\n[19] After providing examples of situations that might occur, the Court of Appeal states that the level of deference \"owed in each case\" varies, and concludes:\n[78] [T]he role of the RAD is to intervene when the RPD is wrong in law, in fact or in fact and law. This translates into an application of the correctness standard of review. If there is an error, the RAD can still confirm the decision of the RPD on another basis. It can also set it aside, substituting its own determination of the claim, unless it is satisfied that it cannot do either without hearing the evidence presented to the RPD: paragraph 111(2)(b) of the IRPA.\n[20] In response to the certified question reformulated by the Court of Appeal, the Honourable Justice Gauthier held:\n[103] ... [W]ith respect to findings of fact (and mixed fact and law) such as the one involved here, which raised no issue of credibility or oral evidence, the RAD is to review RPD decisions applying the correctness standard. Thus after carefully considering the RPD decision, the RAD carries out its own analysis of the record to determine whether, as submitted by the appellant, the RPD erred. Having done this, the RAD is to provide a final determination of the merits of the refugee claim. It is only when the RAD is of the opinion that it cannot provide such a final determination without hearing the oral evidence presented to the RPD that the matter can be referred back to the RPD for redetermination.\n[21] Taking into account what has been decided, I will conduct an independent analysis of the evidence in order to come to my own conclusion regarding these refugee protection claims and determine whether the decision by the RPD is correct. If an error in fact, law, or mixed fact and law was made, I will intervene using one of the means set out in sections 110 and 111 of the IRPA\nMERITS OF THE APPEAL\n[22] The RPD stated that the claimants did not discharge their burden of proof under sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA. It also noted certain aspects of credibility.\n[23] In Huruglica, Justice Gauthier states that the amount of deference owed to the RPD \"ought to be addressed on a case-by-case basis.... [T]he RAD ought to determine whether the RPD truly benefited from an advantageous position, and if so, whether the RAD can nevertheless make a final decision in respect of the refugee claim.\"4\n[24] Having carefully reviewed the evidence on the record and considered the arguments presented, I am of the opinion that the RPD rendered the appropriate decision.\nGround relating to the principal claimant's health\n[25] On this ground, the RPD indicated in paragraph 34:\n[translation]\n...the medical ground cited by the male claimant as part of his refugee protection claim, namely, his health and the lack of appropriate medical care in the DRC, has no nexus to any Convention ground set out in section 96 of the IRPA. This medical ground has no nexus to the male claimant's race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. In this case, there is no evidence that suggests that it is because of the male claimant's mental health that the Congolese government would refuse to treat him.\n[26] The RPD analyzed this ground in light of section 97 of the IRPA and concluded that:\n[translation]\n...the lack of medical care in the DRC cited by the male claimant is part of an exclusion under subparagraph (b)(iv) of this section: the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care. Consequently, the male claimant cannot be recognized as a person in need of protection by reason of his country's inability to provide him with adequate health or medical care.\n[27] According to paragraph 3(g) of the Rules, appellants must file a record that includes, among other things, the RPD's decision, all or part of the transcript of the RPD hearing, any documents the RPD refused to accept but that the appellant wants to rely on in the appeal, as well as a memorandum containing full and detailed submissions regarding, in particular: (a) the errors that are the grounds of the appeal; (b) where the errors are located in the RPD's written decision, in the transcript of the hearing or in any audio or electronic recording of the hearing; and (c) the decision the appellant wants the RAD to make.5 (RAD's emphasis)\n[28] Other than the fact that, in the memorandum, the appellants note the RPD's findings, stating that [translation] \"the Board argues that the fact that the male claimant cannot receive adequate medical care in the DRC does not constitute a valid basis for a refugee protection claim on a Convention ground\",6 they do not make any arguments against the findings regarding the alleged fear in connection with the principal claimant's health problems.\n[29] After reviewing all the evidence, I am of the opinion that the RPD's findings are correct and take into account the legislation and the applicable principles from case law. The evidence on the record does not make it possible to link the principal claimant's health problems to one of the grounds set out in section 96 of the IRPA. Moreover, the evidence does not establish that the male appellant was discriminated against on one of the Convention grounds in terms of the quality of the health care that he allegedly received in the DRC. The RPD was correct to analyze this ground under section 97 of the IRPA.\n[30] The evidence on the record reveals that health services in the DRC are of poor quality and that the male appellant was allegedly hospitalized on various occasions but that he was not given any diagnosis. It was only once he was in Canada that he was allegedly diagnosed with XXXX and XXXX disorder.\n[31] According to subparagraph 97(1)(b)(iv) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the risk to life or the risk of cruel and unusual treatment must be caused by the inability of the country of return to provide adequate medical or health care.7 In Covarrubias, the Federal Court states that:\n... the intent of the legislative scheme was to exclude claims for protection under section 97 based on risks arising from the inadequacy of health care and medical treatment in the claimant's country of origin, including those where treatment was available for those who could afford to pay for it.... Lack of appropriate health or medical care are not grounds for granting refugee protection under the Act.\nGround relating to the situation of insecurity\n[32] The RPD analyzed the evidence on the record in relation to the two applicable legislative provisions and determined that the claimants did not discharge their burden of establishing a serious possibility of persecution on one of the Convention grounds or that, on a balance of probabilities, they would be personally subjected to one of the risks set out in section 97 of the IRPA.\n[33] Again, I point out that, in their memorandum, the appellants make no submissions or provide any explanations regarding the errors committed by the RPD in the analysis of this ground for their refugee protection claims.\n[34] With regard to the insecurity in the country, it should be recalled that, in Jarada,8 the Federal Court indicates that the fact that the documentary evidence shows that the human rights situation in a country is problematic does not necessarily mean there is a risk to a given individual.\n[35] To allow a claim under subparagraph 97(1)(b)(ii), the claimants must establish that their risk is different from the \"generalized risk\" which is faced by all or part of the Congolese population. However, the evidence on the record does not make it possible to establish that the situation of insecurity would target them personally or differently than other citizens.\nGround relating to having no place to live and credibility\n[36] The final ground alleged in support of a fear of returning to the DRC is based on the fact that family members are living in the two residences that they own in Kinshasa. They fear that, if they returned, the latter would not want to leave and, in that case, they would not have the financial means to exercise their rights before the courts.\n[37] The RPD considered that the family members had been living in their homes since well before their departure from the DRC and that the claimants did not claim refugee protection when they arrived because of this ground, which was indeed known to them. The RPD also considered that the male refugee protection claimant contradicted himself with regard to the identity of the people whom he fears. First, he stated that it was cousins who were living in their residences. Later, he stated that it was nephews and cousins.\n[38] The appellants submit that these factors are not significant and that the RPD was overzealous in assessing their credibility in this regard.\n[39] With respect, the number of cousins or nephews feared by the claimants is not a determinative factor in this case. Moreover, I am of the opinion that the alleged ground is not included in those set out in section 96 of the IRPA. Furthermore, it seems that the claimants did not establish, on a balance of probabilities, that they do not have a place to live should they return to the DRC. The testimony that the cousins and nephews would refuse to leave the refugee protection claimants' residence is pure speculation.\n[40] I add that I share the RPD's opinion that the addition, after the break, that the claimants fear that the cousins and nephews would physically attack them because he is married to a woman from another ethnic group is a significant factor. I am of the opinion that, if they fear problems because of an interethnic marriage, this fact should have been included in the BOC Form.\n[41] I have serious doubts regarding this fact, which was added after a break, considering that the claimants do not indicate in the BOC Form that they had had any problems because of this before they left the country and considering that the evidence on the record indicates that their family members had been living in their residences well before they left the DRC.\n[42] The RPD drew a negative inference from the fact that the male appellant indicates in the IMM-5669 form that he has been retired since XXXX 2006 whereas, at the hearing, he responded that he has not retired and is not receiving a pension because he had not worked long enough to receive retirement benefits.\n[43] I considered all the evidence and the arguments presented. I am of the opinion that this RPD finding is tenuous. However, it does not taint the decision rendered in any way.\nDelay in claiming refugee protection\n[44] Finally, although it is not determinative, the RPD also considered that the long delay in claiming refugee protection undermines their claims that their lives would be in danger.\n[45] The appellants submit that the RPD erred in considering this factor and that it failed to take into account [translation] \"that they held valid status and that they did not think that they consequently had to claim refugee protection.\"9\n[46] In Cruz, the Court states that \"delay is an important factor in the assessment of a refugee claim because it addresses the existence of a subjective fear of persecution which is an essential element of a convention refugee claim. A refugee claim should not be looked at simply as one of many choices as to how best to seek status in Canada.\"\n[47] Whereas the delay in claiming refugee protection is not itself a determinative factor regarding the validity of a refugee protection claim, it is, as the Court emphasizes, an important factor in the assessment of a subjective fear and may lead to serious doubt regarding the credibility of the allegations. (RAD's emphasis)\n[48] It should be noted that this factor was not determinative in rejecting their refugee protection claims. Indeed, the claimants have valid status in Canada. However, I am of the opinion that the particular circumstances of these refugee protection claims and their delay in filing a claim for protection lead to serious doubts as to the merits of their appeal.\nCONCLUSION\n[49] For these reasons, the RAD confirms the RPD's determination that XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX are not \"Convention refugees\" under section 96 of the IRPA or \"persons in need of protection\" within the meaning of section 97 of the IRPA.\n[50] The appeal is dismissed.\nMaria De Andrade\nMe Maria De Andrade\nAugust 8, 2016\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nN\u00b0 de dossier de la SAR \/ RAD File No.:MB5-04828 MB5-04829\nRAD.25.02 (2014.09.11)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\nRAD File No. \/ No de dossier de la SAR : MB5-04828; MB5-04829\n12\nRAD.25.02 (7 f\u00e9vrier 2014)\nAvailable in English\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] The Appellant, XXXX XXXX XXXX, alleges he is a citizen of Somalia. He is appealing a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) dated April 3, 2019, rejecting his claim for refugee protection.\n[2] For the following reasons, I dismiss this appeal.\nBACKGROUND OF APPEAL\nThe Appellant's claim, the RPD's decision, and the Appellant's arguments before the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD)\n[3] The Appellant alleged he is originally from Somalia and belongs to the XXXX or XXXX clan, a minority clan that suffered from discrimination and targeting, including torture and killing at the hands of majority clans. He fled with his mother to Kenya when the war broke out and alleged that they lived in the Dadaab refugee camp from 1992 onward.\n[4] After he returned to Somalia, he secretly married a woman from the majority Ogaden clan, a clan with a strong connection to Al-Shabaab. The Appellant alleged that on XXXX XXXX, 2015, a group of Ogaden men killed his father and elder brother in reprisal for his marriage to their clanswoman. The Appellant applied for refugee protection in Canada on August 3, 2016, alleging a fear of persecution from his alleged wife's family and also Al-Shabaab as a returnee from the West.\n[5] The RPD refused the Appellant's claim on the grounds of identity and credibility. The RPD accepted the Appellant was \"more likely than not [...] of Somali background and has spent periods of time in Somalia\", but found he had not established on a balance of probabilities that he was \"a national of Somalia at times material to the claim.\" It found further that the Appellant \"failed to adequately resolve significant allegations in areas foundational to the issue of [his] identity\". The RPD \"doubt[ed] the truthfulness of his testimony and other evidence.\"1\n[6] The Appellant submits he has established his identity on a balance of probabilities. He submits the RPD erred in accepting submissions from the Minister's Counsel that the Appellant's professed XXXX clan identity was undermined by his allegation that he belonged to a XXXX sub-clan, an allegation rebutted by country evidence before the RPD. He submits that, \"given the lack of knowledge about the XXXX clan\" and because \"[his] sub-clan is not documented in any of the limited evidence\", his testimony about his membership in a XXXX sub-clan should be given the benefit of the doubt.2\n[7] The Appellant also submits that the documents from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) show he \"did register at the Dagahaley refugee camp in Kenya in 1992\" and that this, along with his UNHCR case summary registration document, are strong evidence supporting his professed identity as a citizen of Somalia. He submits he should be given \"the benefit of the doubt [...] that he is a national of Somalia and a member of the minority XXXX clan.\"3\n[8] The Appellant alleges that he is a Somali citizen who faces a serious forward-looking risk of persecution in Somalia and that he is a Convention refugee.4\nNEW EVIDENCE\nNotice regarding any document or written submissions in light of the COVID-19 pandemic\n[9] On June 15, 2020, the Board provided Counsel with a notice related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This notice advised Counsel that they have 30 days from the date that they receive this notice to submit any document or written submissions in support of the appeal. They were also advised that any document or written submissions in support of the appeal will be accepted without an application and that the other requirements of Rule 29 and 110(4) continue to apply. Counsel has not submitted any document or written submissions in response to this notice.\nApplications under subsection 110(4) of the IRPA and RAD rule 29\n[10] As part of his RAD appeal record, the Appellant has asked me to admit a document entitled \"The XXXX XXXXof Southern Somalia and the Asylum Process\"5 as new evidence in this appeal in accordance with subsection 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\n[11] In a Rule 29 application dated July 23, 2020, the Appellant has also asked me to admit two additional documents as new evidence. The first is a supporting letter from Mr. XXXX XXXX XXXX dated June 1, 2019. The second is a letter from the XXXX XXXX XXXX of Toronto dated June 18, 2019.\n[12] By law,6 I can only accept as new evidence material that:\ni. arose after the RPD decision; or\nii. was not reasonably available at the time of the decision; or\niii. that you could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to bring to the RPD before the decision.\n[13] If the material meets one or more of these requirements, I must then decide if the material is new, credible and relevant before I can accept it as new evidence.7\nDecision on the application to admit new evidence\nApplication under IRPA ss. 110(4): \"XXXX XXXX XXXX of Southern Somalia and the Asylum Process\"\n[14] The Appellant's affidavit of June 26, 2019 states that the document should be accepted because its author \"states quite clearly that XXXX peoples have been refused asylum because of the clan he or she uses, which is not recognized by the court\", and because it supports his assertion that he \"belong[s] to the XXXX sub-clan of the XXXX, which both the Minister and the RPD Panel alleged did not exist.\"8 In his appeal memorandum, the Appellant submits the document \"should be accepted as new evidence as it was only located recently and rebuts a central issue in the RPD's decision, namely that the XXXX sub-clan of the XXXX does not exist.\"9\n[15] I have reviewed the document and its content suggests it post-dates item 13.5 in the current compilation of the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Somalia, which itself dates from the year 2000. As the document is undated, however, I am unable to ascertain with any certainty whether it meets the statutory requirements of subsection 110(4) of the IRPA. I therefore have no discretion to admit it into evidence in these proceedings. Consequently, the application to admit the document as new evidence is refused.\nRule 29 Application dated July 23, 2020\n[16] Under RAD sub-Rule 29(3), the subject of the appeal \"must include in an application to use a document that was not previously provided an explanation of how the document meets the requirements of subsection 110(4) of the [IRPA] and how that evidence relates to the person, unless the document is being presented in response to evidence presented by the Minister.\"\n[17] In his Rule 29 submissions, the Appellant's counsel writes that the two letters address the issue of the Appellant's identity and \"both confirm the Appellant's nationality and his clan affiliation\"10 in response to the issue of his identity which \"remains a significant issue in [his] claim\"11 and \"were only provided by the Appellant to [her] office recently\".12 Based on the foregoing, it is my independent assessment that the Appellant's Rule 29 application meets the requirements of sub-Rule 29(3).\n[18] Regarding the requirements of subsection 110(4) of the IRPA, I find both letters satisfy the statutory requirements of the subsection, as they both post-date the RPD's refusal of the Appellant's claim on February 23, 2019. The letters are prima facie credible, and while their content is not particularly novel, it is relevant to my determination of this appeal. I will therefore admit both documents into evidence.\nANALYSIS\n[19] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.13 I will apply the correctness standard of review after independently assessing the record in order to determine whether the RPD erred. I will only show deference to the RPD's credibility assessment and\/or to its weighing of the oral evidence in situations where the RPD enjoys a particular advantage. If I find the RPD had a particular advantage, my reasons will explain why.\n[20] My determination is based on my independent assessment of the evidence before me. This includes: the records prepared by the RPD and the Appellant; transcripts and audio recordings of both sittings of the Appellant's RPD hearings on February 23, 2018 and September 12, 2018; and documents contained in the current compilation of the NDP for Somalia.\nThe Appellant's UNHCR documents\n[21] The Appellant submits that the documents from the UNHCR14 that he disclosed to the RPD confirm that his name is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX states that 1991 is his year of birth, lists his nationality as Somali from Somalia, and identifies his place of birth as Kismayo in Somalia.15 The Appellant points to the fact that certain documents in the NDP for Somalia \"confirm that the XXXX population is found in Kismayo\" and on the Bajuni Islands \"off of the coast of the port city of Kismayo\" as establishing his identity as a Somali citizen.16 He also asserts the photo on the UNHCR case summary registration document in particular is readily identifiable as him.17\n[22] The RPD made no findings concerning the Appellant's UNHCR documents. Having examined those documents, I find they are insufficient to establish his identity as a national of Somalia on a balance of probabilities. First, the May 2018 letter from the UNHCR confirms only that a person with the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX was a resident in the Dadaab Refugee Camp in Dagahalay \"from 1992 until he spontaneously departed from the camp between February 2013 and July 2014.\"18\n[23] The letter states also that the named person's \"bio-data details were inactivated in UNHCR's database\" after he failed to attend the camp's \"population verification exercise [in] 2014.\"19 As a result, the bio-data stated in the UNHCR's Case Summary document cannot be verified with reference to the camp's most recent identity verification exercise in 2014. Finally, the photo included in the UNHCR case summary document is so difficult to make out that I cannot ascertain whether the person depicted in the photograph does resemble the photo of the Appellant included in the immigration intake documents in the RPD record.\n[24] In light of these findings, the fact that the UNHCR Case Summary document identifies the person depicted as \"XXXX\" is immaterial since, in my independent assessment, the Case Summary document is insufficient to establish the Appellant's personal identity, let alone his identity as a national of Somalia.\n[25] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the May 2008 letter from UNCHR Legal Officer XXXX XXXX, while instructive as to the status of the Appellant's registration with officials managing the Dadaab refugee camp, warrants little weight for the purpose of establishing the Appellant's personal and national identity. I find also that the UNHCR Case Summary document warrants no weight for this particular purpose.\nThe Appellant's professed XXXX clan identity\n[26] The Appellant's submissions concerning his professed XXXX identity are essentially that the evidence about the XXXX of Somalia is limited and internally inconsistent, and that in light of this, his testimony and other evidence about being XXXX should be given the benefit of the doubt and, in fact, preferred to the evidence on the XXXX in the NDP and other documents.\n[27] The RPD found the Appellant failed to establish his XXXX clan background, which was \"[a] central element of the [Appellant's] alleged fear of serious harm at the hands of [...] Al-Shabab and others in Somalia\".20\n[28] The RPD noted the Appellant's own counsel conceded the Appellant \"could not be expected to have more than minimal knowledge of the XXXX context\". Despite this, the RPD described the Appellant's testimony about the XXXX as \"basic\" and capable of being gained through \"a very basic archival and guided oral study of the XXXX\". The panel accepted the Minister's submission \"that the [Appellant's] XXXX sub clan is not listed as a sub clan of the XXXX.\" As well, the RPD \"reasonably [...] expected that after some five years of living and working with his brother and father in Kismayo\" the Appellant \"would be able to name at least one of the Bajuni islands in Somalia.\"21\n[29] Concerning the RPD's finding about the Appellant's knowledge of the Bajuni islands, my review of the transcript of the second sitting of the RPD hearing shows the Appellant identified one of the islands off Kismayo as \"Lamoo\".22 Although his counsel re-stated the Appellant's utterance as \"Lamalan\"23, in my independent assessment, the Appellant's testimony appears to refer to Lamu, a coastal community in Kenya.24\n[30] Later, when the RPD asked the Appellant to name some coastal areas where the XXXX live, the Appellant said he did not remember.25 I find the Appellant's testimony about the Bajuni islands does not support a finding that he belongs to Somalia's XXXX clan.\n[31] Concerning the Appellant's testimony about his membership in a sub-clan, during the hearing the Appellant testified that he belonged to the XXXX, XXXX or XXXX sub-clan of the XXXX. He was unable to say how many XXXX sub-clans there were, and explained it was because he \"grew up in a refugee camp\" and so only knew \"the sub clan of XXXX.\"26\n[32] In my independent assessment, the reliability of the Appellant's testimony about XXXX sub-clans is undermined by what he admitted was his lack of familiarity with the subject-matter. I reject, however, the Appellant's submission that it is \"entirely possible that the XXXX clan is a sub-clan of the XXXX\", not only because of the Appellant's unreliable testimony on the subject, but also because, as I explain below, this submission is not supported by the preponderance of the evidence - evidence which indicates that, on a balance of probabilities, the XXXX have no sub-clans.\n[33] In post-hearing written submissions,27 the Appellant's counsel critiqued the Minister's reliance on item 13.5 in the NDP for Somalia, the report of a joint fact-finding mission dating from the year 2000 on the XXXX of Somalia. In response, the Appellant's counsel disclosed a review of that report dating from June 2010 that disputes the original fact-finding mission report's findings concerning the XXXX XXXX Relying on the June 2010 review, the Appellant's counsel disputed the Minister's submission that the XXXX do not have sub-clans.\n[34] Having read this document, I give it no weight for the purpose for which it was disclosed by the Appellant's counsel to the RPD. While the written submissions state the document is \"from Memorial University\", the document's authorship is not attributed to an individual or group of individuals. My several attempts to access the document using the hyperlink given on its first page were unsuccessful. I therefore have no way of knowing who authored the report, which frustrates my efforts to determine its reliability.\n[35] In short, the NDP is part of the record for the benefit of the Board and claimants in every single hearing; it is widely accepted, and known, and the content of the NDP's sources for country of origin information are reliable in the absence of evidence to the contrary. By contrast, the Appellant has not established with credible and trustworthy evidence that item 13.5 is from an unreliable source.\n[36] Item 13.5 says a UNHCR genealogical table describes the XXXX \"as a XXXX sub-clan\", but that the fact-finding mission's delegate \"did not [...] receive information from any other source that indicated that this was the case.\"28 Item 13.5 does not indicate the XXXX have any sub-clans.29\n[37] Concerning their links to other clans in Somalia, a December 2009 report from the Austrian Red Cross Society, also included in the current NDP compilation for Somalia, describes the XXXX as not a clan but rather as a minority of Arabic descent.30 An August 2017 report from the Danish Demining Group describes the XXXX as \"culturally and linguistically distinct from Somalis, and [...] no part of a Somali lineage.\"31\n[38] In my independent assessment, the evidence does not support a finding that the RPD erred in relying on item 13.5 to assess the Appellant's testimony about his membership in a XXXX sub-clan. I reject paragraphs 16 to 25 of the Appellant's written submissions on this subject.\n[39] I turn now to the two letters disclosed in the Appellant's Rule 29 application. First, the June 1, 2019 letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX states that he met the Appellant in Kenya in 2001 while visiting relatives in the Dadaab refugee camp, and that he knows the Appellant's \"half sister XXXX XXXX XXXX and [...] was close friend[s] to her when [they] were together in Mombasa or Dadab refugee camp.\"32\n[40] While I accept that Mr. XXXX was not aware the Appellant was in Toronto until April 2019, after the RPD refused the latter's claim, I find Mr. XXXX letter does not offer any information that supports a finding that the Appellant is XXXX. The letter states simply that MR. XXXX had a \"good relationship\" with the Appellant, but says nothing about the frequency and nature of their interactions in Kenya.\n[41] The June 18, 2019 letter from Mr. XXXX XXXX of the the XXXX XXXX XXXX of Toronto asserts that the Appellant is a Somali citizen and a XXXX person based on an interview conducted \"[o]n February, 2019\". Mr. XXXX states he asked the Appellant about \"his background, places that he resided, people that he may have known, the history of XXXX, the geography of the coastal areas as well as the familiarity of Somalia in general\".33 The letter fails, however, to summarize the Appellant's answers, beyond stating that he explained \"the history of the coastal areas and the history of [the] XXXX people\".34 This is knowledge that, in my opinion, could be acquired by reading objective sources.\n[42] Moreover, the letter states the Appellant's fear was based on \"the Somali civil war and Shabaab subjugations in particular\"35 and does not mention the Appellant's main allegation, that his father and brother were killed by members of the majority Ogaden clan in reprisal for the Appellant's relationship with a woman of that clan. In short, the letter's account of the Appellant's subjective fear of persecution varies significantly from the subjective fear articulated by the Appellant himself across his various Basis of Claim (BOC) forms and affidavits.\n[43] It is my independent assessment that both letters, taken individually and cumulatively, are insufficient to remedy the serious credibility issues undermining the Appellant's testimony and other evidence about his personal and ethno-cultural identity. I give both letters no weight for the purpose of establishing either the Appellant's XXXX ethno-cultural identity or his identity as a citizen of Somalia.\nThe RPD's other findings\n[44] The RPD's negative determination did not focus exclusively on the Appellant's evidence about his sub-clan membership and his knowledge of the islands near and south of Kismayo, identified in the NDP documents as the traditional homeland of the XXXX XXXX The RPD also found:\n1. That discrepancies between the Appellant's evidence and that of his identity witness, XXXX XXXX XXXX, were not adequately resolved;\n2. That the affidavit of the Appellant's mother was inconsistent with the Appellant's testimony about when his elder brother and father died;\n3. That the affidavit of the Appellant's spouse was inconsistent with the Appellant's testimony about when key events at the heart of his claim allegedly took place;36\n4. That the Appellant's evidence failed to establish that he was married;37\n5. That the events and incidents the Appellant alleged in his refugee claim in Norway contradicted the allegations in his amended BOC narrative;38 and\n6. That the psychotherapist's report warranted little weight.39\n[45] I have examined these findings and in my independent assessment the RPD did not err in making any of these findings.\n[46] First, the RPD referenced inconsistencies between the Appellant's oral testimony and the testimony of the identity witness identified by the Minister in his written submissions of October 26, 2018.40 Although the RPD did not make an explicit negative credibility finding, having reviewed the transcript, I find the RPD did not err in relying on the inconsistencies identified in the Minister's written submissions, which are supported by my review of the transcript.\n[47] For example, the Minister's counsel wrote: that the Appellant's identity witness \"knew only superficial information about the [Appellant's] family\" and gave limited testimony about the Appellant's father's XXXX XXXX; and that the witness's testimony that he was \"a XXXX XXXX in Guelph\" contradicted the Appellant's testimony that the witness \"worked at a XXXX in Kitchener\".41\n[48] My review of the transcript of the first sitting of the hearing bears out the Minister's counsel's written submissions regarding inconsistencies between the testimony of the Appellant and his identity witness about the Appellant's father's XXXX XXXX42 and the witness's work situation.43\n[49] Concerning the Appellant's family, the witness testified he never met the Appellant's mother, and that he only knew the Appellant's mother was in Kenya because the Appellant told him so, and that he didn't know when she went to Kenya.44 Although the witness testified he knew how many siblings the Appellant had, he was able to identify only the Appellant's late father and brother by name, and did not know the Appellant's father's full name.45\n[50] In my independent assessment, however, the following exchange between the Appellant's identity witness and the RPD panel is most instructive:\nRPD PANEL:\nDo you have any independent knowledge of his background and story other than what he has told you?\nWITNESS:\nNo, I only know what he told me.46\n[51] The fact that the identity witness's testimony was entirely informed by the Appellant, calls into question the reliability of the witness's testimony, given the problems with the Appellant's credibility. In my independent assessment, the RPD did not err in finding the witness's testimony was inadequate to establish not only the Appellant's personal identity, but also his identity as a national of Somalia.\n[52] Second, the affidavit of the Appellant's mother states that her first spouse and their son XXXX were killed in Kismayo in June 2015.47 Third, the affidavit of the Appellant's spouse states that his father and his brother XXXX \"were killed by [her] family and [her] tribe members [in] June 2015\".48\n[53] While the content of both affidavits is consistent with statements made in the Appellant's BOC form of August 201649 and with this first amendment to his BOC narrative dated April 2016,50 it is inconsistent with his second amended BOC form of February 2018, which states that he left Somalia for Ethiopia on XXXX XXXX, 2014, immediately after members of the Ogaden clan killed his brother and father.51\n[54] When the Minister's counsel asked the Appellant about the inconsistency in his evidence and his mother's affidavit, the Appellant testified he told her to write it down June 2015 \"because [he] was afraid that if [he] mentioned that [he had been in] Norway that [he] would be deported back.\"52\n[55] In my independent assessment, the Appellant's overall credibility is undermined by his admission that he directed the content of his mother's affidavit in an attempt to mislead the RPD's assessment of his claim.\n[56] The Minister's counsel also asked the Appellant about the inconsistency between his evidence and his spouse's affidavit:\nMINISTER'S COUNSEL:\nSo in your wife's affidavit where she mentions that you were kidnapped and arrested in March 2015 and held for three months and that your father and brother were killed in June 2015, why is she giving dates in 2015 (inaudible) 2014?\nCLAIMANT:\nBecause of fear that I had from the United States, I never told the true story about when I left the country.\nMINISTER'S COUNSEL:\nOkay. That's all well and good, why is she saying that in her affidavit as to what happened?\nCLAIMANT:\nBecause when I left Norway and came to the United States that's exactly I told her, but because of fear.\nMINISTER'S COUNSEL:\nSo she is willing to make untrue statements to support your claim?\nCLAIMANT:\nWhen I was coming here for the court I was told to bring my right case and right information and that's why I'm here to tell the truth today.\nMINISTER'S COUNSEL:\nWhat do you mean you were told to bring the right case and right information?\nCLAIMANT:\nI said I was in Norway the first time.53\n[57] While I accept the Appellant's testimony that he was motivated to tell the truth before the RPD, I note that the affidavit of the Appellant's spouse was part of a package of documents disclosed to the RPD on September 15, 2016, and post-dates not only the determination of his refugee claim in Norway in XXXX 201554 and his order of removal from the United States of America on XXXX XXXX, 201655 (which followed the refusal of his asylum claim in that country on XXXX XXXX, 201556), but also his entry to Canada on XXXX XXXX, 201657 when he initiated his refugee claim.\n[58] Despite this, the Appellant did not disclose that he had directed his spouse to give content in her affidavit that could be viewed as intentionally misleading until the Minister's counsel raised the inconsistency during the second sitting of his hearing, just over two years after he disclosed the affidavit to the RPD.\n[59] In my independent assessment, the Appellant's explanations to the Minister's counsel cannot justify the inconsistencies between the affidavits of his mother and spouse and his other evidence concerning the alleged date of his father and brother's deaths. The Appellant's overall credibility is severely undermined by these inconsistencies. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the deaths of the Appellant's father and brother never, in fact, took place.\n[60] Fourth, I have reviewed the copy of the marriage certificate58 the Appellant disclosed to the RPD and I note the discrepancy between the title of the official translation of the certificate and the stamp as described by the RPD panel.59 When the Appellant was asked about this discrepancy, he was unable to explain it.60\n[61] The Appellant was also questioned generally about his marriage and testified that he and his spouse married in Kismayo in XXXX 2014.61 When the RPD panel asked the Appellant why that testimony contradicted the marriage dates given in his original and amended BOC narratives, which state that he first met his spouse in June 2014,62 he responded that they first met in 2013 and were secretly engaged in February 2014.63 In my independent assessment, his answer is inadequate to explain why he gave a different marriage date in two different BOC narratives.\n[62] A little later, when the Minister's counsel also pointed out to the Appellant that the marriage certificate he disclosed to the RPD stated he was married in XXXX 2015, the Appellant suggested that the date on the certificate was the result of an error in translation.64 In my independent assessment, it is more likely that the marriage certificate was crafted to corroborate the marriage date given in the affidavit of the Appellant's spouse, given that both items were disclosed to the RPD September 15, 2016 in the same package of documents.\n[63] I draw a negative inference concerning the Appellant's credibility overall, given the various dates given for his marriage in his evidence. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant was never married.\n[64] Fifth, the RPD accepted the decision of the Immigration Appeals Board (UNE) in Norway that refused the Appellant's refugee claim, but placed no weight on the Norwegian documents themselves.65\n[65] The RPD's decision remarks that the Appellant \"continued to maintain lies in areas substantially material to his claim right until the first sitting of his Canadian claim in February 2018 when he acknowledged that he had sought protection in Norway\".66 This is borne out by the transcript of the first sitting of the hearing,67 which shows that the Appellant withheld this information from his own counsel until the Minister proposed to examine him with reference to the Minister's correspondence with immigration authorities in Norway.68\n[66] As well, my examination of the documents from the Appellant's Norwegian refugee claim show he alleged a risk of persecution to authorities in Norway based on facts entirely different from those he alleged before the RPD:\nThe refugee interview was carried out on 05.02.2015. [The Norwegian refugee appeal tribunal] repeats the appellant's explanation of why he left his homeland on page 4 of the decision of 07.05.2015 as follows:\nThe applicant feared to be killed by al-Shabaab on his return to Dadaab. The applicant grew up in Dadaab, after he fled with his family from Kismayo in 1991. Al-Shabaab killed the applicant's stepfather after the applicant left Dadaab. Representatives from al-Shabaab were critical of the applicant's work in the refugee camp, and when he did not follow their demand to quit, the applicant feared that Al-Shabaab would kill him if given the opportunity.\nThe applicant furthermore explained that he cannot travel to Somalia because he does not know Somalia, and he has no house there.69\n[67] While some elements presented in his RPD and RAD claim are present in the allegations he made to the Norwegian tribunal, the Appellant's amended BOC narrative of February 201870 does not mention he was targeted by Al-Shabaab in Dadaab camp for his work with the NRC [Norwegian Refugee Council] during the period of January 2010 to December 2010, and for another organization from January 2011 to 31 February 2014, as he alleged to Norway's UNE in his claim.71\n[68] Moreover, given the numerous inconsistencies in the Appellant's evidence about when his father and brother were allegedly killed, his marriage to his spouse, and when he was in Kismayo, there is simply no reliable or objective information against which I can test his testimony that the general allegations at the heart of his claim in Norway were \"correct\"72 - not least of all because some key elements of his claim before the RPD are nowhere to be found in the documents from his Norwegian refugee claim.\n[69] It is my independent assessment that the Appellant's failure to disclose his refugee claim in Norway to the RPD until the start of his oral hearing seriously undermines his overall credibility as a witness, as it indicates a willingness on his part to withhold material information from decision-makers even when that information is relevant to the proper adjudication of his claim. Moreover, the inconsistencies between the allegations behind that claim and the allegations of risk submitted to the RPD further undermine his credibility as a witness. I draw a negative credibility inference from these inconsistencies, which impact matters relevant to the heart of the Appellant's claim.\n[70] Sixth, the RPD gave little weight to the assessment report prepared by the Appellant's psychotherapist. It found the report's methodology was unclear and that the report failed to \"set out to what extent the [Appellant's] own personal reporting of his experience\" was \"taken into account in the overall psychotherapeutic assessment and report.\"73\n[71] Having examined the report, I do not agree with the RPD that the psychotherapist's clinical methodology is unclear. The \"Approach to Assessment\" section of the report does set out Ms. XXXX methodological approach in assessing her clients.74 Moreover, the assessment was based on an hour-long interview with the Appellant and Ms. XXXX does note that the information in the report was \"provided by Mr. XXXX.\"75\n[72] I have two further concerns: first, the RPD's Reasons for Decision fail to properly acknowledge the clinical opinion in the Appellant's psychotherapy assessment report, and its finding that symptoms Ms. XXXX observed in the Appellant were consistent with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.76 Instead, the RPD's Reasons characterize the report as \"a medico-legal document produced for the purposes of supporting [his] refugee claim\".77\n[73] In my opinion, this is not a valid basis upon which to dismiss the report: the disclosure of psycho-social, psycho-therapeutic and psychiatric assessments to decision-makers in the RPD is common practice and the mere fact the Appellant did so in support of his own claim and by way of explaining challenges that he might face in testifying does not constitute an abuse of the Board's process.\n[74] My second concern arises from the RPD's decision to weigh the report based on what it refers to as \"the [Appellant's conduct in relationship to the psychotherapist's recommendations\". The RPD observed in its Reasons that while \"[s]everal potential therapies [were] recommended to the [Appellant] to address symptoms he reported to the psychotherapist\" he \"had not followed those recommendations [as of] the date of the proceeding\" and \"testified that he looks after himself.\"78\n[75] In my independent assessment, it was not open to the RPD to draw a negative credibility inference from the Appellant's failure to continue with the course of treatment suggested by the psychotherapist.\n[76] My review of the transcripts of both sittings of the hearing indicates the Appellant might not have been aware of the recommendation in the psychotherapist report that he undergo further counselling, as he did not respond directly to questions put to him by the Minister's counsel on that issue.79\n[77] More importantly, however, the Appellant's ability to pursue the recommended treatment could have been affected by one or a combination of any number of factors extraneous to the issues at the heart of his claim. Absent clear evidence from the Appellant that he knew of the psychotherapist's recommendation that he seek further treatment and ignored it for reasons related to any of the credibility issues at the heart of his claim, I find it was not open to the RPD to draw a negative credibility inference from the Appellant's failure to seek further psychotherapeutic treatment, as this finding unfairly effectively imputed to him a rationale for failing to comply with the psychotherapist's recommendation for which there was simply no basis in the evidence.\n[78] That being said, however, I do agree with the RPD's decision to give the report \"very little weight\" for the specific purpose of supporting the \"core allegations\" in the Appellant's claim, given that the information in the \"History Relevant to Assessment\" section of the report80 is inconsistent with most of the other evidence the Appellant provided about material aspects of his claim, including (but not limited to): when he allegedly met his wife; when the two of them were secretly married; when his father and brother were allegedly murdered; and when he left Somalia. Critically, this section of the report does not mention the Appellant's time in Norway between XXXX 2014 and XXXX 2015.\n[79] In light of the foregoing, I find the Appellant failed to establish his personal identity or his identity as a national of Somalia with acceptable evidence, and in particular, that his testimony was altogether lacking in credibility, which undermined his overall credibility as a witness. In my opinion, the RPD did not err in refusing the Appellant's claim on the grounds of identity and credibility.\n[80] I therefore dismiss this appeal.\nCONCLUSION\n[81] The RAD dismisses the appeal and confirms the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection, pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the IRPA.\n(signed)\nS.

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is the adult daughter of the Principal Appellant (collectively, the Appellants). They are citizens of Nigeria.\n[2] The Appellants appeal a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) denying their refugee claims. As preliminary issues, the Appellants are asking the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) to allow new evidence and to hold a hearing. On the merits of their appeal, they submit that the RPD erred by finding 1) they should have approached the Nigerian police for state protection, and 2) they have an internal flight alternative (IFA) in Lagos.\n[3] For the reasons that follow, I will allow the Appellants' new evidence, but I deny their request for an oral hearing. Contrary to the RPD, I do not find the Appellants had to approach the police in order to rebut the presumption of state protection in Nigeria. Nevertheless, I find there is a viable IFA for the Appellants in Port Harcourt. Therefore, I confirm the RPD decision, but for different reasons, and deny the appeal.\nBACKGROUND\n[4] The Appellants claim that if they return to Nigeria they will be persecuted or harmed for two reasons. First, their husband\/father, who worked as a customs official, successfully enforced the law against various smugglers. After receiving several threatening anonymous phone calls, the Appellants believe these smugglers want to exact revenge by harming them. Second, they claim that if they return to Nigeria, the family of their husband\/father will force them to undergo female genital mutilation (FGM).\n[5] The RPD canvassed Port Harcourt as a possible IFA, but no reasons were provided regarding this location. Therefore, the RAD sent a notice to the Appellants on November 29, 2018 seeking additional submissions on an IFA in Port Harcourt.1 Those submissions were received on December 12, 2018.2\nANALYSIS\nPreliminary Issue 1: Admissibility of New Evidence\n[6] New evidence will only be admitted on appeal where that evidence: 1) arose after the rejection of the claim by the RPD; 2) was not reasonably available; or 3) the appellant could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented the evidence, at the time of the rejection.3 The RAD has no discretion to admit new evidence unless it falls under one of these three categories.4\n[7] If the new evidence meets the above requirements, I must then assess whether the new evidence is credible, relevant, and new.5\n[8] The Appellants ask the RAD to allow a newspaper article, dated November 12, 2017, entitled \"International body rates Nigeria Police worst globally\". They submit that, as the RPD decision is dated October 25, 2017, the article arose after the RPD's rejection of the claim. They also argue that it is relevant to the issue of state protection.\n[9] I agree with the Appellants submissions. Furthermore, having considered the source and circumstances of the article, I find no reason to doubt its credibility. As well, the article is new in the sense that it is capable of proving the current state of affairs in Nigeria. For these reasons, I find the article is admissible as new evidence.\nPreliminary Issue 2: Request for an Oral Hearing\n[10] I may hold an oral hearing only if the new evidence presented on appeal raises a serious issue with respect to the credibility of the Appellants; is central to the decision with respect to the refugee claim; and, if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the refugee claim.6\n[11] In the present case, I do not find the new evidence raises a serious issue with respect to the Appellants' credibility. It speaks to the country conditions relevant to the adequacy of state protection, but not to the determinative issue of an IFA in Port Harcourt. As two of the conditions for holding a hearing have not been met, I deny the request to hold an oral hearing.\nScope of the RAD Review\n[12] The determinative issues on appeal are: 1) did the RPD err in assessing state protection in Nigeria, and 2) do the Appellants have an IFA in Port Harcourt?\n[13] When reviewing the RPD decision, I am required to independently determine whether the RPD was correct in relation to each alleged error of law, fact, or mixed fact and law. I may defer to the RPD's credibility assessment of oral testimony, if I find that the RPD had a meaningful advantage in the circumstances.7 Credibility is not at issue in the present case, therefore, no deference is warranted.\nThe RPD Erred in Assessing State Protection in Nigeria\n[14] The law presumes that states can and will protect their citizens.8 Therefore, refugee claimants have the burden of showing, on balance, that the country they are fleeing is unwilling or unable to protect them.9 A refugee claim can be denied if claimants do not first try to access state protection in their country, unless they can demonstrate that it would have been objectively unreasonable to do so.10\n[15] In the present case, the Principal Appellant did not go to the police about the threatening calls her husband received. The RPD found, where protection may reasonably have been forthcoming,11 the Appellants' failure to approach the state for protection defeated their claim as it related to the threats from the anonymous callers.12 After looking at the \"voluminous evidence\" in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Nigeria,13 the RPD landed on the following summary statement in the UK Home Office report: \"In general a person will be able to access state protection against the persecution or serious harm from non-state actors... but this will depend on the particular facts of their case and the profile of the person\".14\n[16] I agree with the Appellants that the RPD failed to adequately address evidence contradicting its finding that state protection would be \"reasonably forthcoming\". Several sources indicate that, irrespective of the nature of the complaint, the Nigerian police is deeply corrupt15 and ineffective.16 Lack of accountability, human rights abuses, and impunity are repeatedly stated as major flaws in the Nigerian criminal justice system.17 The United Nations Special Rapporteur on Minority Issues summarizes the situation as follows: \"A culture of impunity has extremely pernicious effects; investigations are not undertaken or poorly managed, prosecutions are not initiated or pursued, victims are left defenceless, the role of security forces is negatively perceived and, in many cases, people decide to take the law into their own hands.\"18\n[17] I find the new evidence further supports, objectively, the Principal Appellant's belief that complaining to the Nigerian police would be futile.19 The World Internal Security and Police Index, released in 2017, ranks Nigeria as the worst police organization in the world. After assessing 127 countries on their capacity, processes, legitimacy, and outcomes, the International Police Science Association and the Institute for Economic and Peace concluded that Nigeria is the worst in terms of its ability to handle internal security challenges.\n[18] As I find the RPD's state protection analysis was made in error, I am exercising my remedial authority to confirm the RPD decision for different reasons.20 While I find that the Appellants were not required to seek state protection in relation to the phone threats they received while living in Lagos, I nevertheless find there is an IFA for the Appellants in Port Harcourt.\nThe Appellants have an IFA in Port Harcourt\n[19] The test for an IFA is two-pronged. Once the IFA has been raised, the onus is on the claimant to establish: 1) on a balance of probabilities, there is a serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the suggested IFA location; and 2) it is objectively unreasonable or unduly harsh, in all of the circumstances, for the claimant to move to the suggested IFA location.21\n[20] At the hearing, the RPD explored Lagos and Port Harcourt as possible IFAs, but only provided reasons for Lagos as an IFA in relation to the Appellants' risk of FGM and other rituals. Based on my independent review, I believe the IFA analysis also extends to the risk of harm arising from the threatening phone calls. However, as the latter risk was experienced in Lagos, the better IFA to explore is Port Harcourt.\n[21] The Chairperson of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada has designated a Jurisprudential Guide (JG) on the issue of IFA in Nigeria for persons fleeing non-state actors.22 I find the JG has facts similar to the Appellants case so that is should be followed.\n[22] I have also applied the Gender Guidelines in determining the Appellants' recourse to an IFA, considering the ability of women, because of their gender, to travel safely to the IFA and to stay there without facing undue hardship. I have taken into account religious, economic, and cultural factors, and how these factors affect women in the IFA.23\nThere is no serious possibility of the Appellants being harmed by smugglers in Port Harcourt\n[23] The Appellants submits that Port Harcourt is not a viable IFA because the city is along the same axis where their husband\/father operated his anti-smuggling campaign. Therefore, according to the Appellants, there is a reasonable prospect that the smugglers will track them there and harm them.24\n[24] The population of Nigeria is over 186 million, and the population of Port Harcourt, as the fifth largest city, is 2.343 million.25 Port Harcourt is approximately 336 km from the village in Edo State where the Appellants were living before leaving for Canada26 (approximately 6-7 hours driving distance), and approximately 606 kms from Ikeja, Lagos State where the Appellants lived when they received the anonymous phone calls (approximately 8 hours driving distance).27 The documentary evidence indicates that there is poor infrastructure and communications networks in Nigeria, which would impede the agents of persecution from locating them in Port Harcourt.28\n[25] Based on the above the evidence, I find there is less than a mere possibility that the Appellant would be found if they relocated to Port Harcourt.29 I find there is insufficient evidence to objectively support the Principal Appellant's belief that the smugglers have the reach or authority to track them in Port Harcourt.30 Evidence of anonymous phone calls received in Lagos State, where the callers simply state that they know where the Appellants live and they know the police, does not demonstrate that they actually or concretely have the means to track the Appellants anywhere in Nigeria.31 I note that the Principal Appellant's husband received these phone calls after his retirement in late March 2016, however, there is no evidence that anyone approached the Appellants at their home in Ikeja in the nine months thereafter, or in the village they moved to after December 2016. In other words, there is no evidence that the callers actually knew where they lived. It is vague and speculative that there is a reasonable prospect the smugglers will track them in Port Harcourt and harm them.\n[26] There is no evidence that the threatening calls continued after the Appellants moved to the village in Edo State, or that there are on-going threats against the Principal Appellant's husband, even though he remains in Nigeria. The Principal Appellant speculated that calls and threats may have continued, but her husband did not tell her because he did not want to upset her. This is insufficient. If there is evidence of on-going threats, I would have expected the Principal Appellant to ask her husband to provide this information to support her refugee claim where her life and the life of her children are at stake.\n[27] There is also no evidence that the Principal Appellant's husband changed his phone number in order to stop the threatening calls. The Principal Appellant explained that it is not easy to change his phone number because it is connected to his bank accounts and \"so many other things\". Where the Appellants are claiming to fear for their life, such an inconvenience is inconsequential in the grander scheme of the alleged risk of harm.\nThere is no serious possibility of the Appellants being harmed by the Principal Appellant's in-laws in Port Harcourt\n[28] The Appellants made no submissions specific to the threat of FGM in the IFA, except to say there is no state protection.32\n[29] I have listened to the testimony before the RPD and independently reviewed the record. For the reasons set out in the RPD decision, I find the Appellants do not face a serious possibility of persecution by family members in Port Harcourt.33 The RPD's reasons are correct. While the RPD's reasons discuss Lagos as an IFA, the same reasoning applies to Port Harcourt. That is, while living in other parts of Nigeria outside of Edo State, there is no evidence that the Principal Appellant's in-laws were motivated to pursue the Appellants in order to carry out harmful procedures. The in-laws have not sought out the Appellants after missing a deadline of July 2017 in order to have FGM performed on them, and they are unaware of the Appellants' whereabouts.\n[30] Furthermore, the documentary evidence indicates that, generally, where both parents refuse to comply with a family request for FGM, the decision is left to the parents.34 The evidence states that \"no one will walk into someone else's home to perform FGM on their daughters\" if the parents are refusing.35 In the present case, both the Principal Appellant and her husband have refused to have their children subjected to FGM, and the husband's family have not demonstrated a desire to pursue the Appellants outside of their village.36\n[31] I find the Appellants provided insufficient objective evidence demonstrating that the family of the Principal Appellant's husband have the means or capacity to find them in Port Harcourt, or the motivation to force the Appellants to undergo FGM in Port Harcourt.\n[32] Where there is no serious possibility of persecution in the IFA, as in the present case, there is nothing in the jurisprudence to suggest that state protection in the IFA is necessary.\nIt is objectively reasonable for the Appellants to relocate to Port Harcourt\n[33] The Appellants have the onus of proving that the IFA is not objectively reasonable.37 The Federal Court of Appeal set a very high threshold for what makes an IFA unreasonable: \"It requires nothing less than the existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant in travelling or temporarily relocating to a safe area. In addition, it requires actual and concrete evidence of such conditions.\"38\n[34] The Appellants submit it would be unreasonable for them to relocate to Port Harcourt because of high rents; problems for single mothers to find housing; discrimination against ethnic groups not indigenous to the area; high unemployment rates and poor working conditions for women; the prevalence of violence for women who head their own households without male or family support; and the risk of kidnapping based on the profile of \"perceived wealth\".39\n[35] While the documentary evidence notes that women face considerable economic discrimination in Nigeria, it also notes that women who are educated and who have a higher social status are more likely to gain employment, and that ethnicity is less of a factor or obtaining work in the South than it is in the North.40 Where a claimant has achieved post-secondary education or meaningful work experience, they may be in a better position in terms of securing employment, where such opportunities exist, than the average Nigerian.41 The personal circumstances of any particular claimant may make housing more or less viable where they are able to access support of family or other social networks in the IFA. Challenges for obtaining housing are more pronounced for female-headed households without male support.42\n[36] Based on the above principles, I have assessed the reasonableness of Port Harcourt as an IFA based on the following profile of the Principal Appellant. She has post-secondary education in nursing and completed a course of study at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.43 She has approximately 22 years of work experience as a XXXX and midwife. Her husband obtained a Master' degree from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.44 He is a retired XXXX XXXX XXXX. He previously worked with the XXXX XXXX XXXX, requiring him to live away from his family for several periods of time. He also worked in Port Harcourt from 1996-1999.45 At the time of the hearing, he was processing his pension entitlements. He also ran a family business in XXXX XXXX XXXX.46\n[37] While there is no evidence that the Principal Appellant's husband is unable or unwilling to move to Port Harcourt, thereby distinguishing her profile from the single women described in the evidence relied upon by her, I note that she and her children previously lived for several years, often apart from her husband, in both Lagos and Port Harcourt. Significantly, the Principal Appellant lived and worked in Port Harcourt for approximately eight years, from 1998 - 2006.47 There is no evidence that she experienced the difficulties that she is now claiming she will face if she relocates there. Furthermore, I note that all three of the minor Appellants were born in Port Harcourt and lived there without incidence.\n[38] Finally, I do not find the country condition documents about the prevalence of kidnappings in Port Harcourt48 constitute concrete evidence of their life or safety being jeopardized.49 Their assertion that they will be perceived as wealthy, having returned from overseas, and targeted for kidnapping, is unsupported by any evidence. They fail to explain how people will know they have just returned from overseas. The risk of kidnapping now asserted is no different from their past circumstances while living in Port Harcourt, given that they claim that it is their wealth that makes them vulnerable.50 There is no evidence placing them at risk higher than that of other Nigerians.51\n[39] Based on the Appellants' profile and circumstances, I do not find it would be unduly harsh or unreasonable for them to relocate to Port Harcourt.\nCONCLUSION\n[40] I find there is an IFA for the Appellants in Port Harcourt. Pursuant to ss. 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, I confirm the decision of the RPD, but for different reasons, that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n[41] The appeal is dismissed.\n(signed)\n\"Veena Verma\"\nVeena Verma\nDecember 31, 2018\nDate\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD File \/ Dossier de la SAR : TB7-25265\nTB7-25266 \/ TB7-25267 \/ TB7-25268\n2\nRAD.25.02 (July 05, 2018)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n",

The Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) received their notice of appeal on March 27, 2015. Their appeal record with the application for an extension of time to file or perfect an appeal was received on March 26, 2015.\n[2] Subsection 159.91(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, as amended, states that the time limit for a person or the Minister to file an appeal against a decision of the RPD is fifteen (15) days after the day on which the written reasons for the RPD's decision are received, and the time limit to perfect such an appeal is thirty (30) days following receipt of the written reasons for decision. Therefore, the appellants' appeal was to be perfected no later than February 25, 2015.\n[3] The appellants submitted an application for an extension of time to file or perfect an appeal, which the RAD received on March 26, 2015. The appellants' notice of appeal was submitted thirty (30) days after the deadline, and the appellants' record was submitted twenty-nine (29) days late. In the application for an extension of time to file or perfect an appeal that was attached to the application, the law firm representing the appellants explains that the record was submitted late because the appellants' counsel decided to request a transcript of the hearing and because she was on vacation during the first week of March.\n[4] The Minister did not respond to this application, but submitted a notice of intervention on April 15, 2015.\nDETERMINATION ON THE APPLICATION\n[5] The RAD allows the application for an extension of time to file or perfect this appeal.\nApplication for extension of time\n[6] Subsection 159.91(2) of the Regulations states:\nIf the appeal cannot be filed within the time limit set out in paragraph 1)(a) or perfected within the time limit set out in paragraph 1)(b), the Refugee Appeal Division may, for reasons of fairness and natural justice, extend each of those time limits by the number of days that is necessary in the circumstances.\n[7] Three requirements arise from these provisions. First of all, it was not possible to file or perfect the appeal within the prescribed time limits. Appellants must be able to provide an explanation to justify the delay and demonstrate their continuing intention to pursue the matter during that time. Subrule 37(4) of the Refugee Appeal Division Rules requires that any evidence must be given in an affidavit or statutory declaration. Secondly, the extension cannot exceed the number of days that are necessary in the circumstances. This implies that the extension granted must be as brief as possible or, in other words, that each additional day of extension granted must be justified. The term \"circumstances\" implies an individual assessment of the circumstances in each case where an extension is requested. Thirdly, the extension must be granted for reasons of fairness and natural justice. The case law has established four factors that must be considered for all applications for an extension of time submitted before the courts or administrative tribunals.1 These factors are:\na) there was and is a continuing intention on the part of the party presenting the motion to pursue the appeal;\nb) the subject matter of the appeal discloses an arguable case;\nc) there is a reasonable explanation for the defaulting party's delay; and\nd) there is no prejudice to the other party in allowing the extension.\nCONCLUSION\n[8] In this case, the appellants submitted their notice of appeal thirty (30) days after the deadline, and their appellants' record twenty-nine (29) days late. The time limit for filing and perfecting the appeal was extended because, in this case, the appellants hired their counsel in a timely fashion, which demonstrates their continuing intention to pursue the appeal. The grounds of appeal reveal an arguable case. The Minister did not object to this application. The lawyer's arguments are reasonable: a transcript was deemed necessary in this case; she had to wait for her legal aid mandate before being authorized to request the recordings; there was a technical problem. The record is deemed to have been perfected on April 22, 2015.\nDiane Sokolyk\nMe Diane Sokolyk\nApril 22, 2015\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD File No. \/ No de dossier de la SAR : MB5-00436\nMB5-00437\n2\nRAD.25.02 (2014.09.11)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is a citizen of Colombia and of Italy. He and his family were extorted for many years by one of the paramilitary groups in Colombia due to their XXXX XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX businesses. He was threatened by a second paramilitary group when he took over the family businesses. His claim was denied by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) due to insufficient evidence regarding any risks or dangers in his second country of citizenship, Italy. I agree that this is the determinative issue.\n[2] The Appellant does not present new evidence nor seek an oral hearing.\nDECISION\n[3] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nANALYSIS\n[4] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.1 The Appellant does not contest the RPD's statement of facts. Having reviewed the Basis of Claim, the transcript and the supporting evidence, I adopt the RPD's statement of facts.2\n[5] The Appellant does not contest the RPD's findings about the likelihood of persecution or of risk of danger or harm in Colombia. For that reason, I have focussed my analysis on Italy.\n[6] The Appellant argues that he will be targeted in Italy as a foreigner. He points to country condition evidence of discrimination based on race or ethnicity. This discrimination has resulted in hate-based attacks, discrimination in employment, religious hatred and xenophobia. The Appellant notes that there is a lack of adequate legal measures as well as insufficient resources to government bodies which protect or intervene in these matters. He asserts \"that this treatment is extended to him as he is not considered an 'original Italian' by the society\".3 With respect to the Appellant who has never been to Italy, this statement is speculative.\n[7] I disagree with Appellant's assessment of the evidence. The country condition evidence indicates that \"government and societal violence and discrimination against ethnic minorities, including Roma, Sinti and the nomadic Caminanti, remained a problem.\"4 The evidence also points to intolerance against African migrants. In addition, the Appellant correctly points to disturbing findings of a United Nation (UN) body investigating racism in Italy which found numerous inflammatory remarks by politicians and \"an increase of intolerance, racial and religious hatred and xenophobia.\" 5 The report notes some high-level efforts to combat racism and intolerance but enjoins Italy to do more, particularly against hate speech. There is no evidence that the Appellant, who possesses Italian citizenship, would be forced to become an illegal agricultural worker who might be subjected to discriminatory employment practices noted in the country condition evidence.6 The Appellant is not, nor does he appear to be, an ethnic minority or African migrant. The Appellant is of the majority religious group in Italy. Having reviewed the totality of the evidence, I find that the RPD was correct in its assessment of the Appellant's risk as a \"new generation\" Italian. In making this finding, I am guided by the United Nation High Commissioner for Refugee (UNHCR) Handbook on Refugees as cited by the RPD.7 I find that there is insufficient evidence that the Appellant would be considered a \"new generation Italian\" and would face \"serious restrictions on his right to earn his livelihood, his right to practise his religion, or his access to normally available educational facilities.\"8 I find that there is insufficient evidence that the Appellant has the profile which would put him at risk for the intolerant and racist acts described in the country condition evidence.\n[8] I also find that there is insufficient evidence that the Appellant would come to the notice of those people trafficking in drugs between Colombia and Italy. The Appellant argues that the drug trade is particularly strong between Columbia and Europe and on this basis, he faces \"a serious risk of harm in both countries.\" I have considered the Appellant's argument about the historic collaboration between criminal gangs in Colombia and Italy. Italy has a population of more than 62 million people and at least six large urban cities. There is no evidence that the Appellant, amongst all the population of Italy, would engage in conduct, or would otherwise come, to the attention of people trafficking in drugs between Colombia and Italy.\nCONCLUSION\n[9] Pursuant to section 111(1)(a) of the Act,9 I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nPamela Arnott\nPamela Arnott\nDate\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\nRAD File \/ Dossier de la SAR : VC1-02055\nRAD.25.02 (August 20, 2021)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n2\nImmigration and Refugee\nBoard of Canada\nRefugee Appeal Division\nCommission de l'immigration et du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 du Canada\nSection d'appel des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s\nRAD.25.02 (August 20, 2021)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] I dismiss this appeal. XXXX XXXX (Appellant) is citizen of Pakistan.\na. The Appellant is a Shia Muslim. He fears retribution from representatives of the Taliban because they believe that he insulted Sunni clerics during a celebration of his son's birth. This incident caused the representatives to attack and threaten him on several occasions. The Appellant left Pakistan for the United States in XXXX 2016 but returned to Pakistan in August of the same year. After continuing to receive telephone threats and seeing suspicious men, he returned to the United States in XXXX 2016 and crossed into Canada in XXXX 2017.\nb. The RPD found that he could relocate to Islamabad. The Appellant argues that the RPD included implausibility findings in his credibility determination and did not fully consider his evidence. He also argues that the RPD erred in its analysis of the first and second prongs of the Internal Flight Alternative analysis (IFA). Having failed to consider them separately, he argues that the RPD did not consider whether the agents of persecution could locate him in Islamabad.\nc. The determinative issue for the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) is whether the agents of persecution can locate the Appellant in Islamabad.\nd. I find that the Appellant does not face a serious possibility of persecution in Islamabad, or a risk to life, a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture, on a balance of probabilities. The RPD erred in its credibility assessment by failing to consider relevant documentary evidence, by drawing credibility conclusions grounded in implausibilities and by failing to fully consider the Appellant's explanations for why he did not request asylum in the United States. The RPD erred in its IFA analysis, having failed to analyse the first prong of the IFA. On appeal, I have found that the Appellant's agents of persecution do not have the ability to locate him in Islamabad and reconfirm the RPD's conclusion that it is reasonable for the Appellant relocate to that city.\nDECISION\n[2] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither Convention refugees nor a person in need of protection.\nBACKGROUND\n[3] The Appellant is from Gujrat, Pakistan.\n[4] The Appellant and his wife married in 2004 amid disapproval from the family and community. They did not experience any troubles until October 2015 when he arranged for a Shia celebration at his home. His father-in-law surprised them with a visit and was upset at seeing his daughter partaking in a Shia celebration. In December 2015, the Appellant and his wife organised a celebration to bless their infant son. The Appellant invited a Shia cleric and his father-in-law invited Sunni clerics. Differences in the recitation of prayers at the event resulted in shoving and hitting among the clerics, his father and his father-in-law, for about fifteen minutes.\n[5] A week after that event, the Appellant received a phone call alleging that he had made a mockery of a Sunni cleric. In January 2016, he was attacked and threatened by three men that he believes are Taliban members. He reported the situation to the police who did not reference the Taliban in the report. A week later, he got another phone call where the Taliban identified itself. He reported the call, but no action was taken. He moved to Gujranwala but continued to receive calls.\n[6] The Appellant left Pakistan for the United States in XXXX 2016 and remained there until XXXX 2016 without requesting asylum. Upon return to Gujranwala, he stayed with his uncle and his family visited from Gujrat. He continued to receive calls and his wife thought she saw suspicious people outside the house. They called the police. The Appellant returned to the USA in XXXX 2016 and crossed into Canada in XXXX 2017.\nANALYSIS\n[7] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.1\nCredibility\nThe RPD's credibility assessment is incorrect. The Appellant is credible about the basis of his claim.\n[8] I agree with and accept the following arguments made by the Appellant:\na. The RPD incorrectly concluded that it was implausible that the Appellant would invite a Shia cleric to the celebration of his son's birth.\nb. The RPD failed to consider the Appellant's explanations provided in testimony and in his BOC narrative for why he did not claim asylum in the United States.\nc. The RPD failed to consider documentary evidence presented by the Appellant, including a medical certificate, a letter from the \"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX\", a First Information Report, and two affidavits.\n[9] While I accept that the Appellant was targeted by Sunni clerics following an incident that occurred at an event to bless his infant son, I do not find that the Appellant has established on a balance of probabilities whether he is being sought out by the leadership of the militant organisation the Tehreek-e-Taliban, or whether local extremists associating themselves with the Taliban reacted to the perceived insult of Sunni clerics at his son's event. In that sense, the RPD did not err when it concluded that the Appellant's profile as a Shia Muslim is not high-profile. I will explain why in my Internal Flight Alternative analysis.\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\nThe RPD's IFA analysis is incorrect, but the Appellant still has a viable IFA in Islamabad\n[10] The RPD found that Islamabad is a viable IFA for the Appellant. I agree with the Appellants that the RPD incorrectly carried out its IFA analysis by failing to analyse the first prong. The RPD did not assess the motivation and ability of the agents of persecution to locate the Appellant in Islamabad.\nFirst prong: The Appellant has not established that the agents of persecution can locate him in Islamabad\n[11] I find that the Appellant's agents of persecution do not have the ability to locate him in Islamabad.\n[12] When the Appellant was physically confronted and hit in the head by the agents of persecution, they did not identify themselves as the Taliban, but were dressed in clothing and had long beards consistent with how Sunni extremists associated with the Taliban present themselves. In a subsequent threatening phone call to the Appellant, the agents of persecution identified themselves as being associated with the Taliban and expressed that there would be severe consequences if he reported them to the police.\n[13] While these incidents establish that his assailants are Sunni extremists, I find that it is not clear that they are connected to the Tehreek-e-Taliban as an organisation. If the assailants are connected to the Tehreek-e-Taliban, the fact of their position and influence within that organisation has not been established on a balance of probabilities.\n[14] The agents of persecution had access to information about the Appellant's family and home because his father-in-law invited Sunni clerics to his home in December 2015. Around the 21st of December, the Appellant received a phone call where the caller informed him that he had insulted Sunni clerics. On January 4, 2016, the agents of persecution confronted him near his home and hit him on the head. Shortly thereafter, the Appellant received a threatening phone call warning him not to report the matter to the police or they would take his life. The Appellant reported the call to the police. The Appellant received two more calls but did not answer them. He left Pakistan in XXXX 2016 and returned in XXXX 2016. When he returned to Pakistan, he did not return to Gujrat, though his family remained there. He elected to stay with his uncle in Gujranwala, about fifty kilometres away. His family came to stay with him there in November 2016. On about December 11, 2016, the Appellant and his wife saw two men dressed in extremist clothing outside who were observing the home. The Appellant called the police, but the men left the area before the police arrived. Two days before that incident, the Appellant received another call telling him that he cannot hide, that he will meet his end and that they know everything about him. For this reason, he left Pakistan on XXXX XXXX, 2016, and returned to the United States, eventually making his way to Canada.\n[15] I find that the pattern of incidents establishes that these assailants are not connected to a large network enabling them to easily locate him, on a balance of probabilities. Most of the contact occurred by telephone. Given that the Sunni clerics had been to his home, the agents of persecution knew where he lived. They did not attack his home, though they did assault him near his home when he left for work. Most of their threats have been telephone calls. The agents of persecution have located him physically at his home in Gujrat or at his secondary residence in Gujranwala, which is close to his home. Though the Appellant has reported several of the incidents to the police, the evidence does not establish that the agents of persecution are receiving information regularly from the police or that the police are cooperating with them, on a balance of probabilities.\n[16] The Appellant argues that the RPD ignored relevant objective documentary evidence indicating that a viable IFA is not available to individuals at risk of being targeted by armed militant groups and that these groups have links with influential actors.2 He also argues that the RPD ignored objective documentary evidence attesting to the pervasiveness, strength and connected nature of the Taliban.3 A review of the current objective documentary evidence confirms that this objective evidence is still in force.4 However, I have found that the Appellant has not been targeted by agents of persecution who have either links or access to the force and influence of these armed militant groups. For this reason, I do not find that the Appellant will be targeted by armed militant groups in Islamabad as a result of the situation at the basis of his claim.\n[17] The evidence leads me to conclude that the agents of persecution continue to demonstrate interest in the Appellant. However, the evidence also leads me to conclude that the Appellants do not have the means to locate the Appellant in Islamabad, on a balance of probabilities.\n[18] There is no indication that the Appellant's family-in-law is informing the agents of persecution of where the Appellant can be found. On a balance of probabilities, I find that the event to bless his son is the source of his problems with the Sunni clerics and has led them to threaten him. Though they were invited to the event by his father-in-law, it does not appear that his father-in-law is involved with threatening the Appellant. For this reason, I do not find that moving to Islamabad will cause the Appellant to break contact with family members, including his wife's family.\n[19] I do not find that the Appellant will face persecution generally as a Shia Muslim in Islamabad. The objective documentary evidence indicates that though anti-Shia discrimination can occur at the community level, there is no evidence of systemic discrimination against Shia Muslims in the public and private sectors in Pakistan.5 Though there can be incidents of anti-Shia violence in urban areas, the evidence indicates that sectarian violence is primarily concentrated in areas where there are high numbers of Shia Hazaras, and in the Federally Administrated Tribal Areas (FATA).6 The Appellant testified that he did not have any significant problems prior to the incidents related to his father-in-law's reactions and his son's birth, and confirmed that his family members have not had any problems since those incidents.\nSecond prong: The Appellant can reasonably relocate to Islamabad\n[20] I accept the Appellant's argument that in its analysis of the reasonableness of Islamabad as an IFA, the RPD referred to the Appellant as \"the claimants\", suggesting boilerplate reasoning. This error does not automatically render the RPD's analysis of the second prong incorrect, but it does suggest that it employed text previously used to render a different decision. In my analysis, I have considered the RPD's conclusions on the reasonableness of an IFA in Islamabad in the context of the facts that are specific to the Appellant's situation.\n[21] After considering the Appellant's situation, and after reviewing the RPD's reasons pertaining to his university education, language skills, employability, financial situation and ability to relocate, I find that the RPD did not err when it found that the Appellant could reasonably relocate to Islamabad. The Appellant has not raised any arguments related to the reasonableness of Islamabad as an IFA on appeal. He did not raise any objection to Islamabad during testimony with respect to its reasonableness. I will not repeat the RPD's reasoning at length in this decision but adopt certain paragraphs with respect to the IFA analysis as my own.7\nCONCLUSION\n[22] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nAyanna Roberts\nAyanna Roberts\nOctober 28, 2020\nDate\nAR\/dd\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD File \/ Dossier de la SAR : TB9-28135\nRAD.25.02 (January, 2020)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n2\nImmigration and Refugee\nBoard of Canada\nRefugee Appeal Division\nCommission de l'immigration\net du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 du Canada\nSection d'appel des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s\nRAD.25.02 (January, 2020)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX (the female appellant) and her three children, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXandXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX citizens of Mexico, are appealing the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejecting their claim for refugee protection.\n[2] The female appellant, XXXX XXXX XXXX, was appointed as the designated representative for her two minor children, XXXX XXXXandXXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[3] In making its decision, the panel considered the Chairperson's Guideline on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.\n[4] For the reasons set out below the appeal is dismissed.\nBACKGOUND\n[5] In her Basis of Claim Form (BOC Form), the female appellant alleges that, in Mexico, she fears her former spouse, XXXX, who is the biological father of her eldest son, male appellant XXXX XXXX. She alleges that she lived with XXXX from 1998 to 2002 in the city of Tijuana, in the state of Baja California.\n[6] The female appellant alleges that she left XXXX in XXXX 2002 because he was violent and returned with her son to her place of origin, the state of Chiapas. There she met her new spouse, XXXX XXXX with whom she had the other two children (the appellants) and who adopted her eldest son.\n[7] The female appellant alleges that on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, some men tried to kidnap her eldest son. She alleges that she then received a telephone call telling her that her eldest son would be kidnapped and recruited by his biological father, who would draw him into his criminal activities, and she and her new spouse would be killed.\n[8] After taking refuge in a neighbouring town (XXXX) for about 10 months, the appellants left Mexico for Canada on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, where they claimed refugee protection. XXXX XXXX the female appellant's spouse, stayed in Mexico as he had not obtained the authorization required to travel to Canada.\n[9] The female appellant alleges that on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2020, her spouse in Mexico received a threatening call from XXXX and filed a complaint against him.\n[10] Following a hearing held on March 6, 2020, and in its reasons dated June 22, 2020, the RPD rejected the claim for refugee protection on the grounds that the appellants' central allegations were not credible.\n[11] Before the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD), the appellants submit that the RPD erred in its assessment of their credibility, for reasons that will be set out later in the \"Analysis\" section, if necessary.\n[12] For these reasons, the appellants are asking the RAD to set aside the determination of the RPD and grant them refugee protection or, alternatively, refer the matter to the RPD for re-determination by a differently constituted panel.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW AND ROLE OF THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION\n[13] The role of the RAD is to review RPD decisions by applying the correctness standard of review after conducting its own analysis of the record to determine whether, as submitted by the appellants, the RPD erred.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[14] The appellants presented five documents before the RAD that they claim is new evidence under subsection 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), which states the following:\nOn appeal, the person who is the subject of the appeal may present only evidence that arose after the rejection of their claim or that was not reasonably available, or that the person could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection.\n[15] In addition to the explicit conditions set out in subsection 110(4) of the IRPA, the RAD must also consider the implicit conditions pertaining to the admissibility of new evidence as established by the Federal Court of Appeal in Singh (M.C.I. v. Parminder Singh, 2016 FCA 96) and, in particular, the criteria of credibility and relevance of new evidence.\n[16] The first document is an excerpt from Wikipedia Maps showing the location of the town of XXXX, in Chiapas, in relation to the town of XXXX XXXX where the appellants lived.\n[17] I accept this document into evidence. It is relevant to one of the RPD's conclusions, which will be addressed later on. Although it predates the RPD's decision, I am of the opinion that the appellants could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented it at the time of the rejection.\n[18] The second document is a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2020, confirming that the appellants took refuge at her home in XXXX, on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019.\n[19] I do not accept this document into evidence. Although it postdates the rejection of the claim, the information contained therein predates the rejection and the appellants do not explain in their memorandum why they did not present such a document before the RPD.\n[20] The third document is the birth certificate of male appellant XXXX XXXX, dated XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[21] I do not accept this document into evidence. It predates the rejection of the claim, and the RPD had given the appellants a time limit for submitting it before it, following the hearing, which they did not do. The appellants do not explain in their memorandum why they did not submit this document before the RPD, as requested, when the female appellant had stated that she was in possession of it, or how or why they subsequently obtained it, [translation] \"with great difficulty,\" as mentioned in paragraph 19 of their memorandum.\n[22] The fourth document is a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX, dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2020, confirming that she helped the female appellant in 2001 and 2002 in Tijuana because of problems she was having with her spouse, XXXX.\n[23] I do not accept this document into evidence. Although it postdates the rejection of the claim, the information contained therein predates the rejection and the appellants do not explain in their memorandum why they did not present this document before the RPD. In addition, this document does not meet the criterion of relevance mentioned above, in that the facts reported therein were deemed credible by the RPD. The RPD believes the female appellant with respect to her relationship with XXXX from 1998 to 2002. As will be detailed later, what the RPD does not believe are the alleged events in 2019 and 2020.\n[24] The fifth document is a copy of written exchanges on Facebook between the female appellant and the author of the letter referred to in the preceding paragraph.\n[25] I do not accept this document into evidence because it does not meet the criterion of relevance mentioned above.\nHEARING BEFORE THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION\n[26] Subsection 110(6) of the IRPA states the following:\nThe Refugee Appeal Division may hold a hearing if, in its opinion, there is documentary evidence referred to in subsection (3)\n(a) that raises a serious issue with respect to the credibility of the person who is the subject of the appeal;\n(b) that is central to the decision with respect to the refugee protection claim; and\n(c) that, if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the refugee protection claim.\n[27] Although new evidence has been admitted before the RAD, I am of the opinion that there is no cause to hold an oral hearing in this case as this document, as will be addressed later on, does not meet criteria (a), (b) and (c) of subsection 110(6) of the IRPA, referred to above.\nANALYSIS\n[28] The issue in this case is whether the RPD erred in its assessment of the appellants' credibility, particularly that of the female appellant, who was the principal witness in this case.\n[29] I am of the opinion that the answer to that question is no, for the following reasons.\n[30] The RPD's finding is based on a number of contradictions, omissions and implausibilities that, in its opinion, undermine the appellants' credibility. In analyzing the evidence presented, I reach the same conclusion as the RPD.\n[31] The elements noted by the RPD are as follows:\nA. There is a contradiction between the testimony of male appellant XXXX XXXX, according to which he did not have help in escaping the alleged attempted kidnapping on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, and the information in the complaint filed by the female appellant's spouse on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2020, according to which some people intervened to help male appellant XXXX XXXX at the time of that incident.\nB. There is a contradiction in the female appellant's testimony regarding the location where the appellants took refuge following the alleged attempted kidnapping, either in another neighbourhood of the city or in another city. Furthermore, the female appellant's testimony that the appellants had walked for three to four hours to get there is implausible.\nC. There is an omission in the BOC Form regarding the fact that the appellants were provided with free accommodation for 10 months by unknown individuals in the town of XXXX.\nD. The appellants did not submit, before the RPD, male appellant XXXX XXXX birth certificate, dated XXXX2018, whose obtention in Tijuana would have resulted in XXXX being informed of their place of residence.\nE. The appellants contacted the Civil Registry Office in Tijuana, in 2010, for the procedures to adopt male appellant XXXX XXXX and were not tracked down by XXXX at that time.\nF. It is implausible that XXXX, who is allegedly a member of a cartel, was never able to track down the female appellant in Chiapas, when she was living with her family before 2019.\n[32] In their memorandum, the appellants only specifically challenge finding \"B\" referred to above.\n[33] And I agree with them regarding the fact that there was a misunderstanding on the RPD's part, due to the interpretation from Spanish to French of the terms that were used: colonia and quartier [neighbourhood]. The Spanish word colonia can also refer to another city, not just another neighbourhood of the city. In addition, because of the new evidence admitted before the RAD, it seems to me that it is not implausible that the appellants may have walked three to four hours to get to the neighbourhood in the town of XXXX where they allege they went.\n[34] However, even though this determination of the RPD is erroneous, this error is not sufficient to alter the RPD's decision as a whole.\n[35] There are still other contradictions, omissions and implausibilities that were not explained, which have not been challenged by the appellants and which, in my opinion, are sufficient to undermine the credibility of the appellants' central allegations.\n[36] Like the RPD, I am of the opinion that important elements of the claim were not established; namely, that a request to obtain the birth certificate issued in XXXX XXXX could have led XXXX to suddenly track down the appellants when XXXX had not been able to do so before, considering his alleged profile and the fact that the appellants had previously contacted the Civil Registry Office in Tijuana. In addition, the evidence surrounding the alleged attempted kidnapping in XXXX 2019 is contradictory with respect to whether male appellant XXXX XXXX received help or not.\n[37] Consequently, in light of the foregoing, I conclude that the appellants have failed to demonstrate that the RPD committed errors that would justify the RAD's intervention.\nREMEDY\n[38] For these reasons, I confirm the determination of the RPD, namely, that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXandXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX are not \"Convention refugees\" under section 96 of the IRPA or \"persons in need of protection\" within the meaning of section 97 of the IRPA.\n[39] The appeal is dismissed.\n(signed)\nNormand Leduc\nNormand Leduc\nJanuary 18, 2021\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\nRAD File No. \/ No de dossier de la SAR : MC0-09312\nMC0-09313 \/ MC0-09314 \/ MC0-09315\nRAD.25.02 (January 2020)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n3\nImmigration and Refugee\nBoard of Canada\nRefugee Appeal Division\nCommission de l'immigration\net du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 du Canada\nSection d'appel des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s\nRAD.25.02 (January 2020)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] These are my reasons for allowing the appeal by XXXX XXXX XXXX (Ms. B). After independently reviewing the record, I find that the Refugee Protection Division's (RPD) decision is incorrect and that Ms. B is a Convention refugee.\nBACKGROUND\n[2] Ms. B is a Jewish transgender (trans) woman and citizen of the United States. She came to Canada seeking protection in 2019 because she fears that the American police and justice system will not protect her against transphobic Americans generally. Ms. B testified to incidents of transphobia and fear-mongering by American politicians and civil organizations and violence against trans women. She also testified to experiences of discrimination and transphobia in her own employment and housing and to her experiences seeking police protection on multiple occasions.\n[3] In addition to fearing transphobic persecution by society, Ms. B fears targeting by a few specific individuals. She fears that her ex-roommate, her ex-landlord, and a debt collection agency are targeting her with threats and violence. In 2015 Ms. B sought protection against her ex-roommate after he threatened her with a gun in the room. She was given temporary protection until the charges were withdrawn, and her application for a permanent protective order was declined. Ms. B moved to several different locations in Colorado but still encountered her ex-roommate at these new locations. Police did not respond to her calls reporting these encounters.\n[4] Ms. B's ex-landlord won a civil lawsuit against her. As a result, Ms. B is required to provide the court with her updated address information every time she moves. This information is accessible to Ms. B's ex-landlord. In addition, Ms. B's ex-roommate appeared at some of the civil court proceedings alongside her ex-landlord. As a result, Ms. B believes he is being fed her address information from her former landlord, enabling him to continue stalking and threatening her.\n[5] In 2021, Ms. B was contacted by an agent acting on behalf of a company to which she owes money. In an email to Ms. B, the agent threatened to take action against her.\n[6] Ms. B represented herself before the RPD. The RPD found Ms. B credible and accepted that she faces problems with her ex-roommate, ex-landlord, and a debt collector. The RPD also accepted that trans individuals in the United States face discrimination, harassment, and violence which could lead to persecution. However, the RPD found that, in Ms. B's case, her experiences did not establish persecution. The RPD rejected Ms. B's claim because it found that she had not established, on a balance of probabilities, that the United States was either unwilling or unable to protect her.\nArguments on appeal\n[7] Ms. B remains self-represented in her appeal before the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD). She argues the RPD failed to consider her evidence and that this resulted in a procedurally unfair process. She further argues that the RPD erred by basing its assessment of state protection on the degree of protection available to cisgendered women rather than trans women. Ms. B argues that American federal and state laws are a patchwork of inadequate protections that are unable to meaningfully protect trans women. She further argues that the social and political climate in the United States tends toward regression and rescinding of past protections afforded to trans individuals. Ms. B further points to her personal experience of attempts to obtain police protection to address stalking and argues that this is evidence of an unwillingness by the police to protect.\n[8] On March 2, 2022, I provided the Minister and Ms. B with notice1 that I would be considering the availability of internal flight alternatives (IFA) in the states of Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Nevada, New Jersey, and New York. I also sought submissions on the effectiveness of protection orders, and clarification from Ms. B on her ability to obtain further protection after her application for a permanent protection order was denied. I further notified the Minister and Ms. B of my intent to rely on the current National Documentation Package (NDP) for the United States (US), dated February 3, 2022, as well as on a report by Freedom House, titled From Crisis to Reform: A Call to Strengthen America's Battered Democracy. Since this document does not appear in the NDP for the US, a hard copy and link to the document was provided.2\n[9] To date, the Minister has not provided any submissions or intervened in any way in these proceedings.\n[10] Ms. B has introduced several pieces of new evidence both prior to and following my March 2022 Directions. She has also requested an oral hearing.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[11] According to the law,3 I can only accept evidence that arose after the rejection of the claim, was not reasonably available, or could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have been presented at the time of the RPD decision. If the evidence meets one or more of these requirements, I must decide if the evidence is new, credible and relevant before I can accept it.4\n[12] When appellants submit further evidence after their appeal record has been perfected, I am required to ask additional questions before allowing the late submissions. These questions ask whether the late submissions are relevant, probative, and bring any new evidence to the appeal and whether the submissions could reasonably have been provided with the perfected record.5\n[13] In both cases, it is up to the appellant to make full and detailed submissions about how any of the proposed new evidence meets the requirements of the law and how that evidence relates to them.6\n[14] Ms. B's appeal record was perfected on September 15, 2021. Included in her appeal record and in the multiple Rule 29 applications7 that she subsequently made are news articles and reports, US and Canadian court decisions, US statutes, journal articles, and her written submissions. The Canadian court decisions8 and international human rights covenants9 will be considered, but they do not constitute new evidence and therefore are not subject to a new evidence assessment.\nEvidence that is not admitted\n[15] Ms. B provided several US court decisions and statutes in her Rule 29 applications that relate to the treatment of Black Americans or excessive use of force by police. She argues that these cases are relevant because they demonstrate the inherent injustice built into the US legal system. She further argues that she did not know that this type of evidence would be necessary at the time that the RPD made its decision. I accept that explanation, and I accept that she may not have been able to submit these documents with her perfected appeal record because she is self-represented. However, I still decline to admit these documents because I find that they are not directly relevant to the determinative issue in the appeal. Ms. B is a white woman.10 While there is, undeniably, a history of racially unjust and oppressive laws in the US justice system, that does not mean that Ms. B is targeted or affected by those laws and policies. The cases about excessive use of force by police officers are in relation to cisgender men. I recognize M.s B's argument that the police are able to mistreat and abuse trans people because of the application of \"qualified immunity.\"11 While the information in these cases may be new, and credible, I find that this evidence is neither directly relevant nor probative to the appeal. Yet another case deals with voting rights. While this deals with the state of democracy in the US, I find this information about challenges to voting rights is already generally present in the NDP and other country documents for the US. Therefore, this case brings no new or relevant information to the appeal. For these reasons, I decline to admit the following cases Brandenburg v Ohio12, Shelby County v Holder,13 Daniel Rivas-Villegas v Ramon Cortesluna,14 City of Tahlequah, and Oklahoma et al. v Austin P. Bond.15 I also decline to admit S. 3178, \"An Act to amend title 18 of the United States Code, to specify lynching as a deprivation of civil rights.\"16 I further decline to admit the news article related to Congress's failure to pass an anti-lynching law.17\n[16] I decline to admit the cases and articles relating to Hillary Clinton and the Democratic party's leadership.18 These cases pre-date the RPD decision, and there is insufficient explanation as to how these documents bring relevant and probative new evidence to the issues on appeal.\n[17] Ms. B provided a copy of a court Order List dated Monday, October 18, 2021,19 and a copy of the UK libel decision in Russell v Duke Norfolk20 in a Rule 29 application. No explanation for the Order List or the libel decision was provided. I have already accepted Ms. B's explanation for being unable to produce any of her new evidence before the RPD made its decision, and I have found that, as a self-represented person, it is reasonable to expect that she would not have thought to produce all of the available evidence at the time her appeal record was perfected. However, absent any explanation from Ms. B, I do not see how the libel decision or court Order List brings any relevant or probative new evidence to the determinative issues in the appeal. I therefore decline to admit these documents.\n[18] Other cases and articles21 relate to the right to abortion and reproductive choice previously protected under Roe v Wade22 and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern PA v Casey.23 Ms. B has provided copies of these decisions and articles discussing abortion rights. I find that this issue is tangentially related to Ms. B's claim insofar as it pertains to US political and judicial views on reproductive choice and freedoms. However, with the exception of the draft decision in Dobbs and articles discussing that decision, I find the cases and articles focusing on abortion rights alone and the leak of the draft Dobbs decision24 add little relevant and probative information to the appeal. The articles and cases are not new (they pre-date the rejection of the claim), and insufficient explanation was given as to why they were not submitted at the time of perfecting the appeal. For these reasons, I decline to admit these documents as the requirements of Rule 29(4) have not been met.25\n[19] Ms. B also provided a copy of the Hartford Guidelines and several decisions of the International Criminal Tribunals for Rwanda and the Former Yugoslavia.26 She argues that these documents are relevant to establishing the constitutive elements of persecution. I disagree. My assessment is guided by Canadian law on the topic, and while international law is informative, I do not find it determinative in this case. The definition of persecution for the purposes of international criminal law is different from the definition applied in refugee law. I am assessing Ms. B's claim under Canadian refugee law. I therefore find that these documents do not bring relevant or probative evidence to the appeal. They are also not new (they pre-date the rejection of the claim), and insufficient explanation was given as to why they were not submitted at the time of perfecting the appeal. For these reasons, I decline to admit these documents as the requirements of Rule 29(4) have not been met.\n[20] Finally, Ms. B provided late submissions and evidence packages on August 28, 2022, and October 10, 2022. I decline to admit any of the August 28, 2022, documents. Although these documents (primarily news articles) relate to recent events in the US, they are essentially more of the same evidence on the hostility toward trans individuals in the media and in some US states. I find the evidence already in the record adequately speaks to these issues and, therefore, that this evidence is not new because it does not bring new information. Similarly, the information about the site \"Kiwi Farms\" was already presented to the RPD, and the recent articles about the site's targeting of a Canadian trans woman does not bring relevant or probative information regarding Ms. B's claim or personal experience. As a result, I decline to admit these documents as they add little relevant, new, and probative information to the appeal.\n[21] The October 10, 2022, documents are much like those in the August 28, 2022, package. Some of the documents are undated or pre-date the RPD decision.27 Insufficient explanation was given as to why they were not submitted at the time of perfecting the appeal. These documents are publicly available and were accessible to Ms. B. I find that they could have been provided with the appeal record. I therefore decline to admit these documents. Other documents are court decisions,28 news articles,29 and a public relations statement30 regarding the treatment of trans children and conditions in states other than Colorado and the proposed IFA location. They do not bring new information to the appeal that is not already present in the RPD record, the Appellant's Record, or in previous Rule 29 applications. Though new, in that they post-date the RPD decision, I find that these documents31 do not bring relevant or probative information to the appeal. With the exception of six articles which I discuss below, I decline to admit the documents in the October 10, 2022, package.\nThe remainder of Ms. B's evidence is admitted\n[22] The remainder of Ms. B's new evidence includes news articles,32 reports,33 journal articles,34 social media posts,35 and US legislation,36 legal\/political documents,37 and caselaw38. Although some of these documents pre-date39 the RPD decision, they are all admitted into evidence. I am mindful that Ms. B was self-represented at the RPD. While she is fairly sophisticated, her submissions reflect an unclear understanding of the legal tests and statutes that are applicable to the assessment of her claim. Therefore, I accept that she may not have known to produce relevant legislation, caselaw, and journal articles at the time the RPD decision was made. The documents that post-date the RPD decision could not have been provided before the decision was rendered. In terms of Ms. B's ability to have produced these documents with her perfected appeal record, I note that many of them post-date the perfection date, and I find Ms. B's failure to produce the documents that pre-date the appeal record's perfection is again explained by her status as a self-represented appellant before the RAD. I find that Ms. B would not have known the degree of proof she was required to muster in order to establish her case at the time of perfection and that this justifies the multiple voluminous submissions (nearly 8000 pages) of late evidence.\n[23] The documents provided with the appeal record must be new, credible and relevant to the appeal. The Rule 29 evidence must be probative as well. With the exception of the documents that I have declined to admit in paragraphs 15 to 20 of these reasons, I find that all of the documents in Ms. B's perfected Appellant's Record bring new, credible and relevant information to the issues in the appeal, particularly since the NDP for the US is very light, containing little information on the treatment of transgender individuals in the US. Similarly, I find that the Rule 29 documents that I have not already declined to admit, bring new, credible, relevant, and probative evidence to the appeal. The remaining Appellant's Record and Rule 29 documents include legislation, journal articles, human rights reports, and caselaw that speak to the way that politicians describe trans people and the way that their rights to equality and access to employment and public spaces are interpreted by the courts, law enforcement, and public policy groups. Other articles speak to the issue of internal flight alternatives, providing general information about the cost of living and housing in different cities or providing more specific information about the conditions in which trans individuals live in various cities and states across the US.40 I therefore find that the tests for the admissibility of new and late evidence have been met, and I allow these documents into evidence.\n[24] Ms. B provided twenty-one sets of her own written arguments41 with her Rule 29 applications between October 2021 and October 2022. These written submissions provide updates on the situation in the United States and explain the significance of recent landmark court decisions, as well as the articles and reports that she provided. Some of these submissions were provided in response to my Directions. I have already explained why I accept Ms. B's explanations for her late submission of evidence and written arguments. I find her submissions credible because they are prepared by her and, as such, presumed to be truthful. I further find the submissions relevant because they relate to new events and issues that Ms. B could not have been aware were relevant at the time she perfected her appeal record. In many cases, the submissions relate to contemporary events and incidents relating to the treatment of trans people in the US. Although there is some repetition to the submissions, I find that, overall, they satisfy the legal criteria of bringing new information to the appeal. Finally, I find the submissions probative because they address the determinative issues in the appeal. Consequently, the written submissions are all allowed into the record.\nAn oral hearing will not be held\n[25] I am not convening an oral hearing. The RAD may choose to hold an oral hearing only if there is new evidence that raises a serious issue about the Appellants' credibility, is central to the decision, and which, if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the claim. I find that the new evidence does not raise a credibility issue for Ms. B. Therefore, it is not necessary to test the new evidence at an oral hearing.\nANALYSIS\n[26] I have applied the standard of correctness while reviewing the RPD decision and have conducted an independent assessment of the evidence before me. This appeal was a difficult one. The issues are complex, and extra care is required because of Ms. B's status as an unrepresented appellant. Nevertheless, she has done an impressive job in corralling evidence to support her claim and in identifying errors in the RPD's decision. The evidence she produced for the RPD and RAD includes numerous country conditions documents, personal corroborating evidence of her attempts to gain state protection in America, police bodycam footage, statutes, legislative records, American and Canadian caselaw, and written submissions arguing the merits of her claim. I have reviewed all of these, and I have considered the Chairperson's SOGIESC Guidelines and the Gender Guidelines.42\n[27] I find that the RPD erred by failing to consider critical evidence on the events that took place after Ms. B's protection order was cancelled. Specifically, I find that the RPD failed to consider that Ms. B was denied police protection or investigation when she reported continued stalking by her ex-roommate near her residence seven separate times. The RPD also failed to consider how Colorado's open carry gun laws combined with the general climate of anti-trans hatred growing in the US could make Ms. B perpetually vulnerable and at risk to her life.\n[28] I further find that Ms. B does not have an IFA in the US because relocation for a person with her profile, in her circumstances, would be unreasonable. My reasons are as follows.\nTrans individuals face discrimination and significant risks to their lives in the US\n[29] It is clear from the country conditions evidence that trans individuals face considerable threats of physical, psychological, and social harm. \"Transgender people experience particularly high rates of discrimination in public places.\"43 Trans women of colour are especially targeted for violent hate crimes and killings.44 According to the Williams Institute, transgender people are \"over four times more likely than cisgender people to experience violent victimization, including rape, sexual assault, and aggravated or simple assault.\"45 The evidence shows that 2021 was the deadliest year for trans people in the US since 2013 and that 96 percent of those murdered in 2021 were trans women or trans feminine people.46 The extent of the violence that trans people face is also virtually unknown to the public. One report indicates that, despite 2021 being the deadliest year on record for trans people, transphobic violence received less than 45 minutes of collective reporting time by TV news stations during that year.47\n[30] Moreover, \"about half of all violent victimizations were not reported to police.\"48 This is consistent with the SOGIESC Guidelines, which note that \"under-reporting may be more pronounced for individuals who face marginalization.\"49 Country documents show that legal services and courts are among the essential services where trans people have reported experiences of discrimination.50 The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights wrote the following in its 2021 report on human rights in the US:\n\"... the IACHR is concerned that actions were taken that limit the training of public employees in the protection of rights. In this regard, the IACHR notes that on September 4, the director of the Office of Budget Management sent an instruction to the heads of the various government agencies to end training related to equality and non-discrimination. Subsequently, on October 8, the Department of Justice suspended all training for its personnel on diversity and inclusion.\"51\nWhen crimes are reported, it is, therefore, doubtful whether the justice system workers that a victim encounters have had adequate anti-discrimination training and awareness to handle their complaints without bias.\n[31] Hateful rhetoric against the trans community has also flourished in recent years. There are many open calls for direct action against trans and gender-nonconforming individuals and their allies, which have resulted in street gangs disrupting Pride events and the engagement of far-right aligned individuals in \"targeted harassment, intimidation, and threats against trans people, drag shows, and other LGBTQ events with increased frequency in recent years. ... there have already been 33 incidents in 2022, putting it on track to be even worse than last year.\"52\n[32] Public accommodations laws, which protect the rights of trans people to access services and spaces open to the public do not exist throughout the US.53 While nearly half of US states have some protections in place, the degree of protection offered varies considerably.54 Progressive steps to expand anti-discrimination protections for trans individuals have been considerably hampered in recent years by movements for religious exemptions to anti-discrimination laws, attempts to repeal anti-discrimination laws, bathroom bans prohibiting trans people from using bathrooms that accord with their gender identity, and the passage of state laws prohibiting the passage or enforcement of local, municipal or county non-discrimination laws.55 As Ms. B's evidence shows, in the first three months of 2022 alone nearly 240 anti-LGBTQ bills were filed, most of them targeting trans people.56 This marks a considerable rise from the 41 bills that were filed just four years earlier in 2018.57 In addition, the Southern Poverty Law Center has warned that \"anti-LGBTQ appointments to the judiciary will likely threaten trans and queer Americans' civil rights for a generation.\"58\n[33] Despite this, on the whole, Americans, including transgender Americans, are able to run for and hold public office, freely assemble, and advocate for their political causes.59 Though the rights of trans individuals are under political and cultural assault, the evidence shows that there is also pushback. The report on public accommodations laws indicates that nationally, there is broad public support for inclusive anti-discrimination laws, and that only about one-quarter of Americans (though still a sizable number) oppose equal rights for trans people.60\n[34] The evidence, therefore, shows three things. Firstly, that the trans community is at heightened risk of experiencing violence, harassment, and discrimination that could, in certain circumstances, be considered persecutory. Secondly, that across most of the US, trans people are excluded from protections that would enforce their right to equal treatment in public settings and in accessing services available to the public. This exclusion from protection makes the trans community vulnerable to further assaults on their rights. Thirdly, the evidence shows that the trans community is already facing active and increasing efforts to deny and restrict their rights to live freely, openly, and as equals in public spaces, even though there is broad public support for equal treatment of trans individuals.\nCredibility and facts established through the evidence\n[35] The RPD found Ms. B credible in her testimony about her experiences in America. I agree with this finding. Through her testimony and her supporting documentary evidence, Ms. B has established the following facts on the standard of a balance of probabilities:\n(a) She was rejected by her family because of her gender non-conformity and subjected to various forms of abuse. Her parents forced intake of XXXX drugs and put her through the torture of conversion therapy and boot camp to correct her perceived deviance.\n(b) She experienced discrimination in employment prior to her corrective surgery and afterward;\n(c) She relocated to Colorado because of its laws and reputation as a safe state for trans people;\n(d) She has had her deadname61 published on an international anti-trans website;\n(e) Her former roommate placed a gun in the room, facing toward her while threatening her and making transphobic statements. The police responded to her request for protection and arrested her roommate. The District Attorney (DA) charged Ms. B's ex-roommate with felony menacing, and a mandatory protection order was issued. The DA later dropped the charges in the interests of justice and because they would not be able to establish all the elements of the offence. When this happened, Ms. B sought and was denied her application in civil court for a permanent protection order.\n(f) Following the dropped charges, Ms. B's former roommate began stalking her, showing up outside of her home on seven occasions, even after she relocated twice. Ms. B called the police but did not receive protection against the continued stalking.62\n(g) Ms. B's former landlord initiated a civil proceeding against her for unpaid rent and damages. The landlord was awarded the judgment, and Ms. B was ordered to pay nearly $XXXX. During the court proceedings, Ms. B's former landlord was accompanied by the roommate that had threatened and stalked Ms. B. The former landlord also applied to the court to have Ms. B's deadname utilized in the proceedings. Because of the judgment, Ms. B must disclose her address to her former landlord.\n(h) A debt collection agency has threatened to take legal action against Ms. B to recoup monies that they claim they are owed.\n[36] The evidence does not, in my view, establish that the debt collection agency or Ms. B's former landlord were acting in a persecutory way by threatening to take her to court or by actually doing so in order to reclaim money that they are owed.\n[37] I am aware of Ms. B's claim that her former landlord is a trans-exclusionary radical feminist (TERF) and her argument that these political views motivated her former landlord to incite her former roommate to stalk her. I must make findings of fact on the standard of a balance of probabilities. I find the evidence that Ms. B has submitted is insufficient to impute a persecutory intent to her former landlord. I accept the possibility Ms. B's former landlord may hold anti-trans political views based on her insistence that Ms. B's deadname be used in court. However, it does not automatically follow that she actively wants to see Ms. B physically harmed or that she is making efforts to ensure that harm is directly inflicted. The evidence is simply too tenuous to establish that allegation as fact.\n[38] My findings lead me to conclude that Ms. B has experienced persecution in the past at the hands of her parents and that she has experienced considerable amounts of discrimination in her employment and relationships with housemates. On a forward-looking basis, I find that Ms. B faces a serious possibility of persecution by her former roommate based on her evidence of his threats against her, his stalking of her while openly carrying a gun, the police's refusal to act on her complaints of stalking, and the combination of general anti-trans violence and lax gun laws which elevate the risks that Ms. B faces of fatal violence by her former roommate. My reasons, therefore, focus on Ms. B's access to state protection against the threats and stalking by her former roommate and her ability to relocate elsewhere in the US to be protected against him.\nAdequate state protection is not available to trans individuals in most US states\n[39] It is generally accepted that the police are the primary source of state protection, and that states are not required to provide perfect protection in all instances.63\n[40] The evidence shows that trans individuals were able to go to the police to report incidents of violence and to seek protection. Some of the articles show that the police responded to these reports by arresting the trans victim rather than their assailants.64 Other evidence states that when a trans woman is a victim, police often assume that the trans woman instigated the violence or that the police dismiss or downplay the violence.65 A report on policing policies related to trans people shows that the vast majority of police departments in the US lack training and comprehensive policies on interactions with trans individuals.66 Other documents show that trans people are at higher risk of police violence,67 and \"law enforcement officials themselves are frequently perpetrators of anti-transgender violence.\"68 The Transgender Surveys indicate that across the country and regardless of state, very high percentages of trans individuals experience further abuse, victimization and abuse when they encounter police or go to them for help.69 These reports also reflect very high rates of unwillingness by trans individuals to approach the police for protection.70\n[41] However, that does not mean that every trans person in the US is reluctant to seek police help or that every trans person has experienced police abuse, harassment, or revictimization as a result.71 The evidence indicates that Ms. B was not afraid of approaching the police and that she was not abused or harassed by the police when she sought their help. But those facts alone do not establish that the protection Ms. B received was adequate. In assessing whether the protection Ms. B actually received was adequate, I am not assessing what is available to the general public; I am assessing the protection that was made available to her in the broader context of the risks she faces as a trans woman.\nUltimately, Ms. B did not receive adequate state protection\n[42] Ms. B has testified that she was discriminated against when she tried to access legal protection. She argues that the police informed her ex-roommate that his case would likely not go to trial and that neither the courts nor the police were interested in offering meaningful protection. In support, Ms. B provided police body camera footage, letters between her and the District Attorney (DA) addressing the DA's reasons for dropping the criminal charges, and the court reports related to her unsuccessful application for protection orders.\n[43] The RPD considered her evidence and found that the evidence demonstrated that Ms. B had, in fact, benefitted from state protection because the police responded to her call and arrested her ex-roommate; because the DA pursued the charges before deciding to drop them; and because the court had granted a mandatory protection order. The RPD also noted that the District of Columbia and nineteen states (including Colorado, where Ms. B lived) have enacted anti-discrimination laws to protect their LGBTQ+ residents.72 The RPD concluded that this meant that Ms. B had access to adequate protection going forward.\n[44] For the reasons that follow, I agree with the RPD's findings that Ms. B was not denied state protection when she first complained to the authorities about the threats from her husband, but I find that the RPD erred by failing to consider how Ms. B's subsequent complaints were handled by the police.\nProcedural fairness and the police response to threat by roommate in XXXX 2019\n[45] I have considered Ms. B's argument that the RPD breached her procedural fairness rights by willfully ignoring the video footage obtained from the body cams worn by police during the incident with her former roommate. In reviewing the RPD's reasons, I find that the RPD did consider this evidence but did not interpret its contents in the same way as Ms. B. Having viewed the footage and read the transcribed sections of the footage that Ms. B highlighted in her submissions to the RPD, I find the RPD's interpretation of the police interaction is correct. I find that the police officers were fair and respectful in their treatment of Ms. B. I do not see the police officer as having coached Ms. B's roommate on how to describe the incident. Nor do I find that the officer was dismissive of the facts. The officer's statements appear to be an attempt to explain to a scared man the legal process and charges that he would face. The officer was acknowledging that a gun was left pointed in Ms. B's direction intentionally by her roommate but also acknowledging the distinction that the gun was not in Ms. B's roommate's hands at that time and that this would lead to a lesser-used charge that did not often result in full criminal proceedings by the DA. In referring to a change in Ms. B's version of events, I understand the officer to be referring to her initial statement that the gun was in her roommate's hands when the threat was issued and the later clarification that it was not, as well as the difference between Ms. B's initial statement that her roommate made a gesture toward the gun and her later statement that he expressly referred to it but did not gesture.\n[46] I appreciate that Ms. B would have preferred for the police officer to have interacted differently with her roommate and to have accepted that the presence of the gun constituted a threat against her life. I also acknowledge the evidence stating that police often assume that trans women instigate the violence against them or that police dismiss or downplay the violence that trans women experience.73 But Ms. B's personal evidence does not demonstrate, in my view, any maliciousness on the part of the officers she encountered. In addition, the fact that multiple officers were present nearby but did not all appear inside the house does not reflect an unwillingness to enforce the law. Rather it reflects a measured response by the police, and the video indicates that they were concerned with making sure that they did not escalate a situation where they were aware that a weapon was present. All of this suggests to me that the officers were acting appropriately. As a result, I reject Ms. B's arguments that the RPD acted in bad faith or procedurally unfairly by ignoring her evidence. I also reject her argument that the evidence shows that the police in Colorado acted in bad faith when they responded to her call for help in XXXX 2019.\nThere is insufficient evidence to conclude that the DA and the court were biased\n[47] Ms. B has argued that she was denied justice because her ex-roommate was not convicted even though there was enough evidence for conviction under the charge of felony menacing. She provided copies of the relevant statutes.74 On the surface, it would appear that Ms. B's argument has merit. But neither she, nor I, are experts in US law, and the statute alone does not tell me about the standard on which the charges need to be proved. Nor do I have the totality of the evidence that the DA and court would have had before them.\n[48] The evidence from Ms. B shows that the DA initially proceeded with the charges but, within two months, decided to drop them \"in the interests of justice.\"75 I am mindful of the evidence I cited earlier about the lack of continued anti-discrimination training for Justice Department employees and that it leaves open the possibility that some discrimination or bias had a hand in the DA's decision not to pursue the charges. But there are many factors that go into decisions to prosecute, not all of which are rooted in bias. There is no way, on the evidence before me, to know what \"in the interests of justice\" means, but the motion to dismiss the charges gives some indication. It states that the charges were withdrawn because \"the People do not believe that they have a reasonable likelihood of success at trial.\"76 Admittedly, this is vague because it does not explain why the likelihood of success is considered low, but it points to reasons other than bias for the dropped charges.\n[49] Similarly, the court minutes regarding Ms. B's application for a personal protection order after the charges were dismissed state that she \"has not proven her case\" and \"has not met the criteria for a finding of a PPO.\"77 While the court's and the DA's explanations are vague, I find I would be relying excessively on speculation and supposition to reach the same conclusion as Ms. B with the evidence that I have before me. For these reasons, I find that the DA and the court did not act unfairly on in a biased way toward her by dropping the charges against her former roommate.\nMs. B was denied adequate protection after the charges against her ex-roommate were dropped\n[50] I find the RPD erred by failing to consider whether Ms. B continued to receive adequate protection after the charges against her ex-roommate were dropped. As the court noted in Moran Gudiel,78 for the state protection test to be correctly applied, one must consider the particular situation of the claimant and look at whether the state protection that was offered actually worked and yielded concrete results.79\n[51] Ms. B consistently stated that, after the charges were dropped and a further protection order denied, her ex-roommate stood outside her home on several separate occasions while holding his shotgun.80 She also gave credible and consistent evidence regarding the anti-trans slurs that he used against her.81 She indicated that his presence was particularly noteworthy because she had moved residences at least twice out of fear. She further indicated that she called the police each of these seven times, including once going to the police station to report the stalking behaviour. Each time she was told that her ex-roommate had the right to open-carry a firearm and that there was nothing the police could do to protect her.\n[52] There is nothing inherently improper about the police response to Ms. B's reports. Colorado is an open-carry state. Her ex-roommate could not, therefore, be found in violation of any laws simply because he was carrying a weapon. And because there were no protection orders requiring that he keep his distance from Ms. B, he could not be found in breach of any conditions or legal requirements. Ms. B has not indicated that he said anything to her when she saw him. Consequently, I understand why the police would have been unable to treat his lawful presence and possession of a weapon as a threat. It may be hard for authorities to prove that a stalker has no right to be where they are or that their intent is to threaten and harass.\n[53] That said, it is possible that victims are aware that they are being stalked but are unable to obtain any kind of protection for these kinds of reasons. Consequently, women in these situations are left highly vulnerable and in a state of near-perpetual insecurity.\n[54] In this respect, I find the RPD's assessment of Ms. B's risk to be lacking. It is not sufficient to say simply that there was no crime for the authorities to act on. It is significant, in my view, that the ex-roommate appeared in Ms. B's vicinity on seven occasions, each time with his gun. I note that in the body camera footage, Ms. B testified that until the day that she filed the first police complaint, she had never seen the gun,82 and her ex-roommate's partner indicated that they usually kept the gun inside their bedroom because it was intended only to respond to home invaders.83 The presence of the gun in public and in close proximity to the various locations where Ms. B had moved to after the protection order was dropped is highly noteworthy. As a result, I give Ms. B's interpretation of her ex-roommate's presence considerable weight. I find that by repeatedly appearing near Ms. B's various residences in the months leading up to her flight to Canada, her ex-roommate was attempting to terrorize her. The country conditions evidence shows that in just about half of all instances where trans individuals were murdered, they were killed by someone they knew.84 In 32 percent of fatal incidents of anti-trans violence, the killer was unknown to the victim.85\n[55] I have already discussed the evidence establishing that trans individuals live in a general climate of insecurity about their physical and psychological safety. It cannot be doubted that the ability of individuals to freely and openly carry guns only heightens the risk and fear of fatal assault faced by trans individuals, who already face elevated risks of both random and targeted violence.\n[56] Amnesty International describes gun violence in the US as a human rights crisis.86 It further states that \"[i]n the face of clear evidence of persistent firearm violence, high rates of gun ownership, and ease of access to firearms by individuals likely to misuse them, the USA is failing to meet its obligation to protect and promote human rights pursuant to international law.\"87\n[57] The evidence indicates that rates of gun homicides have increased in recent years.88 Every single state and district in the US allows for some form of concealed carrying of a firearm in public.89 It must also be noted that in 65 percent of all fatal anti-trans violence occurring between 2013 and 2019, guns were involved.90\n[58] Considered in this context of violent anti-trans public and political discourse, general harassment and violence towards trans people, the prevalence of firearms, and the right to openly carry firearms in public, I find Ms. B's fear of her ex-roommate and of general anti-trans violence is logical and supported by the evidence.\n[59] I am also aware that there are some similarities between this case and the facts in Miller,91 a case that was recently decided by the Federal Court. In Miller, the court found that the RAD erred by finding that US state protection was inadequate in protecting a woman fleeing her abusive white nationalist husband. The court held that the RAD erred by demanding perfect rather than adequate protection.\n[60] Although the Federal Court found that US state protection was adequate in Miller, that finding of fact is not binding on me. I am entitled, and obligated, to make my own independent findings of fact based on the evidence before me. Each case must be assessed on its own merits. And facts, including the fact of the availability of adequate state protection, must be determined on the standard of a balance of probabilities.\n[61] The similarities between Ms. B's case and the facts in Miller are that they are both American, both sought and received to some extent a protective response from state authorities, and both ultimately fled to Canada because, despite the state's efforts to provide protection, the threats and fear of violence and death continued. But the similarities end there.\n[62] Firstly, unlike in Miller, Ms. B was not offered additional protection when she continued to report that her ex-roommate kept appearing near her home while holding a shotgun. The police responded to subsequent reports of stalking in Miller, but they did not do so in Ms. B's case. Her reports were not investigated, and incident reports not made.92 Secondly, because the Miller decision related to a cisgender white woman, the RAD's decision, in that case, did not address the gaps that appear in the system of protection available to trans women or the way that gun violence, ownership, and open-carry laws exacerbate the vulnerability of trans women. As a result, I find the decision in Miller is not determinative of the question of state protection in Ms. B's case.\n[63] The SOGIESC Guidelines state that, in the state protection analysis, focus must be on \"the personal circumstances of the claimant, in conjunction with a fact-based analysis of the operational adequacy and effectiveness of state protection in the country of reference.\"93 The Guidelines further stress the importance of considering that SOGIESC individuals may face differential protection or uneven access to state protection based on additional factors such as race, ethnicity, religion, faith or belief system, age, disability, health status, social class and education.\"94\n[64] Ms. B is a trans woman who has lived in several US states and experienced discrimination or persecution in each beginning in her youth.95 She most recently sought safety in one of the seven US states that offer full-ranging public accommodations laws.96 Despite this, she has encountered discrimination that led to her relocation to different cities within Colorado.97 She remained in Colorado for over a decade until she was met with police refusal to investigate her reports of continued stalking by a man whom the authorities knew possessed a gun and had uttered transphobic slurs against her. Again, I note that Colorado is an open carry state and, therefore, that Ms. B would not have recourse to any protection unless and until her ex-roommate escalated his behaviour. For this reason, the refusal by police to investigate Ms. B's repeated reports of stalking by her ex-roommate lead me to find that she was denied adequate protection.\n[65] There is little to no evidence before me about the policies that are actually in force at police stations in Colorado. I have no evidence to indicate whether local police have received training or any kind of advice on interacting with trans individuals and understanding the unique threats that the trans community faces. The evidence I do have indicates that, on a balance of probabilities, there are only weak policies, if any exist at all, and that training was likely never offered at all.98 The anecdotal evidence of trans individuals' encounters with police also suggests that police sometimes lose interest in responding to similar complaints by the same person.99 Considered alongside previously cited evidence of police tendencies to minimize the threats and harms faced by trans victims, as well as Ms. B's own experience of police dismissing her complaints about stalking, I find that Ms. B is more likely than not to be denied further protection in Colorado if she again reports threats from her ex-roommate. As a result, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that state protection would not be forthcoming for Ms. B in Colorado. I further accept Ms. B's evidence that her repeated experience of having her complaints dismissed without investigation or action have caused her to be reluctant to approach the police for help in the future.\nInternal flight alternatives are not viable\n[66] The test100 to determine whether refugee claimants should be required to seek safety elsewhere in their country of origin is two-pronged. The first prong asks whether there are any parts of the country where the refugee claimant may live without facing a serious possibility of persecution. That assessment involves considering how motivated the agents of persecution are in finding the claimant and their capacity to reach them. If a safe location can be identified, then the decision-maker must consider the second prong of the test, which asks whether it would be reasonable under the circumstances to ask a person to relocate to that place.\n[67] In identifying potential IFA locations, I was mindful that the willingness of the state to enact preventative laws--those that prohibit the discrimination that builds to, encourages, and normalizes violence--is important in ensuring the right of trans people to a free and dignified life.\n[68] The SOGIESC Guidelines highlight that \"decriminalization of same-sex relations or sexual or gender non-conforming behaviours, or the introduction of a new law, program or other government action designed to improve the situation of SOGIESC individuals in a country, need to be carefully assessed to determine whether state protection is adequate at the operational level. In these cases, members need to examine the degree of actual implementation, the effectiveness, and the durability of these legislative or other improvements in light of how state actors and general society continue to treat SOGIESC individuals.\"101\n[69] To this end, I have considered the network of public accommodations laws in the US. Public accommodations relate to access to public spaces such as places of business, worship, transit, medical care, restaurants, etc. These laws are important because they are meant to enforce the rights of marginalized groups to access public spaces and services and because they allow equity-seeking groups to seek redress when discriminated against or denied access to services and spaces because of their identity.\n[70] The LGBT Policy Spotlight report indicates that the majority of states do not offer broad protection against discrimination in public accommodations. The report breaks down the protections available in each of the states where anti-discrimination laws have been enacted and assesses whether the laws prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, whether the law explicitly includes restaurants, hotels and similar businesses, and whether the law explicitly includes schools, public transportation and hospitals.102 Only seven states (Colorado, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Nevada, New Jersey, and New York) provide protection on all of those grounds.103 The remainder of the US-the vast majority-endorses by omission some form of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. I find that, for trans individuals, this means that there are only seven US states where their rights are theoretically fully protected and where they have the greatest chance of living a free and dignified life.\n[71] I have also considered the possibility that President Biden's Executive Order on Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation (\"Executive Order\")104 might positively impact the access that trans women have to protection generally. The Executive Order is currently being challenged, but not by the seven states that I have found to have comprehensive public accommodations protections. That said, I have no information on which to assess its efficacy in creating tangible change for trans individuals in these locations.\n[72] The RPD suggested IFAs of Los Angeles and San Francisco in California, the city of New York in New York state, and the cities of Portland, Oregon and Seattle, Washington. Based on my review of the evidence, I find that the states of Oregon, Washington and California do not have comprehensive accommodations laws that would protect Ms. B's right to equal treatment and access to public spaces and services.105 As a result, I am not considering those states in my IFA analysis.\n[73] As I noted earlier in my reasons, only seven states offer comprehensive accommodations laws. Colorado was one of them. Ms. B resided there, and I have found that it is not likely to offer adequate state protection to her in the future. In my Directions to Ms. B and the Minister, I considered whether any of the remaining six states: Delaware, Maine, New Jersey, Illinois, Nevada, and New York, could be suitable IFAs.\n[74] I have found that the state of Delaware is not a suitable IFA location because of the lack of information about the treatment of transgender individuals living there. I also determined that Maine, New Jersey, Illinois and Nevada are not suitable IFA locations because of the high rates of discrimination and violence experienced by transgender individuals there.106\n[75] For the purposes of these reasons, my assessment focuses on an IFA in New York City since it was canvassed in some detail by the RPD.\nFirst prong - There is no serious possibility of persecution in New York\n[76] I have considered whether Ms. B's former roommate has the motivation and the means to pursue Ms. B to New York City in order to harm her there. I find the evidence does not show that he has either.\n[77] Ms. B speculated that her ex-roommate was able to obtain her up-to-date address information from her former landlord to whom Ms. B was required to provide that information because of the court order in the civil judgment against her. Although Ms. B agreed that she was speculating that her former landlord was sending her ex-roommate to harass her, I find it less speculative that Ms. B's ex-roommate was getting her address information because of the court's requirement for disclosure. As a result, I find that Ms. B's ex-roommate has access to her address information if she does disclose it to the courts. I agree with the RPD's finding that it was too speculative to find that Ms. B's former landlord was using the ex-roommate as a debt collector. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that Ms. B's ex-roommate was accessing her address information through the former landlord but for his own purposes. However, I find the evidence is insufficient to establish that Ms. B's ex-roommate has the financial means or the motivation to locate her in New York all these years later. Although there is evidence that he pursued her to various addresses within the state of Colorado,107 I find the evidence insufficient to establish that he is motivated to look for her if she moved outside of the state. I note that there is no evidence of any attempts to contact Ms. B or anyone she knows in either the US or Canada. I find Ms. B does not face a serious possibility of persecution by her ex-roommate in New York City.\nSecond prong - relocation is unreasonable\n[78] In order for an IFA to be reasonable, it must be a place where the appellant will not encounter great physical danger or undue hardship in travelling to or living there.108 The appellant cannot be sent to live under conditions that would jeopardize their life or safety. Although the Federal Court has established a high threshold109 to demonstrate the unreasonableness of an IFA, it has also acknowledged that mental health,110 personal characteristics such as gender and age,111 and the availability of family support112 can impact the life and security of an individual.\n[79] The SOGIESC Guidelines warn that reliable and up-to-date country conditions information, particularly for trans individuals, can be scarce, incomplete, or general in nature.113 The Guidelines further advise that the lack of information may be caused by fears of reporting and marginalization.114 I find this relevant to the state of the country conditions information available regarding trans individuals in the US. Most of the country documents focus on efforts to curtail the rights of trans people in the US. Fewer documents examine the living conditions of trans individuals, and, as I have noted, little broadcast time is given to reporting on the violence that trans individuals experience. As a result, my assessment relies heavily on the results of the 2015 Transgender Surveys and NDP Items 6.1 and 6.2. Although the Transgender Survey is dated 2015, it remains one of the most current sources of information on the daily living conditions of trans individuals since no other similar surveys appear to exist.\n[80] I have considered whether Ms. B faces a degree of discrimination in the IFA locations that would make relocation unreasonable under all of the circumstances. The evidence before me is that transphobia is a nationwide problem and that New York City is no exception.\n[81] The Transgender Survey results show that there is a high rate of employment and housing discrimination in New York. In New York, the poverty rate among trans individuals was 37 percent,115 with 26 percent of respondents reporting that they had lost their jobs, been denied work, or been denied promotions because of their gender identity or expression.116 In New York, 21 percent of respondents experienced housing discrimination.117 Despite the existence of public accommodations laws, in the year prior to the survey, 35 percent of respondents had experienced some type of mistreatment-denial of equal treatment or service, verbal harassment, physical attack-at a place of public accommodation when the staff or employees of that place knew the person was transgender.118 More than half of respondents (58 percent) indicated that they avoided using public bathrooms because of the fear of confrontation.119 More than one third of respondents (32 percent) experienced some form of discriminatory treatment by a healthcare provider.120 On the subject of police protection, 61 percent of trans respondents to the survey in New York indicated that they experienced harassment and mistreatment by police, and 58 percent stated that would be uncomfortable seeking help from the police.121\n[82] The evidence on discrimination is troubling and demonstrates that trans individuals are likely to encounter various forms of discrimination. However, I see no evidence that the government in New York is creating an atmosphere of intolerance. I note again that trans individuals are able to advocate for their rights and to freely express themselves. While discrimination exists, it appears to be largely informal. Considered as a whole, I find that the evidence does not establish that Ms. B would experience a serious possibility of discrimination rising cumulatively to the level of persecution in New York City. Nor do I find that she faces a serious possibility of persecution by the general public there.\n[83] The rates of discrimination in New York, though not rising to the level of persecution, nevertheless inform my finding that relocation would be unreasonable for Ms. B. I note the evidence that poverty is a \"strong risk factor for violence in the United States\"122 and that poverty is widespread within transgender communities.123 One in five New Yorkers live in poverty, and one-quarter of all New Yorkers pay more than half of their income in rent.124 This situation has been aggravated by Covid-19.125 Notably, although only 18 percent of the Transgender Survey respondents were unemployed in New York, 37 percent were living in poverty.\n[84] Poverty rates are important to consider because poverty exacerbates other risk factors like access to safe, stable and adequate housing.126 Homelessness for transgender people increased by 88 percent between 2016 and 2019, an increase that is markedly higher than the 11.5 percent increase in homelessness for Americans generally.127 This increase also reflects a period not considered in the Transgender surveys, which were conducted in 2015. I therefore have good reason to infer that the rate of homelessness in the trans community is very high now.\n[85] Ms. B's immigration forms indicate that she has attended a number of different colleges and universities, but she has not completed any degrees.128 Her narrative states that her primary and secondary school education was hampered by bullying and beatings because of her SOGIESC identity,129 and that her post-secondary education was frequently interrupted due to housing and income problems.130\n[86] I note that Ms. B is not wealthy. Although she is well-educated, this has not, historically, translated into reliable and well-paying jobs for her. Her evidence is that she has lost her employment multiple times because of discriminatory practices by her employers. She appears to have almost always lived with roommates, which indicates to me that her income has not been enough to support her independent access to housing. The fact that Ms. B has been subjected to debt collection, lawsuits by former landlords, and her filing for bankruptcy in 2017131 are further evidence of her lack of access to a stable and\/or adequate income. In addition, Ms. B has indicated that, between 2012 and 2013, she was extorted by a roommate and forced to live in homeless shelters in order to avoid the abuse by that roommate and her family members.132 In 2018, after losing her employment, Ms. B lost her apartment as well and had to seek refuge in the homes of others until she was able to get another job that unfortunately only lasted two weeks.133 Her subsequent employment was for similarly short durations.134 I therefore find that Ms. B already has a history of experiencing vulnerability, unstable employment leading to poverty, and homelessness as a result of her trans identity and that this supports a finding that she is at risk of experiencing the same in New York, where she currently does not appear to have any social network supports.\n[87] All of these factors lead me to conclude that Ms. B would be vulnerable in New York City, where the cost of living is terribly high. Even in cheaper neighbourhoods like the Bronx, the risk of violence is high,135 which, given the fact that trans women are more likely to experience violence than cisgender individuals, means that the risks of violence are also much greater.136 Based on the results of the Transgender Survey, I find that reporting these incidents to the police may expose Ms. B to further harassment and discrimination.\n[88] The evidence on discrimination in access to healthcare indicates that Ms. B is likely to encounter some mistreatment while attempting to access healthcare.137 This is concerning because the evidence shows that more than one-quarter of all of the New York respondents to the Transgender Survey indicated that they had not seen a doctor because of fear of being mistreated.138 In fact, 32 percent reported having at least one negative experience related to being transgender in the previous year, including experiences of being refused treatment, getting verbally harassed, being physically or sexually assaulted, or having to teach the provider about transgender people in order to get appropriate care.139 Many survey respondents (28 percent) indicated that they did not seek medical attention because the cost was prohibitive.140 I find echoes of this in Ms. B's narrative since she travelled to Thailand in order to access sex reassignment surgery that she could afford.141\n[89] I am aware that not all medical care in the US has to be paid for privately. Insurance is available through employers and through the government. The evidence indicates that 88 percent of LGBTQ Americans have either private insurance or coverage through government exchange or Medicaid,142 but this number does not mean that the majority of trans individuals in the US have health insurance. According to the Transgender Survey for New York, 26 percent of respondents reported experiencing a problem with their insurance within the previous year, such as being denied coverage for care related to gender transition or being denied coverage for routine care because they were transgender.143 Given this evidence, I find that Ms. B may be denied coverage for routine care by her insurer simply because she is transgender and that this risk increases the burden on her to privately finance her access to care.\n[90] Again, I find that Ms. B's employment and housing history lead to a well-founded inference that, by relocating to New York City, she may be unable to independently afford the costs of medical care that are not covered by insurance. Although she has accessed medical care in the past, I also find that Ms. B would not be immune to the fears or risks of mistreatment by medical practitioners because of her trans status. By relocating, she will, after all, have to find new sources of care when necessary.\n[91] The country documents show that fear and uncertainty around how one will be treated-whether entry, service, or use of bathroom facilities will be denied and whether they will be harassed-affects the way many trans individuals interact with the world and communities around them. These experiences push trans people out of public life by making it difficult or unsafe for them to do everyday things like go to stores, use public transportation, access healthcare and other essential services, or simply go to a restaurant to eat.144 Ms. B's experiences in different states in the US demonstrate that, despite her relative position of privilege as a white woman, she has nevertheless experienced many of the problems described in the evidence on the situation of trans people in the US.\n[92] Considered collectively, I find the evidence shows that trans individuals in New York continue to face high levels of discrimination, harassment and physical violence that affect their ability to live freely and with dignity. I find the evidence also shows that Ms. B would be at a disadvantage in establishing herself since there is no evidence that she has any existing social networks in New York City to help her find the housing and employment necessary for successful integration into the community. I find, for all of the above reasons, that relocation is unreasonable for Ms. B, given her particular profile and circumstances.\n[93] The appeal is allowed. I substitute my own decision that Ms. B is a Convention refugee.\n(signed)\nDilani Mohan\nDilani Mohan\nOctober 27, 2022\nDate\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\nRAD File \/ Dossier de la SAR : VC1-05153\nRAD.25.02 (August 20, 2021)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n2\nImmigration and Refugee\nBoard of Canada\nRefugee Appeal Division\nCommission de l'immigration et du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 du Canada\nSection d'appel des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s\nRAD.25.02 (August 20, 2021)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX (the Appellant), a citizen of the State of Libya appeals a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) denying his claim for refugee protection. He has not submitted new evidence in support of his appeal. The Appellant asks that the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) set aside the decision of the RPD and substitute its own determination that the Appellant is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. In the alternative, the Appellant asks that the matter be referred back to the RPD to a differently-constituted panel.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] Pursuant to Section 111(1) (a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), the RAD confirms the decision of the RPD, that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. This appeal is dismissed.\nBackground\n[3] The Appellant alleged before the RPD that on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014 while driving his pregnant wife to a medical appointment, the Appellant's car was stopped by a group of armed men who had blocked the road. The Appellant and his wife were relieved of their possessions and the Appellant's car was taken by the men. The Appellant reported the incident to the police who directed him to file a complaint with the Tripoli Military Council (TMC). The TMC after conducting an investigation arrested three men in connection with the robbery of the Appellant and his wife.\n[4] On XXXX XXXX, 2014 the Appellant was contacted by the Al-Zintan militia advising him to withdraw his complaint against the three men. The Appellant agreed to do that if they returned his car, as his belongings had been returned to him earlier by the TMC when they arrested the men. The Appellant also alleges that the militia threatens to rape his wife if he didn't comply with their demand. The Appellant further alleges that his shop was showered by gun fire, which resulted in the injury of a customer, and later that day it was fire bombed. The Appellant and his wife fled to a friend's house, but were found by the militia a short time later.\n[5] The Appellant and his Canadian born wife fled Libya on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014 en route to Canada via Ireland, and arriving on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014. A short time later, the Appellant filed a claim for refugee protection inland.\n[6] The Appellant's application for refugee protection was heard on December 10, 2014 and January 29, 2015. In a written decision dated April 21, 2015, the RPD rejected the claim, finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. The RPD found that the Appellant was not a credible witness as his testimony was not trustworthy regarding the essential elements of his claim for refugee protection.1\n[7] The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in its credibility findings.\nROLE OF THE RAD\n[8] Appellant's counsel has made submissions in this regard to the role that the RAD plays in the review of an RPD decision which is consistent with the recent Federal Court decision in Huruglica.2 The RAD finds that the Huruglica3 decision provides the RAD with guidance in relation to the appropriate standard that must be applied by a specialized tribunal such as the RAD to decisions of a first-level administrative tribunal.\n[9] Justice Phelan states in paragraphs 54 and 55 of the foregoing decision:\n[54] Having concluded that the RAD erred in reviewing the RPD's decision on the standard of reasonableness, I have further concluded that for the reasons above, the RAD is required to conduct a hybrid appeal. It must review all aspects of the RPD's decision and come to an independent assessment of whether the claimant is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. Where its assessment departs from that of the RPD, the RAD must substitute its own decision.\n[55] In conducting its assessment, it can recognize and respect the conclusion of the RPD on such issues as credibility and\/or where the RPD enjoys a particular advantage in reaching such a conclusion but it is not restricted, as an appellate court is, to intervening on facts only where there is an \"overriding and palpable error.\"\n[10] Accordingly, the RAD will conduct its own assessment of the RPD's decision and come to an independent assessment of whether the Appellant is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. The RAD will recognize and respect the credibility findings of the RPD or other findings where the RPD has a particular advantage in arriving at its conclusions.\nANALYSIS OF THE MERITS OF THE APPEAL\nDid the RPD err in its credibility findings?\n[11] The Appellant argues that the RPD erred when it determined there was a contradiction between the testimony of the Appellant and his wife regarding who accompanied them to the military council. The Appellant argues that the reasons for decision state that the Appellant testified he was accompanied by six brothers, but his wife who was a witness at the RPD hearing, testified that she was not sure but thought it was only one brother.4 The Appellant argues that the question posed by the RPD was ambiguous one capable of two interpretations. The question, \"who accompanied you to the military council?\" can be understood in two ways. Either as, \"who travelled with you to get to the military council building from the police station?\" Or it can mean, \"who accompanied you inside of the military council office when you went to make the complaint?\"5\n[12] The RAD disagrees with the Appellant's argument. The RPD provided detailed findings in its reasons. The RAD listened to the audio in regards to this specific argument and ironically found that it was the Appellant who is microscopic in his argument as opposed to the RPD as he alleges. The question which was posed to the Appellant by the RPD was actually, \"so, they all accompanied you to the military council?\"6 Prior to that to put things into context, the following exchange to place. The Panel asked, \"and how did you go to the military council?\"7 The Appellant responded, \"they transferred me and gave me a paper, and told me to go to the military council.\"8 The Panel asked,\" how did you go to the military council?\"9 The Panel, \"by what means?\"10 The Appellant responded, \" I called my brothers from the police station and they came and took me by car.\"11 The Panel asked, which brothers?\"12 The Appellant testified, \" all my brothers came in that moment.\"13 The Panel asked, \" how many?\"14 The Appellant testified, \"all my brothers came.\"15 The Panel asked, \"how many do you have?\"16 The Appellant testified, \"six brothers\"17 The Panel asked, \"so they accompanied you to the military council?\"18 The Appellant testified, \"yes\".19 The RAD found nothing ambiguous about the question, and found that the Appellant had no problem in answering the question. His answer was very clear. The RAD finds this argument put forth by the Appellant to be un-supportable and therefore it fails.\n[13] The Appellant further argues that during his wife's testimony, the member's question was also ambiguous regarding, who accompanied them to the military council. The RAD listened to the audio which included the exchange between the Panel and the Appellant's testimony. The questions put to the Appellant's wife were very clear, and they Appellant wife's testimony was very clear. The RAD found there was no ambiguity in the questioning,20 but inconsistencies between the Appellant's and his witness's (his wife) testimony as pointed out in the reasons by the RPD. The RAD finds this argument put forth by the Appellant to be without merit and as such it too fails.\nDocuments from the Tripoli Military Council\n[14] The Appellant argues that the RPD erred by choosing to give no weight to the documents from the Tripoli Military Council (TMC), because the letters did not specifically mention the Zintan group as the members of an \"armed gang.\"21 The RAD has reviewed the report from the TMC and it notes that throughout the entire report there is no mention of the Al- Zintan group, only the term \"armed gang\" is used. The RAD finds that it would be realistic for the TMC to name the Al-Zintan in the report, if indeed they were responsible. Throughout the NDP, there is substantial documentary evidence which shows the strength and the position the Al-Zintan holds throughout Libya. The RAD notes that the Appellant himself indicates in his Basis of Claim (BoC), The Zintan Militia is now very powerful. They attacked and destroyed the Tripoli airport.22 It would therefore be reasonable to find that the TMC would have named the group by the actual name, as opposed to \"armed gang\", especially when they had three of the gang members in custody.\n[15] The RPD clearly stated in its reasons that the Appellant's general credibility had been undermined and that the allegations made by the Appellant caused his claim for refugee protection to have been weakened. The RAD finds that, given the significant credibility findings, it was open to the RPD to assign the appropriate weight to these documents, and further that they do not overcome the totality of the adverse credibility findings in the absence of further corroborative proof. The RAD noted that when it assessed these documents, none of documents provided any corroborative or independent evidence of the Appellant's allegations. The RAD is not persuaded by this argument that has been put forth by the Appellant, as it does not find it supportable and, therefore, the Appellant's argument fails.\n[16] The RAD notes that all persons, whether they are claimants, Appellants and especially counsels are very aware that credibility, which certainly includes supporting documents, is always an issue at every hearing. The Appellant was represented by competent counsel who ought to have known that the Appellant's documents would be assessed by the presiding member and that the documents would be given the appropriate weight according to their relevance and credibility.\n[17] The Appellant submits that, as a result of his testimony, in which he testified in a manner which was consistent with the narrative in his Basis of Claim form (BoC), that the RPD credibility findings were marginal without regard for the record. The Appellant provides some examples.\n[18] Given the evidence in the record, the RAD finds the RPD findings on credibility to be supportable in this area of the evidence. The RAD, upon review of the audio of the hearing, finds that there was sufficient reason for the RPD to find the Appellant's testimony not credible.\n[19] In regards to the credibility findings by the RPD, the RAD recognizes and respects those findings.\nSUMMARY AND DETERMINATION\n[20] The RAD finds that the RPD's credibility findings were thorough and are supported by the evidence and, as a result of those findings; the RAD affords deference to those findings. The RAD also finds, on a balance of probabilities, that evidence on the record is abundant to support the RPD's overall determination. The RAD finds that, after conducting an independent assessment on the evidence before it in its entirety, it arrived at the same conclusion as did the RPD in its overall determination. The RAD further finds that the Appellant has not satisfied his burden of establishing a serious possibility that he would be persecuted or that he would be personally subjected to a risk to his life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture by any authority in Libya.\nDISPOSITION\n[21] Pursuant to Section 111(1) (a) of IRPA, the RAD confirms the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. This appeal is, therefore, dismissed.\n(signed)\n\"Luis F. Agostinho\"\nLuis F.

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX (the Appellant) is appealing the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) denying his claim for refugee protection. He has submitted new evidence in support of his appeal; however, he is not requesting that the Refugee Appeal Division conduct an oral hearing. The Appellant is, however, asking the RAD to allow the appeal.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] This appeal is allowed. Pursuant to sections 111(1)(c) and 111(2) of the IRPA, the RAD refers this matter back to the RPD for re-determination by a differently constituted panel.\nBackground\n[3] The Appellant is a 23-year old Somalian National who alleges to be from the Sheikhal clan. He grew up in Mogadishu and he alleges that his family was running a business trading foreign products.\n[4] The Appellant alleges that his family's business as attacked by Al-Shabaab, killing both his father and brother on XXXX XXXX, 2015. He also alleges that his family was targeted by Al-Shabaab because they were Sufi practitioners. The Appellant managed to flee to Kenya on XXXX XXXX, 2015, then to Canada on October 2, 2015 with the aid of a smuggler to facilitate his journey.\nROLE OF THE RAD\n[5] Counsel for the Appellant concurs that the RAD should take guidance from the recent Federal Court of Appeal decision, in Huruglica.1 This decision provides us with guidance in relation to the appropriate standard that must be applied by a specialized tribunal such as the RAD to decisions of a first-level administrative tribunal. The justices stated at paragraph 103:\n[103] I conclude from my statutory analysis that with respect to findings of fact (and mixed fact and law) such as the one involved here, which raised no issue of credibility of oral evidence, the RAD is to review RPD decisions applying the correctness standard. Thus, after carefully considering the RPD decision, the RAD carries out its own analysis of the record to determine whether, as submitted by the appellant, the RPD erred. Having done this, the RAD is to provide a final determination, either by confirming the RPD decision or setting it aside and substituting its own determination of the merits of the refugee claim. It is only when the RAD is of the opinion that it cannot provide such a final determination without hearing the oral evidence presented to the RPD that the matter can be referred back to the RPD for redetermination. No other interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions is reasonable.\nThe RAD has applied the foregoing reasoning.\nADMISSIBILITY OF NEW EVIDENCE PRESENTED ON APPEAL\nExpress statutory conditions\n[6] Section 110(4) of the IRPA provides that the Appellant may present only evidence that arose after the rejection of her claim or that was not reasonably available, or that she could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection.\n[7] The following new evidence has been submitted:\n* Documents from the Somali Immigrant Aid Organization (SIAO) website;2\n* Law Society of Kenya online excerpt.3\n[8] Counsel submits that the new evidence concerning the SIAO is credible and is verifiable from the website and it is relevant as it demonstrates the bona fides of the SIAO as well as demonstrates that the SIAO has provided assistance to Somali newcomers for many years. It is argued that it was not reasonably foreseeable that the RPD would impugn a reputable community organization and the bona fides of a Kenyan lawyer.\n[9] It is further argued that the Raza4 criteria of \"credibility\", \"newness\", and relevance\" of the evidence has been met.\n[10] The RAD finds, with respect to the documentation from the Somali Immigration Aid Organization, that this is not new evidence. Our analysis follows with respect to this document which was before the RPD. Accordingly, the RAD declines to admit it.\n[11] However, with respect to the Law Society of Kenya online excerpt, the RAD accepts this document as the Appellant could not reasonably have expected that the lawyer's credentials would be challenged. Accordingly, the RAD admits this document.\n[12] Section 110(6) of the IRPA states:\nThe Refugee Appeal Division may hold a hearing if, in its opinion, there is documentary evidence referred to in subsection (3)\n(a) that raises a serious issue with respect to the credibility of the person who is the subject of the appeal;\n(b) that is central to the decision with respect to the refugee protection claim; and\n(c) that, if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the refugee protection claim.\n[13] The RAD finds that the new admissible evidence does not establish the Appellant's identity, which was the determinative issue of the Appellant's claim.\nSUBMISSIONS BY THE APPELLANT\n* Did the RPD err in its \"identity\" findings?\nFirst witness XXXX XXXX XXXX\n[14] It is argued that the RPD made an error of fact when it could not accept that the witness and the Appellant would not have known each other until 2010, if they had lived two houses apart. It is argued that the Appellant did not say that he lived two houses away from the witness; neither did the witness. It is submitted that the RPD speculated in part because of the proximity of the house, which is an error, and because of \"the strong sense of community in Somalia.\"5 The answers provided by both the Appellant and the witness, it is submitted, are consistent. For example, they met at the mosque before 2010, and they played soccer after going to the mosque, the Appellant named the members of the witness' family including the witness' wife and stated that they had no children. The Appellant described the shop of the witness after 2014, when it became a sports good store.\n[15] The RAD concurs with the Appellant that it would not be uncommon or unusual for individuals who lived two doors apart, not to know each other until they met in certain circumstances, which appears to be the case in this claim. Moreover, the RAD finds that the conclusions reached by the RPD are speculative in nature as a result on this issue. As well, the comment about the \"strong sense of community\" in Somalia is pure conjecture as well.\nSecond witness XXXX XXXX XXXX\n[16] The Appellant stated that this witness was a driver and picked up goods that were stored on the Appellant's father's business premises. The RPD erred in that it was microscopic to find that this witness was not credible because he said the father's truck was a red Isuzu at the second sitting and the Appellant had said that the truck was a Fiat at the first sitting. The Appellant testified that his family business had had one truck before and then they got another truck (first sitting). It was never put to the Appellant which truck he was referring to when he referred to the Fiat. It is submitted that the second witness should not be impugned because of the fact that the witness said that the truck was an Isuzu, which is microscopic and also because the evidence is that there was one truck that was sold before the Appellant met the second witness and the Appellant may have been referring to the first truck when he said that truck was a Fiat.\n[17] The RPD pointed out that the witness and the Appellant differed as to whether they had met at the Tim Horton's.\n[18] The RAD finds that this issue was never put to the Appellant and given the fact that one truck was sold before the Appellant met this second witness, the finding by the RPD is unsustainable.\nOther discrepancies\n[19] It is submitted that the finding by the RPD that the appellant had embellished his evidence with respect to discrimination at the hands of majority tribes, when he had not referred to such discrimination at the first sitting, is unreasonable. It is argued that this is not relevant to the determination issue which is identity.\n[20] It is argued that the RPD impugned the Appellant's evidence because he did not mention in his Basis of Claim (BOC) problems with Al-Shabaab in October 2009 and April 2010. It is submitted by the Appellant that these incidents were minor and were not related to the June 2015 incident and were five to six years prior to that incident. Moreover, it is argued that when asked about further incidents, the Appellant elaborated, but that did not mean that he would necessarily have added these incidents to his BOC. It is argued that the RPD's point of view that it was important to refer to the incidents in 2009 and 2010 in his BOC is unreasonable.\n[21] Furthermore, it is submitted by the Appellant that the RPD erred in finding that the letter from the SIAO could not be given weight because it had no credentials. Had notice been given, the Appellant could have referred to the information on their website at http:\/\/www.siao.ca.\n[22] Furthermore, it is submitted that the RPD discusses the affidavit from his mother but assigns no weight because it is a copy. Moreover, the advocate who swore the affidavit is listed online. With respect to the affidavit of the grandfather, in the absence of proof of the notary and no identity documents for the signatories, the RPD assigned no weight. However, it is argued that this was not raised at the hearing and, therefore, is a breach of fairness.\n[23] The RAD finds that the RPD ought to have given weight to the letter from the SIAO as it is an official organization. The advocate who wrote the affidavit from the Appellant's mother is listed online, and the RAD has accepted this as new evidence. The RAD further notes that the affidavit of the grandfather, and the doubts with respect to its authenticity were never put to the Appellant.\n[24] The RAD finds that the foregoing are errors in law and are, therefore, unsustainable.\n[25] It is submitted that the RPD accepted that identity documents have not been issued in Somalia since 1991. The Appellant submits that the RAD must then have regard to the totality of alternative forms of evidence produced by him in order to establish his identity.\nRAD'S CONCLUSION\n[26] The RAD finds that it cannot conduct an analysis with respect to the merits of the claim. To do so would require hearing evidence which was already before the RPD. The RAD has already declined an oral hearing, as the new evidence does not meet the criteria pursuant to ss. 110(6) of the IRPA. Accordingly, the RAD remits the matter to a newly constituted panel of the RPD for re-determination with respect to both the issue of identity and the merits of the claim.\n[27] This appeal is allowed. Pursuant to sections 111(1)(c) and 111(2) of the IRPA, the RAD refers this matter back to the RPD for re-determination by a differently constituted panel.\n(signed)\n\"Roslyn Ahara\"\nRoslyn Ahara\nSeptember 21, 2016\nDate\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD.25.02 (June 23, 2014)\nRAD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SAR : TB6-05859\n",

The appeal is dismissed.\nBACKGROUND\n[3] The Appellant alleges that she informed her parents and siblings that she would like to convert to Islam on her last visit to the Philippines. She told her very conservative and devoted Catholic family that she did not want to celebrate Christmas. Her father threatened that, if she did not celebrate Christmas, he would beat her and kick her out of the house. The Appellant was forced to celebrate Christmas. She decided when leaving the Philippines that she would never return because of her family. The Appellant studied Islam for almost one year and learned the Arabic language to study the Quran. She converted to Islam in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2013. She told her parents of her conversion to Islam, and her father told her that he would kill her if she returned because she has brought shame to her family and to Christianity. The Appellant alleges that her brother said the same to her. The Appellant alleges that if she returns to the Philippines, she will be killed by her family because of her conversion to Islam. She will also be mistreated by her friends and relatives.\n[4] In its reasons, the RPD found that the Appellant was not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. The RPD made the following findings:\n1. The panel noted inconsistent evidence with respect to how she was threatened. Her inconsistent evidence concerning her family's reaction undermines her credibility.\n2. The Appellant did not know the name of the priest of the Catholic Church she attended. Her testimony in this regard detracts from her credibility.\n3. The Appellant alleges that she received various threats from her family over the telephone, and her inconsistent evidence in this regard detracts from her credibility.\n4. The panel gave little weight to the letter from the Appellant's mother in terms of establishing her allegations.\n5. The panel accepted the Appellant is a Muslim.\n6. The panel was not persuaded that there is clear and convincing evidence that the Philippines would not be reasonably forthcoming with adequate state protection to protect the Appellant should she return to the Philippines.\n[5] The Appellant submitted an appeal of the negative determination on July 22, 2013.\n[6] The Minister did not intervene in this appeal.\n[7] In the appeal, the Appellant made the following submissions:\n1. The panel member made the following errors in refusing the Applicant's claim for refugee protection:\na) By drawing an adverse inference of credibility as to whether her family threatened to kill her because she had converted to Islam; and\nb) By failing to assess state protection from the perspective of the Applicant's gender.\n[8] The Appellant is requesting that the Refugee Appeal Division set aside the RPD's decision and asks that a new hearing be ordered pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(c) of the IRPA.\n[9] The Appellant did not provide any new evidence in support of her appeal.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n[10] The Appellant submits that the RPD made errors in its treatment of credibility and state protection. The alleged errors concern credibility and negative inferences which are errors of fact. The RPD's assessment of the evidence and application of law, on the matter of state protection, is a question of mixed fact and law.\n[11] The Appellant did not make any submissions on the issue of the standard of review.\n[12] Although IRPA sets out grounds for appeal as well as possible remedies, it does not specify the standard of review to be applied by the RAD.\n[13] In assessing and selecting the appropriate standard of review for findings of fact, the RAD considered the factors outlined in Newton v. Criminal Trial Lawyers' Association,1 which take into account the list of factors in Dunsmuir.2 The Newton factors include:\na) the respective roles of the tribunal of first instance and the appellate tribunal, as determined by interpreting the enabling legislation;\nb) the nature of the question in issue;\nc) the interpretation of the statute as a whole;\nd) the expertise and advantageous position of the tribunal of first instance, compared to that of the appellate tribunal;\ne) the need to limit the number, length and cost of appeals;\nf) preserving the economy and integrity of the proceedings in the tribunal of first instance; and\ng) other factors that are relevant in the particular context.\n[14] The Newton factors deal with the standard of review to be applied by an appellate administrative tribunal to the decision of an administrative tribunal of first instance, and, as such, these factors are very relevant to the relationship between the RPD and the RAD. Based on the guidance in Newton, the RAD focused on the factors listed below to determine the standard of review. The Supreme Court of Canada, in Khosa,3 noted that the factors in deciding the standard of review are not a checklist of criteria: a contextualized approach is appropriate in deciding which factors are most relevant. In assessing the relationship between the RAD and the RPD with respect to the Newton factors, the RAD considered the following three most significant factors:\n* the respective roles of the RPD and the RAD in the context of IRPA;\n* the expertise and advantageous position of the RPD member compared to that of the RAD; and\n* the nature of the question in issue.\n[15] Both the RPD and the RAD derive their jurisdiction from and interpret the same statute: the Immigration and Protection Act. Section 162 of IRPA gives each Division the same powers, including the Refugee Protection Division, \"in respect of proceedings brought before it under this Act, sole and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine all questions of law and fact, including questions of jurisdiction.\" With respect to the respective roles of the RPD and the RAD in the context of IRPA, the powers of each Division are the same although their roles are not the same. It is the primary role of the RPD to hear testimony, review evidence and determine a claim on its merits, while generally the RAD reviews those determinations based on questions of law, fact or mixed fact and law. However, the fact that the RAD may, where appropriate, substitute a different determination than that made by the RPD does make its role similar to the RPD in that each Division is engaged in refugee determination.\n[16] The RAD decides appeals of RPD decisions related to refugee protection on questions of law, of fact, or of mixed law and fact;4 however, the presence of a right of appeal in and of itself does not warrant a correctness standard of review given the proscribed relationship between the RPD and the RAD, and the limits imposed on the RAD in IRPA highlighted below.\n[17] The RPD is a tribunal of first instance which has been given the authority in IRPA to make a decision to accept or reject a claim for protection.5 RPD members have expertise in interpreting and applying IRPA and as well are experts in assessing claims based on country conditions. The RPD must conduct a hearing6 and assess the totality of the evidence, including evidence related to the credibility of the Appellant and witnesses, after it has had an opportunity to see the claimants, hear their testimony and question them. The RPD has expertise in making findings of fact after evaluating, first hand, the testimony of witnesses.\n[18] In contrast to the RPD's authority to assess a claim for protection, IRPA limits the RAD's ability to consider evidence. The RAD is not a tribunal of first instance but exists to review the decision made by the RPD and review a decision in light of new evidence. The RAD must proceed without a hearing on the basis of the record, submissions by the parties, and new evidence.7 The RAD's authority to consider new evidence and hold hearings is limited to evidence, in most cases, that arose after the rejection of the claim or that was not reasonably available, or that the person could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection.8 Oral hearings are limited to circumstances where the new evidence raises a serious credibility issue.9\n[19] Given that the RPD has held a hearing on the totality of the evidence and given that the RPD has heard from the Appellant directly at a hearing, and given that the RAD's authority to consider new evidence in this case is limited in IRPA, the RPD is in the best position to assess the credibility of the Appellant and to make findings on issues of fact, and mixed law and fact related to the claim. This position is consistent with Newton, at paragraph 82, where it indicates with respect to the appellate division that: \"The Board is not a tribunal of first instance, and cannot simply ignore the proceedings before the presiding officer, and the conclusions reached by him\".10\n[20] Newton concludes that: \"a decision on such questions of fact by the presiding officer, as the tribunal of first instance, are entitled to deference. Unless the findings of fact are unreasonable, the Board should not interfere\".11 Newton adopts the definition of \"reasonableness\" in Dunsmuir. Reasonableness is concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process of the RPD and that the RPD's decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law.12\n[21] For these reasons, the RAD concludes that, in considering this appeal, it must show deference to the factual and credibility findings of the RPD, as well as to its findings on matters of mixed fact and law. The notion of deference to administrative tribunal decision-making requires a respectful attention to the reasons offered in support of the decision made. Even if the reasons do not seem wholly adequate to support the decision, the RAD must first seek to supplement them before it substitutes its own decision.13\n[22] In the case at hand, the Appellant alleges that the RPD made errors of fact and mixed fact and law. As such, the nature of the question at issue is one of fact. Given the analysis above, the RAD therefore has afforded a considerable level of deference to RPD findings on questions of facts and mixed fact and law in this claim and will consider whether the findings meet the reasonableness test.\nANALYSIS OF THE MERITS OF THE APPEAL\n[23] The RAD focused on the issues: 1) Did the RPD err in an adverse inference of credibility as to whether her family threatened to kill her because she had converted to Islam? 2) Did the RPD fail to assess state protection from the perspective of the Applicant's gender?\nThreats from Family\n[24] The RPD, in its reasons, states that the Appellant's Basis of Claim (BoC) form provides that when she expressed interest in Islam on the XXXX XXXX XXXX, 2011, her father threatened to beat her and kick her out of the house. The panel noted inconsistent evidence with respect to how the Appellant was threatened by her family and gave her the opportunity to explain the discrepancy. The Appellant responded that her family told her that, if she converted to Islam, they would kill her. The panel did not accept her explanation because it does not address the inconsistency but merely reiterated her oral evidence, without explaining why her BoC provides something different. The panel determined the Appellant's inconsistent evidence concerning her family's reaction as noted undermines her credibility. The RPD found, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant did not receive the threats of harm at the hands of her family as she alleges.\n[25] The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in drawing an adverse inference of credibility as to whether her family threatened to kill her because she had converted to Islam.\n[26] The RPD is correct in that at Question 2(a) of the BoC, the Appellant stated that, \"my father threatened that if I did not celebrate (Christmas) with them, he will beat me up and kick me out of the house.\" However, the RAD notes at Question 2(a) of the BoC that the Appellant clearly states, \"...my father told me he will kill me if I return because I brought shame to the family and to Christianity.\" The Appellant stated at Question (b), \"my family will kill me if I go back because my conversion to Islam.\" Additionally, at Question 2(d), the Appellant stated, \"I did not return to Philippines after my conversion to Islam because I will be killed and harmed by my relatives and family members.\"\n[27] The RAD finds the Appellant clearly stated in her BoC form that her relatives and family members would kill her and not only that, her father would beat her and \"kick her\" out of the house. The RAD finds the RPD panel member erred in its finding of fact related to the Appellant's credibility, as it failed to consider evidence on the record regarding the death threats in its interpretation of the evidence provided by the Appellant in her BoC form. Therefore, the RPD's finding that the inconsistent evidence concerning her family's reaction undermines the Appellant's credibility is not reasonable in that it was not defensible in respect of the facts. In addition, the RAD finds the RPD's finding that the Appellant did not receive the threats of harm at the hands of her family, as she alleges, is unreasonable and cannot stand.\nState Protection\n[28] The RPD, despite its finding that the Appellant did not receive the threats of harm at the hands of her family, as she alleged, accepted that the Appellant is a Muslim and then entered into an analysis of the entirety of the documentary evidence related to the issue of state protection.\n[29] The RPD, on the totality of the evidence and after considering all of the documentary and oral evidence, including counsel's submissions, was not persuaded that there is clear and convincing evidence that the Philippines would not be reasonably forthcoming with adequate state protection to protect the Appellant should she return to the Philippines. While states are presumed to be capable of protecting their nationals, it was open to the Appellant in this case, according to the law, to rebut the presumption with clear and convincing evidence. The panel found, upon a review of the evidence as a whole, the Appellant had not rebutted that presumption.\n[30] The Appellant, in her pleadings, states that the RPD erred by failing to assess state protection from the perspective of her gender. It is submitted that the panel ought to have conducted its analysis from a gender perspective because in this case, the Applicant, a female, would have to seek protection against her father. Thus, the panel ought to have considered the effectiveness of state protection for a female seeking protection in the context of familial violence.\n[31] The Appellant also argues that, by looking at the state protection issue solely based on religion, the panel failed to consider evidence that was pertinent to the state protection issue and thus led it to make erroneous findings, as it pertained to whether the police would take an interest in the family issue and therefore erred in its consideration of state protection.\n[32] The Appellant, in her pleadings, points to documentary evidence14 and argues that this evidence corroborates the evidence at her RPD hearing that the police would not get involved because it was a family problem, that is they would have pushed the case towards reconciliation as opposed to providing the Applicant adequate protection.\n[33] The RAD reviewed the documentary evidence15 highlighted by the Appellant and notes that it does mention police insensitivity by advising women in situations of violence to reconcile with their partners, that there is a shortage of staff to handle cases involving women and efforts to improve officials' gender sensitivity and understanding of the law have not been \"systematic and comprehensive.\"\n[34] The RPD considered that the Appellant did not seek state protection and the Appellant's explanation for not seeking state protection. The Appellant testified that she did not contact the police when her father threatened her because she did not want her father to go to prison. The Appellant stated in her BoC at Question 2(c), \"The police will not intervene in family affairs (e)specially in my small city XXXX.\" \"I cannot also go to the police to put my parents and my brother in jail.\" \"It is against my culture and tradition.\" The RPD determined that the Appellant's own evidence provides that not only in her opinion would the police assist in such a family matter, but they would take steps to punish any perpetrators. The RPD noted that doubting the effectiveness of the protection offered by the state when one has not really tested it does not rebut the presumption of state protection. Moreover, the police cannot be faulted for not offering protection, where incidents are not reported to them. The RAD notes that no evidence was presented by the Appellant that she would risk her life by accessing state protection. The RAD finds the failure to seek protection, especially after death threats, where the state is a functioning democracy with a willingness and apparatus necessary to provide a measure of protection to its citizens, a failure to pursue state protection opportunities within the home state will usually be fatal to a refugee claim.16\n[35] The RPD considered that, even if the state's efforts are not always successful, this does not rebut the presumption of state protection. State protection does not have to be perfect, with the applicable standard being whether the police make serious efforts to protect its citizens.\n[36] The RPD determined that the Appellant did not receive the threats of harm at the hands of her family as she alleged. This finding has been found to be unreasonable by the RAD. The RPD did not look at state protection for the Appellant based on her gender or her family relationship but turned its mind and assessed the situation of Muslims in the Philippines. The RPD based this assessment on the Appellant's own evidence that not only in her opinion would the police assist in such a family matter, but they would take steps to punish any perpetrators. The RAD finds the RPD's assessment of state protection for the Appellant because of her religion and not because of her gender or family relationship to be justified and reasonable.\n[37] The availability of state protection must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. The RAD has reviewed the RPD's reasons in light of this issue. The RPD correctly stated that the onus was on the Appellant to provide clear and convincing evidence of the state's inability to protect her.17 The RPD did not find her fear of her family to be credible, and the panel went on to assess the level of democracy in the Philippines, its state protection systems and the situation of Muslims in the Philippines.\n[38] The RAD finds that the RPD's decision considered a contextual approach to assessing state protection for Muslims in the Philippines and whether or not the Appellant has rebutted the presumption of state protection, as per Gonzales Torres.18 The RPD is not required to refer to each document in evidence when assessing the adequacy of state protection.19\n[39] It is clear that the RPD turned its mind to the relevant considerations in relation to assessing the adequacy of state protection for the Appellant, as a Muslim in the Philippines. The RPD's finding that there was adequate state protection was transparent and the findings were justified by the evidence. The RPD reached a conclusion that falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes defensible in respect of the facts and the law. It was for the Appellant to provide clear and convincing evidence of the state's inability to protect, and the RPD reasonably found that neither the Appellant's personal evidence nor the objective evidence was a clear and convincing rebuttal of the presumption of state protection. For these reasons, the RAD finds the RPD's finding regarding state protection was reasonable. Therefore, the RPD's findings were afforded a high level of deference, as per Dunsmuir.20 As the RAD has confirmed the RPD's finding on state protection, this is sufficient to dispose of the appeal. The RPD's determination should not be disturbed.\nDETERMINATION\n[40] Based on the analysis above, the RAD confirms the determination of the RPD's decision as per s. 111(1)(a) of IRPA that the Appellant is not a Convention refugee, nor is she a person in need of protection. The appeal is dismissed.\n(signed)\n\"C. Forbes\"\nC.

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX, (the Appellant), is a citizen of China. The Appellant appeals the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) decision of March 7, 2016, that he is not a Convention refugee. The RPD found, on a balance of probabilities, that there is not more than a mere possibility that the Appellant would be persecuted for a Convention ground, or that he is likely to be subjected personally to a risk to his life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] Pursuant to section 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) confirms the decision of the RPD and dismisses the appeal.\nMemorandum of Appeal\n[3] The Appellant requests that the RAD set aside the RPD's determination in this matter and substitute a determination that the Appellant is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection, or alternatively, grant an order referring this matter back to RPD for re-determination.\nBackground\n[4] The Appellant alleges that he afraid of being persecuted in China due to his underground house church Christianity activities.\n[5] Being unable to receive relief from medical practitioners due to pain and swelling in his right elbow joint, the Appellant joined a house church in China on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2015. The Appellant was assured that many safety precautions had been done to avoid discovery by the authorities.\n[6] The Appellant described the current degree by other church members, and described the service being held in the basement of one of the member's homes. In XXXX 2015, he heard that the local government was going to crackdown on illegal house churches. As a result he stopped attending the church service.\n[7] After hearing, in XXXX 2015, that a member of his church had been taken away by the Public Security Bureau (PSB) for questioning, he arranged for a smuggler to assist him in coming to Canada. The Appellant has found a church in Canada and has started to attend Sunday service.\n[8] The Appellant fears that he may be arrested in the future due to his involvement in the house church in China.\nROLE OF THE RAD\n[9] The Appellant made no submissions on the standard of review. The decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in Huruglica1 provides guidance in relation to the appropriate standard that must be applied by a specialized tribunal such as the RAD, to decisions of the first level administrative tribunal.\n[10] The Court stated that with respect to findings of fact (and mixed fact and law) which raise no issue of credibility of oral evidence, the RAD is to review RPD decisions by applying the correctness standard. Pursuant to s. 111(2)(b) of the IRPA, the RAD may refer the matter back to the RPD for redetermination if it is \"of the opinion\" that it cannot make a decision confirming or setting aside the RPD decision without hearing the evidence presented before the RPD. This recognizes that there may be cases where the RPD enjoys a meaningful advantage over the RAD in making findings of fact or mixed fact and law, because those cases require an assessment of credibility or weight to be given to the oral evidence it hears. It further indicates that although the RAD should sometimes exercise a degree of restraint before substituting its own determination, the issue of whether the circumstances warrant such restraint ought to be addressed on a case-by-case basis.\n[11] Accordingly, the RAD will conduct its assessment of the RPD's decision on the basis of the principles outlined above.\nMerits of the Appeal\nChristianity in China\nEvidence related to the arrest of a fellow worshipper and pursuit by the authorities\n[12] The RPD found that the Appellant's testimony regarding the circumstances of being wanted by the authorities in China was confusing. The Appellant stated he knew he was wanted by the authorities in China because one of his fellow believers was arrested, and he was a friend. However, in questioning, the Appellant did not go into hiding, even though a friend called and told him to do so, and not to contact anyone by phone. The Appellant testified that he stayed at home until his departure for Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2015, and was not bothered by the authorities. He further testified he thinks the authorities are interested in him because after the incident, all the church members went into hiding. His explanation for not going into hiding was because his introducer who he claims is \"above\" him was in hiding. Reasoned that if he was safe then he would be safe.\n[13] The RPD drew a negative credibility inference, and found based on the Appellant's testimony and behaviour, that he is not of interest to authorities based on any religious activity. The RPD further stated that his fear of authorities was speculative, given that he stayed home for four months without encountering any problems from the authorities. The RPD reasoned that the Appellant did not hide from the authorities, and he believed himself to be safe from them as demonstrated by his behaviour after learning that a fellow worshiper had been arrested.\n[14] The Appellant submits that the RPD did not consider, analyze, and find on the evidence relating to the arrest of the worshipers from the Appellant's congregation. The arrest of his fellow church member was at the heart of the claim. The Appellant submits that the panel erred in failing to address this issue. The Appellant submits Federal jurisprudence to support this submission.2\n[15] The Appellant respectfully submits that the RPD considered and made a finding that the Appellant was not being pursued by the authorities. He reasoned that he did not allege that he was being pursued by the authorities and therefore it was erroneous for the RPD to undertake an analysis of this question. The Appellant respectfully submits that the question of whether the Appellant is being pursued by authorities only arises where the Appellant has alleged that he is being pursued by the authorities, or where he believed that he was being pursued by the authorities.3 The Appellant quoted Federal jurisprudence to support this submission.4\n[16] After listening to the RPD recording of the hearing, the RAD concurs with the RPD's reasoning. The Appellant's reasoning that he was wanted for arrest by Chinese authorities is not substantiated by his behaviour. He testified that he remained at home until he left China, and reasoned that if his introducer was safe, he would be safe as well. No evidence was presented regarding the alleged arrest of the fellow worshiper. The RAD find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant's allegations of being wanted by the authorities in China for the practice of underground church activities, is not credible.\n[17] In the Basis of Claim (BOC) narrative of the Appellant,5 he indicated that he is afraid of being persecuted in China due to his underground Christian activities. Part of the basis of any refugee claim is fear of persecution or that it is likely that the subject would be subjected personally to a risk to his life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture. No probative evidence was submitted that the Appellant was pursued and\/ or sought by Chinese authorities for the practice of his religion. The RAD finds that such a finding by the RPD was in concert with the reasons why one would grant refugee status. This question is critical when assessing a person's status as a Convention refugee, or person in need of protection. As stated above, there was no viable evidence or testimony that indicated he was or is in danger from any Chinese authority.\nReligious Identity\n[18] The RPD stated that the Appellant's reason for not joining the state sanctioned church in China, was that one first had to believe in the Chinese Communist Party, which violates the first rule in the 10 Commandments that states there is only one God. The RPD quoted documentary evidence6 that states that legal Christian congregations in China are not required to pledge their loyalty to country above God. As a result, the RPD found that the Appellant was incorrect in his assertion that legal churches in China are forced to put the Chinese Communist Party over God.\n[19] The Appellant was asked to talk about the Pentecost, and responded by singing a hymn. When asked again by the RPD about the Pentecost, he asked for tips, a request that was refused by the RPD. When the Appellant was asked again, he stated after a long pause, \"our Jesus Christ and the Church founded them. I don't remember the rest of it.\" The RPD found that the Appellant was unable to answer a specific question about the Pentecostal Church and the Pentecost. The RPD also found that the Appellant's religious knowledge was basic and could be obtained by attending a four-week course in Canada that he testified that he attended.\n[20] The Appellant submits that the RPD misapprehended his evidence in suggesting that he stated that he would be required to \"pledge loyalty\" to the Chinese Communist Party if he joined a state sanctioned church China. He states that he testified he would need to put the Chinese Communist Party over God, not that he would be required to recite the pledge of loyalty to the party. The Appellant states that the RPD's narrow interpretation caused it to find that he was incorrect in his testimony.\n[21] The Appellant also indicated that the RPD's misapprehension of the evidence caused it to ignore important and contradictory evidence which supports his testimony that he would have been required to put the Chinese Communist Party over God. The Appellant stated several issues regarding restrictions made on state churches, and quoted the National Documentation Package (NDP) documentation to support this submission.7 The Appellant respectfully submits that the RPD was in error in not considering the totality of the evidence to further find against his identity as a genuine Christian.\n[22] The Appellant did not make any submissions regarding the RPD's finding in limited Christian knowledge, and his inability to explain the Pentecost for the Pentecostal Church in Canada.\n[23] The RAD finds the question raised by the Appellant is one of semantics. In testimony, he clearly stated that he could not join the state sanctioned church in China because he would have to put the Communist Party ahead of God, and that violated the first of the 10 Commandments. In referencing the RPD's documentation, the RAD finds that the Appellant's testimony that he would have to put the Communist Party ahead of God has no validity. The RPD's decision was based on the Appellant's testimony regarding his unwillingness to join the legal state sanctioned church in China. The RAD finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant's reasoning for not being involved with the legal state sanctioned church has no validity.\n[24] The RAD is aware of Federal jurisprudence that cautions against microscopic examination of a person's religious knowledge. However, in listening to the recording of the RPD hearing, the RAD finds that Appellant's knowledge about his Pentecostal Church and the nature of the Pentecost is extraordinarily limited. It would be reasonable and credible to expect that the Appellant would have an understanding of the basis of the church that he joined in Canada. The basic questions he was asked during the hearing about Christianity were at best rudimentary, and the demonstrated no insight into the basis of his alleged religion. Although not critical, it would be reasonable that if the Appellant was a genuine practitioner, and had taken the four weeks of study that he testified to, some deeper understanding of the nature of his religion, and the church he joined, would have been acquired The RAD finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant has joined the Pentecostal Church in Canada in order to promote a refugee claim.\nTreatment of House Church Christians in China\n[25] Quoting documentation, the RPD noted that documentary evidence concerning the treatment of house church Christians is mixed, and there are examples of authorities harassing congregants.8 The RPD quoting the US Department of State had designated China as a country of particular concern in regard to religious freedom.9 However, the RPD found that the preponderance of evidence indicates that Christians can practice their faith in a lawful church, and authorities generally do not concern themselves with small house church gatherings.10 The RPD found, on a balance of probabilities, that should the Appellant consider himself a faithful Christian owing to his church activities in Canada, there are many congregations he could attend in China without attracting the interest of authorities. The RPD also found, on a balance of probabilities, that the authorities have no interest in him, and that the Appellant acquired Christian knowledge in Canada for the purpose of bolstering his refugee claim.\n[26] The Appellant submitted that the concept of religious freedom is one that entails open and free practice. He respectfully submits that the RPD was unreasonable to suggest that he could return to his home country and attend a state sanctioned church. He submitted that the RPD cannot reasonably expect him to do this and demonstrate his beliefs in a manner that conforms with what the Chinese government has deemed acceptable for to demonstrate his beliefs at a \"small\" church in order to avoid persecution\n[27] The RAD reviewed the documentation referenced by the RPD, and finds that although the harassment of underground Christians does occur upon occasion, the majority of the evidence and documentation indicates that the authorities do not concern themselves with small underground churches. Given the reasoning above in this decision, the Appellant has no credible basis for not joining the state sanctioned church in China should he return to China. Also, should he choose, he could involve himself with a small house church.\n[28] The RAD finds that one of the bases of the Appellant's refugee claim has no validity. Nothing presented in evidence or testimony that would indicate that he personally was wanted by the PSB in China for the practice of underground Christianity. No documentation was presented to substantiate that was wanted by the authorities, for the practice of Christianity, after he left China. In addition, there was no documentation of evidence submitted that substantiates his allegations of a fellow practitioner being arrested. He has demonstrated limited knowledge about Christianity, and although Federal jurisprudence has warned against microscopic examination, it would be reasonable to expect that he would understand the concept of the Pentecost in that he has joined a Pentecostal Church in Canada.\nDisposition\n[29] The RAD confirms the determination of the Refugee Protection Division and dismisses the appeal according to section 111(1)(a) of the IRPA\n(signed)\n\"Robert S.

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX, a citizen of Burundi, is appealing against a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejecting her refugee protection claim.\n[2] She has presented no new evidence in support of her appeal but is requesting that a hearing be held before the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD).\nDETERMINATION OF THE APPEAL\n[3] Pursuant to subsection 111(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), the RAD confirms the determination of the RPD, namely, that XXXX XXXX XXXX is not a \"Convention Refugee\" under section 96 of the IRPA or a \"person in need of protection\" within the meaning of section 97 of the IRPA.\nBACKGROUND\n[4] The appellant is a 26-year-old woman who alleges in her Basis of Claim Form (BOC Form), filed before the RPD, that she is of Tutsi ethnicity and fears a group called the Imbonerakure, which is of Hutu ethnicity and has ties to the ruling political party in Burundi.\n[5] The appellant alleges that her parents (her father and step-mother) run a restaurant in the city of XXXX and have been threatened and extorted by the Imbonerakure since January 2014 for that reason. She alleges that because her father refused to pay the group, he received summonses from the police and was fined, under threat of being imprisoned.\n[6] The appellant alleges that the Imbonerakure had her parents' restaurant closed down in March 2014, when her father stopped paying the bribes. She alleges that her parents opened another restaurant in a different location in April 2014 and continued to receive threats, specifically that their children would be kidnapped.\n[7] The appellant left her country on XXXX XXXX, 2014, for Canada, where she claimed refugee protection on or around June 29, 2014.\n[8] The Minister of Public Safety of Canada (the Minister), through his representative, intervened before the RPD by filing a Notice of Intervention, submitting that the appellant was not credible, notably because of the delay in claiming refugee protection following her arrival in Canada.\n[9] The RPD hearing was held on October 21, 2014, and in a decision rendered on October 24, 2014, it rejected the claim for refugee protection on the ground that it was not credible that the Imbonerakure extorted her parents because they are Tutsis who own a restaurant.\n[10] The RPD based its decision on the documentary evidence on the record indicating that the Imbonerakure particularly targets their political opponents, which the appellant and her family members are not. The RPD noted that nothing in the documentary evidence indicates that the Imbonerakure extort money from Tutsi businesspeople. In addition, the RPD found it improbable that the appellant's parents would keep their second restaurant open if their lives and their safety were at risk for that reason.\n[11] Before the RAD, the appellant submits that the RPD [translation] \"...made a number of errors of fact and of law that led it to reject the claim...\" (paragraph 5 of the appellant's memorandum), which are summarized below:\n- The RPD failed to consider the documentary evidence which indicates that the Imbonerakure is a dangerous group;\n- The RPD did not explain why it gave no probative value to the letter from her father and the copies of the summonses entered into evidence;\n- The RPD failed to consider the documentary evidence which indicates that the Imbonerakure targets Tutsis;\n- The RPD failed to give the appellant the benefit of the doubt when assessing her credibility.\n[12] For these reasons, the appellant is requesting that the RAD hold a hearing, set aside the determination of the RPD and grant her refugee protection, or, in the alternative, refer the matter to the RPD for re-determination.\n[13] The Minister did not intervene before the RAD.\nDECISION ON HOLDING A HEARING BEFORE THE RAD\n[14] Under subsection 110(6) of the IRPA, the RAD may hold a hearing if, in its opinion, the new evidence presented on appeal is admissible and meets the following three criteria: 1) it raises a serious issue with respect to the person's credibility; 2) it is central to the decision with respect to the refugee protection claim; and 3) if accepted, it would justify allowing or rejecting the refugee protection claim.\n[15] Because the prerequisite of that provision was not met in the case at hand since no new evidence was adduced on appeal, I find that a hearing cannot be held in this case.\nRAD'S ROLE\n[16] The IRPA does not expressly set out the standard of review or intervention to be applied by the RAD when it reviews the decisions rendered by the RPD. In this case, the appellant does not propose what the role of the RAD should be or what standard of review it should apply when RPD decisions are appealed to it.\n[17] The Federal Court, which has the authority to review the RAD's decisions, has rendered several decisions to date about the standard of review or intervention that the RAD should apply or its role when RPD decisions are appealed to it.\n[18] In Alvarez1 and Eng,2 both rendered on July 17, 2014, the Honourable Justice Shore of the Federal Court of Canada ruled on this matter.\n[19] At paragraphs 28 and 29 of Alvarez, as well as paragraphs 29 and 30 of Eng, the Court writes as follows:\n[28] Parliament conferred a true appellate function on the RAD, a specialized (if not overspecialized) tribunal, which sits on appeal of the decisions of another administrative tribunal. Contrary to a court exercising a superintending and reforming power over public bodies, the RAD's primary responsibility is to ensure the integrity and consistency of proceedings before the RPD and to reduce needless duplication of proceedings (including before the Federal Court). When analyzing a decision of the RPD, the RAD must not merely determine whether it was made in a reasonable manner, but, rather, analyze whether the RPD relied on a wrong principle of law or misassessed the facts to the point of making a palpable and overriding error (Housen, above).\n[29] \"Palpable and overriding error\" is often used interchangeably with the \"clearly wrong\" or \"unreasonable\" decision test. However, this is the appellate-level standard of intervention that a specialized appeal tribunal such as the RAD must apply when reviewing a decision and not the judicial review standard of reasonableness. Even though there are similarities, these standards are different.\n[20] The Court adds the following at paragraph 33 of Alvarez, as well as paragraph 34 of Eng:\n[33] The Court agrees that the RPD, as the tribunal of first instance, is owed a measure of deference with regard to its findings of fact, and of fact and law. The RPD is better situated to draw such conclusions as it is the tribunal of first instance, the trier of facts, having the advantage of hearing testimony viva voce (Housen, above). However, the RAD must nonetheless perform its own assessment of all of the evidence in order to determine whether the RPD relied on a wrong principle of law or misassessed the facts to the point of making a palpable and overriding error. The idea that the RAD may substitute an original decision by a determination that should have been rendered without first assessing the evidence is completely inconsistent with the purpose of the IRPA and the case law dealing with the virtually identical wording of subsection 67(2). The Court finds that the RAD misinterpreted its role as an appeal body in holding that its role was merely to assess, against a standard of reasonableness, whether the RPD's decision is within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes.\n[21] In Huruglica,3 rendered on August 22, 2014, the Honourable Justice Phelan of the Federal Court examines the role and functions of the RAD and writes as follows:\n[44] Subject to specific language, the need for deference, for example, is less compelling between the RAD and the RPD than it is between the judiciary and the executive. The relationship is more akin to that between a trial court and an appellate court but further influenced by the much greater remedial powers given to the appellate tribunal.\n[45] Therefore, a standard of review analysis is not an appropriate analytical approach....\n[22] In considering the RAD's authority under subsection 111(1) of the IRPA to substitute the determination that \"in its opinion, should have been made,\" Justice Phelan writes:\n[47] Unlike judicial review, the RAD, pursuant to subsection 111(1)(b), may substitute the determination which \"in its opinion, should have been made\". One precondition of exercising this power is that the RAD must conduct an independent assessment of the application in order to arrive at its own opinion. It is not necessary, in order to trigger this remedial power, that the RAD must find error on some standard of review basis.\n[48] The restriction on the ability to receive fresh evidence is not a bar to conducting a de novo appeal....\n[23] Justice Phelan concludes as follows:\n[54] Having concluded that the RAD erred in reviewing the RPD's decision on the standard of reasonableness, I have further concluded that for the reasons above, the RAD is required to conduct a hybrid appeal. It must review all aspects of the RPD's decision and come to an independent assessment of whether the claimant is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. Where its assessment departs from that of the RPD, the RAD must substitute its own decision.\n[55] In conducting its assessment, it can recognize and respect the conclusion of the RPD on such issues as credibility and\/or where the RPD enjoys a particular advantage in reaching such a conclusion but it is not restricted, as an appellate court is, to intervening on facts only where there is a \"palpable and overriding error\".\n[24] In Spasoja,4 rendered on September 23, 2014, the Honourable Justice Roy of the Federal Court also examines the RAD's role.\n[25] In that decision, in line with the previous decisions in Huruglica, Eng and Alvarez, the Court first finds that the RAD erred in applying the reasonableness standard rather than conducting an independent assessment of the claim for refugee protection (paragraph 12).\n[26] The Honourable Justice Roy proceeds with a detailed analysis of the statutory provisions concerning the RAD under the IRPA; of the case law pertaining to the role of an appellate body within an administrative tribunal, specifically Parizeau;5 and of Parliament's intent regarding the RAD as stated by various stakeholders in debates before the parliamentary committee of the House of Commons to determine that the appeal referred to in sections 110 and 111 of the IRPA cannot be equated to a judicial review, but to an appeal in its own right (paragraph 39).\n[27] Relying on the conclusions in Parizeau with respect to the standard of review to be applied by an appeal tribunal, and distinguishing himself from his colleague who rendered the Court's decision in Huruglica, the Honourable Justice Roy concludes that the standards of review to be applied by the RAD are correctness for questions of law, and palpable and overriding error for questions of fact and questions of mixed fact and law. In addition, the RAD must show deference to the RPD's findings on the credibility given to the witnesses heard before it (paragraphs 39, 40 and 46).\n[28] The Honourable Justice Roy also indicates that he could not find any indicators providing for an appeal de novo (paragraph 42) and states in the following paragraph of his decision that:\n[43] Instead, the scheme under review addresses appeals on specific questions, be it of fact, of law or of mixed law and fact (subsection 110(1)). In my view, that means that the appellant must identify the questions on which the appeal will focus. It will be on the basis of the record of proceedings before the RPD that the appeal will be heard based on the questions identified and raised, subject to the documentary evidence (subsection 110(3)) or evidence that is consistent with subsection 110(4)....\n[29] Lastly, in a decision rendered on October 8, 2014 (Alyafi v. M.C.I., 2014 FC 952), the Honourable Justice Martineau of the Federal Court, having analyzed the above decisions, first concludes that they all reject the reasonableness standard of review and subsequently states that, in his opinion, the RAD must be allowed to choose between the two remaining approaches: the one outlined in Eng, Alvarez and Spasoja, which is the standard of palpable and overriding error, and the one outlined in Huruglica, which he describes as \"a composite and variable standard of review resulting from the nature of the claim before the RAD-characterized as a hybrid appeal-and the particular nature of questions of fact, or of mixed fact and law, raised by an appellant\" (paragraph 16).\n[30] In paragraph 46 of Alyafi, Justice Martineau writes the following:\n[46] ... I chose the middle path, that of wisdom: allow the RAD to apply the second or third approach as long as the question of the scope of the appellate review of the RPD's decisions has not been settled by a final judgment by the Federal Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court of Canada. Quite simply.\n[31] Consequently, I am of the opinion that it is preferable for the RAD to apply the principles established in Spasoja because, with respect, the role of the RAD described therein appears to me to be more easily applied than the role described in Huruglica, particularly when, as in the case at hand, no new evidence is submitted before the RAD and no hearing is held before it.\n[32] In this case, I am of the opinion that the error alleged by the appellant with respect to the assessment of her credibility is a question of fact, and I will therefore apply the standard of palpable and overriding error and will defer to the RPD's findings on this matter.\n[33] I will conduct a review and my own assessment of all the evidence before the RPD in order to determine whether it committed a palpable and overriding error.\n[34] At paragraph 91 of Parizeau, a palpable and overriding error is described as follows:\n[translation]\n[91] ... A palpable and overriding error is an error that, in its undeniability-and therefore not a difference of opinion on the assessment of the evidence-determines the outcome of the dispute in that the conclusion of the trier of fact, i.e. the result of his or her decision, cannot hold, thus, ipso facto, making the decision unreasonable.\nANALYSIS\n[35] The issue in this case is whether the RPD erred in its assessment of the appellant's credibility.\n[36] In my opinion, after analyzing all the evidence submitted, listening to the recording of the hearing before the RPD, and considering the RPD's reasons and the appellant's memorandum, the answer to this question is no, for the following reasons.\n[37] As mentioned above, the RPD found that the appellant's allegations that she and her family were persecuted by the Imbonerakure by reason of their Tutsi ethnicity were not credible. I agree with the RPD's finding.\n[38] In its reasons, the RPD cites excerpts from the documentary evidence filed on the record which indicates that the Imbonerakure, which is affiliated with the ruling party in Burundi, particularly targets political opponents (National Documentation Package on Burundi, March 31, 2014, Tab 7.5).\n[39] I also find that the documentary evidence does not establish that Tutsis are persecuted in Burundi by reason of their ethnicity, as the appellant alleges. In paragraph 13 of her memorandum, the appellant submits that the RPD failed to consider the evidence indicating that the Imbonerakure also targets Tutsis. However, the appellant does not city any of this supposed evidence. On the contrary, in paragraph 14 and following of her memorandum, the appellant cites evidence about the violence in Burundi for political reasons.\n[40] I find, as did the RPD, that there is cause to give more probative value to the documentary evidence, which comes from objective and generally well-known sources, than to the appellant's allegations. In my opinion, if the situation for Tutsis in Burundi were as the appellant describes, it would be mentioned in the documentary evidence, which is not the case.\n[41] On the contrary, another document in the National Documentation Package states the following regarding interethnic relations in Burundi:6\nTutsis make up between 14 (International Crisis Group 25 Oct. 2012, 11) and 15 per cent of the population of Burundi (US 8 Apr. 2011, 27). In comparison, the Hutu majority constitutes approximately 85 per cent of the population (ibid., 38; Independent Consultant 28 Jan. 2013).\nIn a telephone interview with the Research Directorate, a professor of philosophy at the university of Sudbury, who is originally from Burundi and has written about the political situation in the African Great Lakes Region and in Burundi, stated that, in his opinion, relations between the ethnic groups in Burundi were [translation] \"surprisingly good, given the events of the past\" (Professor of Philosophy 28 Jan. 2013). According to him, there [translation] \"is not really\" any ethnic tension (ibid.). Likewise, an independent consultant posted in Burundi who has worked for 25 years with an NGO that promotes democracy and human rights in Central Africa and in Burundi, namely the Belgian Red Cross, stated in a telephone interview with the Research Directorate that the [translation] \"divisions\" were not as significant as in the past and that relations had \"normalized\" (28 Jan. 2013). In a telephone interview with the Research Directorate, a research fellow and historian with the Centre for African Studies at the School of Higher Education in Social Sciences (Centre d'\u00e9tudes africaines de l'\u00c9cole des hautes \u00e9tudes en sciences sociales) in France, whose research focuses on the African Great Lakes Region and whose doctoral thesis deals with modern politics in Burundi, stated that ethnic issues were being discussed [translation] \"more openly\" in Burundi (Research Fellow 5 Feb. 2013).\nCorroborating sources indicated that conflicts in the country were mainly in opposition to the Hutus (Professor Emeritus 29 Jan. 2013; Independent Consultant 28 Jan. 2013; Professor of Philosophy 28 Jan. 2013). The independent consultant did however explain that Burundi was still in a [translation] \"post-conflict situation,\" adding that some divisions will probably never be \"completely\" erased and that there is still \"a risk that tensions and conflicts\" could be reignited (Independent Consultant 28 Jan. 2013). He also stated that it was impossible to tell whether there are any [translation] \"isolated incidents of intimidation or killings,\" because come people have not forgotten the past and may still have \"accounts to settle\" (ibid.). Moreover, a fact sheet on relations between Canada and Burundi that is available on the website of the Government of Canada indicated that [Government of Canada English version] \"[p]eacebuilding and national reconciliation remain fragile in Burundi,\" and that there are \"reports of repeated violations of human rights\" (Canada May 2012). According to the Research Fellow, ethnic issues may also be [translation] \"used as a political instrument\" (5 Feb. 2013).\nIn a telephone interview with the Research Directorate, a professor emeritus in political science at the University of Florida who has studied ethnic conflicts in Central Africa, including Burundi, stated that, by benefitting from certain advantages in the past, and from superior education, [translation] \"many\" Tutsis work in field of business within the government administration, in NGOs or for international organizations, and are in a \"more comfortable situation\" than the Hutus (Professor Emeritus 29 Jan. 2013). According to the Professor, some might think that the Tutsis are [translation] \"favoured\" and that they continue to have some degree of domination and therefore feel \"some resentment\" toward them (ibid.). Moreover, the Research Fellow stated that there are still cases of [translation] \"social stigma\" based on ethnicity (Research Fellow 5 Feb. 2013). As an example, she referred to a website, www.nyabusorongo.org, which provides an ethnic breakdown of government and NGO employees, and which publishes lists with the names of Tutsis working in the government and NGOs, as well as their position (ibid.). According to the Research Fellow, that site does not incite violence or murder, but it sends an [translation] \"unhealthy\" message, implying that there is still a \"Tutsi supremacy\" (ibid.).\nTwo sources consulted by the Research Directorate indicated that there is little or no discrimination against Tutsis (Independent Consultant 28 Jan. 2013; Professor of Philosophy 28 Jan. 2013). The Professor Emeritus stated that he was not aware of any cases of discrimination against Tutsis, but that there could however be individual or local incidents (29 Jan. 2013).\n[42] As the appellant mentions in her memorandum, the documentary evidence indicates that the Imbonerakure targets certain people and, consequently, is what she calls [translation] \"a dangerous group.\" However, as mentioned above, the documentary evidence indicates that the Imbonerakure particularly targets political opponents, not Tutsis by reason of their ethnicity. Consequently, I find that the RPD did not err by failing to consider this documentary evidence in its analysis, as the appellant submits.\n[43] I also find, as the RPD found, that there is no cause, because of the credibility issues raised, to give probative value to the letter from the appellant's father (pages 272 and 273 of the RPD record) and the copies of the summonses that the appellant's father allegedly received (page 267 of the RPD record). The letter from the appellant's father is a handwritten letter that does not come from a neutral and well-known source that could contradict the above-mentioned documentary evidence. As for the summonses, they do not indicate why the appellant's father was allegedly summoned to the police station. In my opinion, the RPD did not err in giving no probative value to these documents.\n[44] Finally, I find that the RPD did not err in not giving the appellant the benefit of the doubt, as she alleges in her memorandum. I find that the RPD explains why it did not believe the appellant, notably by giving more probative value to the documentary evidence on the situation in Burundi than to the appellant's testimony.\n[45] In light of the above, I conclude that the appellant did not demonstrate that the RPD made an error when assessing her credibility that would justify the RAD's intervention.\nREMEDY\n[46] For these reasons, I confirm the determination of the RPD, namely, that XXXX XXXX XXXX is not a \"Convention refugee\" under section 96 of the IRPA or a \"person in need of protection\" within the meaning of section 97 of the IRPA.\n[47] The appeal is dismissed.\nNormand Leduc\nNormand Leduc\nMay 22, 2015\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SAR : MB4-04702\n12\nRAD.25.02 (2014.09.11)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] The Appellant, XXXX XXXX, a citizen of India, allegedly fears members of his family and his wife's family because he does not want to remain in his arranged marriage. The Refugee Protection Division (RPD), denied his claim in a decision dated January 30, 2020, after finding that he has internal flight alternatives (IFA).\n[2] The Appellant appeals to the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD), and request that the RPD's decision be set aside and substituted with a determination that he is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. In the alternative, the Appellant requests that the matter be referred back to a different panel of the RPD for redetermination.1\nDETERMINATION\n[3] The appeal is dismissed. I confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.2\nSUMMARY OF THE FACTS\n[4] The Appellant is a 32-year-old man from Hyderabad, the capital and largest city of the Indian state of Telangana. In XXXX 2017 he entered into a marriage which was arranged by his parents and his wife's parents. He states that he does not love or trust his wife and \"the tolerance that I had for her presence now has turned into an absolute aversion.\"\n[5] The Appellant left India XXXX XXXX, 2017, and entered Canada with a work permit. His wife arrived a year later on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018, on a visitor's visa. He informed her of his feelings at that time, and they left for India together on XXXX XXXX, 2018, where he intended to drop her off and return to Canada. On XXXX XXXX, 2018, a meeting was held with both sides of the family, during which his father and his wife's parents threatened that \"[w]e will bury you,\" after they learned that he no longer wanted to remain in the marriage. That night his wife proposed \"a trial run,\" during which they would spend \"a couple of months in Canada,\" and she wrote her ideas down into an agreement. When the Appellant woke up the next morning at 9:00 a.m., however, he found approximately 8 - 10 people in the living room, including their parents, his younger brother, uncles from both sides of the family, and his family's lawyer. The family lawyer was allegedly using terms like \"jail, deportation, passport revoke, mental agony, financial strain, red corner notice, extradition, etc.,\" which the Appellant interpreted as \"threats veiled just enough that they don't seem like a threat [...].\" On that basis the Appellant believes that \"my parents and her parents will do anything to destroy my life and even trumped up charges to force me into the relationship that I cannot have and continue as I don't love her.\"\n[6] The Appellant left Hyderabad for Delhi that day and boarded a flight to Canada on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018. He filed his claim for refugee protection on November 22, 2018.\nTHE RPD DECISION\n[7] The RPD determined that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection because he has viable IFAs in New Delhi and Mumbai. While unnecessary when IFA is the determinative issue, the RPD assessed whether his allegations form a nexus to one of the grounds of persecution under the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (the \"Refugee Convention\"), and limited its analysis to the question of whether he is a person in need of protection after finding that a nexus has not been established.3\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[8] The Appellant submits an online court record of alleged \"trump up charges against him in India,\" five articles about section 498A of the Indian Penal Code, and a copy of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, as proposed new evidence in this appeal.\n[9] New evidence is only admissible before the RAD if it arose after the rejection of the claim, if it was not reasonably available, or if the Appellant could not have reasonably been expected in the circumstances to have presented the evidence at the time of the rejection of the claim.4 In addition to these legislative requirements, under the Federal Court of Appeal decisions in Singh and Raza, admissibility is limited to evidence that is relevant, new, and credible.5\n[10] The online court record does not meet one of the three legislative criteria and is therefore inadmissible. The record contains limited information that a proceeding involving section 498A of the Indian Penal Code and section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act was filed and registered on XXXX XXXX, 2019, that the first hearing date was held on November 26, 2019, and the second hearing date was scheduled for March 24, 2020. The convenient timing of this information is highly suspect, as it indicates that a hearing on these charges was scheduled on XXXX XXXX, 2019 - XXXX XXXX XXXX the Appellant's hearing before the RPD on November 25, 2019. Ultimately, however, this information did not arise after the rejection of the claim. The evidence was also available to the Appellant and he reasonably could have been expected to have submitted it prior to the rejection of his claim. Indeed, according to his memorandum he had this evidence and sought to submit it prior to the rejection of his claim but felt \"forced to wait until I received confirmation of Reasons and Decision from the RPD,\" because \"the guidelines and procedures in the literature\" does not \"indicate any way of submitting additional evidence when appellant is waiting for decision.\" There is no merit to this argument since Rule 43 of the Refugee Protection Divisions Rules outlines the process of submitting a document after a hearing but before the RPD's decision takes effect.\n[11] Nor do the five news articles or the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, meet one of the three legislative criteria for admissibility. Four of the articles are dated February 7, 2016, January 14, 2019, February 25, 2011, and September 15, 2018, and the Dowry Prohibition Act was enacted in 1961 - long prior to the date the Appellant's claim was rejected on January 30, 2020. The fifth article is from the website of a New York lawyer and is undated. Based on the content of the article I am not satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that it arose after the rejection of the claim. The article addresses section 498A which was added to the Indian Penal Code in 1983, and the author states, \"[a]s recently as January 31, 2009, Justice K.G. Balakrishnan, the Chief Justice of India, addressing India's National Commission for Women, asserted that Section 498A is being 'grossly misused' [...].\" All of these documents are publicly available online and the Appellant has not argued that they were not reasonably available to him. Lastly, the Appellant could have reasonably been expected in the circumstances to have presented this evidence prior to the rejection of his claim since it pertains to his alleged fear of \"trumped-up charges.\" This evidence is therefore inadmissible.\n[12] The Appellant's request for a hearing before the RAD is denied because the proposed new evidence is inadmissible. Hearings before the RAD are limited to circumstances when the new evidence on appeal is admissible and raises a serious issue with respect to the Appellant's credibility that is central to the decision, and if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the refugee protection claim.6\nISSUES\n[13] The determinative issue in this appeal is the viability of IFAs in New Delhi and Mumbai.\nROLE OF THE RAD\n[14] The standard of correctness applies to this appeal as set out by the Federal Court of Appeal in Huruglica.7 This requires an independent assessment of the refugee claim to determine whether the RPD was correct in its findings and determinations.8 While deference can be afforded to the RPD on specific issues when it enjoys a meaningful advantage over the RAD in making findings of fact or mixed fact and law, such an advantage does not arise in the present case.\nANALYSIS\n[15] After considering the Appellant's arguments and conducting an independent assessment of the entire record, which includes the transcript of the proceeding before the RPD, I agree with the RPD's determination that the Appellant has viable IFAs in New Delhi and Mumbai.\n[16] Refugee claimants are expected to seek protection in another part of their own country, if it is available, before they seek refuge in Canada.9 The notion of an IFA is inherent in the definition of a Convention refugee because refugee protection is a form of surrogate protection.10 Accordingly, the Appellant bears the onus of demonstrating that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout the country, including the area identified as an IFA.11\n[17] The analysis for assessing an IFA has two parts according to the Federal Court in Rasaratnam.12 I must first determine whether there is a serious possibility that the Appellant will be persecuted, or whether he will face, on a balance of probabilities, a danger of torture, a risk to his life, or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the proposed IFAs. Secondly, I must also be satisfied, after considering the Appellant's individual circumstances and the conditions in the proposed IFAs, that it would not be unreasonable to seek refuge in these locations. An IFA will only be viable if both criteria are met.13\nThere is no serious possibility of persecution or risk of harm in New Delhi and Mumbai\n[18] The Appellant has viable IFA options in New Delhi and Mumbai where he does not face a serious possibility of persecution or a risk of harm. The evidence does not establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the agents of harm have the means to search for him throughout India, a country with over 1.3 billion inhabitants, and locate him in either of the two proposed IFA locations. An IFA analysis requires a contextual approach, looking at the profile of the agents of harm, their motivation to search for the Appellant, and their ability to locate him. There can only be a serious possibility of persecution if the agents of harm have both the \"means and the motivation\" to pursue and locate him.14\n[19] I do not accept the Appellant's submission that the agents of harm have the \"ability to track me in any major cities [sic] across the country.\" Contrary to this assertion, when he was directly asked by the RPD \"how would these people locate you?\", he acknowledged that \"I cannot say for sure,\" and could only speculate that \"if they are looking for me over there, or if they even have an idea, it might not be tomorrow, it might not be a year from now, but eventually something will lead back.\"\n[20] The RPD also correctly concluded that the profile of the agents of harm does not demonstrate that they have the means to search for him throughout India and locate him in either New Delhi or Mumbai. The Appellant testified that the agents of harm comprise his father, two of his uncles, a lawyer routinely retained by his family, his wife's parents, and four of his wife's uncles who are lawyers. All of the agents of harm live and work in Hyderabad.\n[21] The Appellant's in-laws live in Hyderabad approximately three kilometres from his parents' home. According to his testimony, his father-in-law works for a private telecommunications company and oversees the northern Hyderabad station. The sole evidence he provided about his mother-in-law is that she \"is impulsive and has - is known for a bit of a mental imbalance. But I'm not sure if she was ever diagnosed or to [sic].\" When specifically asked whether \"they travel to New Delhi or Mumbai?\", he answered \"[n]ot that I'm aware of.\" The RPD also considered his testimony that his wife has extended family members in Mumbai, but correctly held that he did not adduce evidence to establish who they are and whether they pose a threat to him.\n[22] The lawyers also live and work in Hyderabad \"in the same area\" according to the Appellant. He could not offer further details about his wife's uncles aside from his belief that they are lawyers because he had never met them prior to the alleged incident on XXXX XXXX, 2018. He expressed concern that the lawyers would \"destroy [...] my life and bury [...] me under legal cases,\" although he could not provide evidence about their ability to locate him. When specifically asked whether these lawyers \"have means to pursue you?\", he could only offer that \"I'm not sure because I have never met them for more than an hour at a time, other than the actual day of event.\"\n[23] When the Appellant was asked why he fears his uncles he offered that \"[m]y younger uncle, he is a violent person, extremely violent person. And as far as my older uncle, he has a tendency to throw his weight around, use his influence and power to get things done.\" Both men live Hyderabad. One is a XXXX XXXX XXXX from the XXXX XXXX who XXXX XXXX XXXX around Hyderabad. The other is a local businessman. The Appellant's belief that these men can bribe government officials is speculative and does not on its own establish that they have the means to search for him and locate him in New Delhi or Mumbai.\n[24] The Appellant emphasized that his father is the main person he fears and described him as a \"class A manipulator,\" the \"linchpin\" and the \"seed of power\" in the family, although the evidence does not establish that his father has the means to search for him and locate him in New Delhi or Mumbai. His father retired from the XXXX XXXX in approximately 2002 or 2002 and has been working as for the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX where he XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. When asked whether his father travels for work, the Appellant testified that \"[h]e travels but to the nearby locations only, because of his seniority and his position he reports directly to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. So he only travels in and around Hyderabad,\" and would not likely have to travel often to New Delhi or Mumbai given his work in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The evidence about his father's current position and role in the XXXX XXXX 20 years ago does not establish that he has the means to locate the Appellant.\n[25] The RPD correctly found that the allegations that the Appellant's father filed a missing person report with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), and contacted the Indian Consulate in Vancouver do not establish that he has the means to search for him throughout India and locate him in New Delhi or Mumbai. His family knew that he was working in Canada and had previously attended college in British Columbia from 2016 to 2018. The e-mail correspondence which the Appellant alleges is from the Indian consulate in Vancouver is suspect because the listed e-mail address of the consular official is @XXXX XXXX XXXX rather than an official Government of India account. Ultimately, however, even if I accept that the e-mails are authentic, they do not demonstrate that his father has the means to locate him. As the RPD pointed out, the consular official was only able to contact him because he provided his e-mail address in his passport application. The consular official also expressly states in his e-mails that he is unaware of the Appellant's address and telephone number. Relatedly, I agree with the RPD that the e-mails from the consulate official do not establish the Appellant's belief that his father successfully had \"lookout circular issued,\" or that \"if I were to step in India, the Immigration will basically arrest me and that would lead to my location being exposed directly to my family.\"\n[26] The Appellant argues that the agents of harm may be able to find him through national identity documents like his Aadhar card and passport, when he rents accommodation, or when background checks are conducted, although he has not pointed to evidence in support of this submission. Without evidence demonstrating that the agents of harm have access to the Appellant's personal information his assertion alone does not establish that they have the means to locate him through these methods.\n[27] Lastly, the objective evidence in the National Documentation Package (NDP), on the prevalence of honour-based crimes in India does not establish that the agents of harm have the means to locate the Appellant. The term \"honour crimes\" is largely used to describe \"incidents of violence and harassment caused to [a] young couple intending to marry to having married against the wishes of the community or family members,\" which differs from the Appellant's circumstances.15 Victims of honour-based violence \"are mostly women,\" although \"[s]ources also report incidents where victims were male [...] or cases where victims were both men and women.\"16 None of this evidence establishes, on a balance of probabilities, that the agents of harm have the means to search for the Appellant throughout India and locate him in either New Delhi or Mumbai.\n[28] For all of the reasons outlined above, based upon my own independent review of the evidence, I am satisfied that the first part of the Rasaratnam test has been met. The Appellant has not shown that he faces either a serious possibility of persecution, or, on a balance of probabilities, a danger of torture, a risk to his life, cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in New Delhi and Mumbai.\nIt is reasonable for the Appellant to relocate to New Delhi or Mumbai\n[29] I am satisfied that it is reasonable for the Appellant to relocate to either New Delhi or Mumbai based on his specific circumstances and the objective evidence in the NDP.\n[30] I do not accept the Appellant's submission that the fact that he has lived in multiple locations in India as a child but not as an adult establishes that it is unreasonable for him to relocate to either New Delhi or Mumbai. The RPD considered relevant factors which inform the analysis of whether New Delhi and Mumbai are reasonable IFAs in the Appellant's current circumstances, including his education, work experience, language skills, and ability to secure employment and accommodation. I have not identified any errors in the RPD's analysis based on my independent assessment, and find that its determination is correct.\n[31] There is no merit to the argument that the missing person report would render him \"figuratively speaking 'Radiosactive,'\" and prevent him from finding employment because \"no company would hire you if you are deemed as liability [sic].\" I see no correlation between a missing person report to the RCMP and the Appellant's ability to secure employment in India.\n[32] I acknowledge the Appellant's point that he \"uprooted himself once to come to Canada in 2016 and started a professional career in 2018,\" but do not find that the financial strain which he refers to makes relocation to either New Delhi or Mumbai unreasonable. The Federal Court of Appeal has established, \"a very high threshold for the unreasonableness test. It requires nothing less than the existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant in travelling or temporarily relocating to a safe area.\"17\n[33] For all of the reasons outlined above, after considering all of the Appellant's personal circumstances and the objective evidence in the NDP, I am satisfied that the second part of the Rasaratnam test has been met and that it would not be objectively unreasonable in the circumstances for him to relocate to either New Delhi or Mumbai.\nCONCLUSION\n[34] The RPD was correct in its determination that the Appellant has viable IFAs in New Delhi and Mumbai. I therefore dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.18\nJohn Helis\nJohn Helis\nMarch 19, 2021\nDate\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD File \/ Dossier de la SAR : VC0-01430\nRAD.25.02 (January, 2020)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n2\nImmigration and Refugee\nBoard of Canada\nRefugee Appeal Division\nCommission de l'immigration\net du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 du Canada\nSection d'appel des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s\nRAD.25.02 (January, 2020)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] This is an appeal of a decision by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) of Canada rejecting the claims of XXXX XXXX XXXX (hereinafter XXXX), his wife, XXXX XXXX XXXX, their minor son, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and their minor daughter, XXXX XXXX XXXX (hereinafter collectively referred to as the Appellants) for reasons relating to credibility, or XXXX lack thereof, and for the existence of an Internal Flight Alternative (IFA). XXXX and his wife also had another child born to them in Toronto, Canada in XXXX 2018. This child is not a party to the present appeal.\n[2] The Appellants filed their claim based on alleged fears that they will be subjected to traditional rituals or even killed if they return to Nigeria because of XXXX refusal to accept his nomination as King of the XXXX XXXX XXXX situated in the town of Orugbo Iddo within the EPE region of Lagos, Nigeria. XXXX contends that his cousin, the alleged Agent of Persecution (hereinafter the \"Cousin\"), was the other nominee for consideration as King and that his Cousin threatened XXXX, beat his wife and attempted to assassinate him; the whole, in an effort to convince XXXX to refuse the nomination as King. Notwithstanding the Cousin's alleged actions, XXXX asserts that he did, in fact, refuse the appointment as King but that the Chieftans of the XXXX family and the Kingmakers of the EPE Local Government proceeded to select him nonetheless. As a result, XXXX claims that, if he and his family return to Nigeria, they can be subjected to a punishment of rituals or even death because of XXXX refusal to ascend to his appointed title as King.\n[3] The RPD found that the Appellants did establish their identity and that the alleged fear of harm has a nexus to the Convention ground of religion. However, the RPD decided that XXXX provided insufficient credible evidence of the threats or that he continues to be pursued by the Cousin and that the objective documentary evidence for Nigeria refutes the Appellants assertions that they would suffer serious negative or possibly even life-threatening punishments if they were to return to Nigeria. As such, the RPD found that the Appellants' claim lacked credibility. And while the RAD notes, as did the RPD, that lack of credibility can, by itself, be fatal to a refugee claim, the RPD continued its analysis and, in the alternative, further concluded that the Appellants had a viable IFA in Port Harcourt and Abuja.\nDETERMINATIVE ISSUE AND DECISION\n[4] The RAD finds the RPD's credibility assessment was correct and that the Appellants lack of credibility or of their inability to provide sufficiently credible evidence was so palpable as to be, in and of itself, fatal to the Appellants' claim. The RAD, therefore, will focus its analysis on the Appellants credibility, or lack thereof, without the need to conduct any analysis or render any decision concerning the viability or reasonableness about any proposed IFA. As such, the RAD finds that the determinative issue of this matter is credibility and that, for the reasons which follow, the Appeal is dismissed.\nROLE OF THE RAD\n[5] Unless otherwise specifically stated below, the RAD has applied a correctness standard in its review of the RPD decision that is the subject of the present Appeal.\nANALYSIS\n[6] The RAD conducted an independent examination and review of the Appellants' record, listened to the recording of the RPD hearing and considered and analyzed all of the evidence and arguments placed before it. The RAD also reconsidered and re-examined the IRB Chairperson's Guideline #4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution (hereinafter the \"Guideline 4\"), and the IRB Nigerian Jurisprudential Guide1 (hereinafter referred to as the \"Nigerian JG\").\nXXXX CREDIBILITY\n[7] The RPD correctly commenced its credibility assessment by reiterating and citing the presumptive principal established in Maldonado that when a claimant swears to the truth of the allegations, the allegations are presumed true \" ... unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness\". The RPD followed this citation with its analysis and examples of such reasons before correctly concluding that the Appellants provided insufficient credible evidence to establish that they have been threatened, pursued or continue to be pursued by the Cousin or anyone else.\n[8] The RPD provided the following reasons to explain its doubts about the truthfulness of XXXX allegations: (i) XXXX inconsistent testimony; (ii) XXXX inability to identify, describe, or provide any sufficiently credible evidence about any threats from or pursuits by the Cousin subsequent to XXXX purportedly public declaration of refusal to the Kingmakers; (iii) XXXX contradictory testimony relating to the timing of the Kingmakers' proclamation of his selection versus his actual refusal; (iv) the unlikeliness that XXXX would have returned to his village if he actually believed that there was still a serious possibility that he or members of his family would be harmed by the Cousin or anyone else from the village; (v) insufficient credible evidence that he moved to a different State in December 2016 to avoid the agent(s) of persecution; and (vi) the objective documentary evidence from the Nigerian National Documentation Package (NDP) provides that refusing a chieftaincy title has no serious consequences.\n[9] The Appellants for their part argue that the RPD did not raise any serious concerns about credibility other than to question the sufficiency of credible evidence about the Cousin's alleged threats and the interpretation of the objective documentary evidence from the Nigerian NDP.\n[10] The RAD takes note of the Appellants' arguments but, respectfully, refutes them. The matter of establishing a credible fear of persecution (i.e. credibly establishing a fear of past and future persecutory actions) is at the crux of any refugee claim. For one to argue, as the Appellants have, that the RPD \" ... did not raise any serious credibility issues concerning the Appellants' credibility\" and to follow such an assertion with a statement that \" ... the only issue (before the RPD) was whether there was sufficient and credible evidence to establish that the applicant was threatened by his cousin or his clan\", is, with respect, illogical. The RPD raised credibility concerns and drew negative inferences from XXXX contradictory descriptions of the Cousin's alleged threats, their timing and about XXXX inconsistent explanations about going into hiding but then returning to his home village for public meetings. The RAD therefore submits that if there is a question concerning the sufficiency of credible evidence about the threats, then there is a question about the credibility of the claim. As such, and for the reasons below, the RAD finds, like the RPD, that there is insufficient credible evidence from the Appellants about the threats or continued pursuits from the Cousin or from anyone else in the Appellants' community.\nXXXX Inconsistent Testimony (oral and written)\n[11] XXXX testimony was inconsistent in relation to: (i) the alleged threats; (ii) the dates he allegedly notified the XXXX Council about his refusal versus the dates of the \"final\" decision; and (iii) the Appellants movements and travels between September and December 2016.\nAlleged Violent Threats\n[12] XXXX wrote in his narrative that \"an\" assassin was sent to his house in September 2016 and that he escaped through a window \"while my wife was beaten\". He then wrote that \" ... on October 13, 2016, the thugs came again but met my wife and children and left a warning message and destroyed things in the house\". During the RPD hearing, XXXX was questioned about the September incident and how he knew the man was an assassin?\" XXXX initial response was that \"he met him at his home\". He subsequently changed this testimony to state that \"his wife answered the door when \"they\" knocked and that there were two men\". XXXX then testified that the \"thugs\" returned a second time just a week after the first September incident, that the thugs broke into his house and destroyed the inside of the house. He testified that his wife and children were not at home but that he found out about this second incident (while in hiding) from his neighbours. He then testified that the \"thugs\" returned a third time, October 13, and that this time they beat his wife and left a warning message. XXXX testimony contradicts his narrative and is clearly inconsistent. XXXX narrative omits any mention of the second incident to which he testified. In his narrative, he wrote that his wife was beaten and the warning message was left during the September 2016 (i.e. the first incident), but he then testified that she was beaten and the warning message was left during the third incident on October 13. XXXX provided no satisfactory explanation for these inconsistencies and omissions, except to state that he was informed of the second incident by neighbours and remained silent concerning his recollection of the alleged beating of his wife. The RAD is not satisfied with his explanations and queries the logic of neighbours bein in a position to inform him of the second incident while he was allegedly in hiding from the Cousin and the community?\n[13] Further yet, XXXX testified that he did not move his wife and his children until after the third incident. If so, it is logical that it would have been his wife that would have discovered the second incident (given that XXXX was in hiding). XXXX testimony about this incongruity was unsatisfactory. The RAD draws negative inferences from these incongruities, omissions and contradictions and finds XXXX explanations to be lacking in logic. If XXXX escaped after the first incident \"while his wife was beaten\", why would his wife and children have only waited until after the third incident to flee into hiding? According to his testimony, his wife first went into hiding at the home of one of her friends before the family fled to Ogun State together. The Appellants' Bases of Claims (BoCs) and other claim documents, combined with the chronology of events as presented by the appellants, do not support this explanation. The RAD finds such inconsistencies, incongruities and contradictions unsatisfactory and concludes that they only serve to undermine the Appellants' overall credibility.\n[14] Likewise, XXXX did not and could not provide or testify to any other threats, be they perceived, informed or uttered, at any time following the alleged decision date of his selection as King, more specifically November 30, 2016. His testimony was, at best, inconsistent about his continued communication with his family in Nigeria. When questioned about his communications with family members back in Nigeria, he first testified that he did not want them knowing where he is\/was, then he subsequently changed his testimony to state that he speaks with each of his siblings separately. He was unable to offer any evidence that the Cousin is still seeking his whereabouts other than to state that XXXX mother informs him that he is. The RAD finds XXXX testimony about his continued communication with his family to be inconsistent and contradictory and to undermine his credibility.\nXXXX Selection as King: Final Decision Date vs. Refusal Date\n[15] The RAD notes the following chronology (hereinafter the \"Chronology\") of events as alleged in this Appeal:\n* May 19, 2016-XXXX acquires a 90-day Tanzanian VISA (VISA expires August 19, 2016);\n* July 23, 2016-former King dies and, according to rank, the XXXX Family is the next succeeding ruling house to provide nominees for selection of King;\n* Prior to September 2016 (exact date unknown)-XXXX testifies that two (2) names, XXXX and the Cousin's, are presented as nominees by the Kingmakers from XXXX XXXX XXXXat an XXXX Council meeting;\n* September 2016 (exact date unknown)-XXXX goes into hiding without his family because of a purported attempt on his life from the Cousin or the Cousin's thug(s);\n* October 2016 (exact date unknown but allegedly after October 13, 2016)-depending on XXXX testimony, the Appellants (as a family) flee to a friend's house then to Ogun State to hide from the Cousin and his thug(s);\n* XXXX 26 to XXXX XXXX, 2016-Appellants (as a family) travel to Benin, Togo and Ghana States (i.e. not Ogun State as provided in the narrative and according to XXXX testimony) before returning to Lagos, the whole according to wet stamps appearing in each of the Appellants' passports;\n* November 30, 2016-Kingmakers of the XXXX Ruling House allegedly render a decision and inform XXXX that he has been selected King (no document to attest to this decision or its date, other than XXXX narrative and testimony);\n* December 2016 (exact date unknown)-Depending on XXXX testimony, XXXX attended the XXXX Council meeting with the Cousin in attendance at the same meeting, to inform the Council that he does not accept to be King;\n* January 2017-Appellants acquire U.S.A. VISA's;\n* February 13, 2017-Epe Local Government Notice to Head of XXXX Ruling House seeking candidates for selection as King (i.e. Exhibit P-2).2\n* April 9, 2017-Minutes of the Kingmakers of the XXXX XXXX XXXX Regency in Council decision to select XXXX as the King from the five (5) names submitted for consideration (i.e. Exhibit P-3);\n* July 12, 2017-Appellants flee Nigeria.\n[16] The RAD believes that numbers, time and chronologies of events are indicative and demonstrative of facts; however, facts, as such, can and do become blurred by untruths, inconsistencies, omissions, contradictions and incongruities.\n[17] When XXXX was asked by the RPD, not once but twice3, as to when the final decision about his selection as King was rendered by the XXXX council, he specifically answered that it was November 30, 2016. However, when the RPD asked him for the date that he informed the XXXX Council that he did not want to be King, XXXX could not provide a specific date and he answered with four inconsistent responses. The first answer he provided was in his narrative when he wrote that he informed them \"before\" the decision was rendered4, then during his testimony he answered that he had informed the council after the council had announced their decision (i.e. after |November 30, 2016). Indeed, his exact quote was: \"I told them, no problem, I will have to speak with you before the next meeting\"5 (i.e. at the next meeting after November 30, 2016, since, according to XXXX, the Council's decision was taken at the November 30 meeting). When, during his testimony, he suddenly realized this answer was flawed, XXXX then corrected himself and said, no, I informed them in October 2016 (i.e. changing his answer again for a third time). Finally, XXXX insisted that he informed the Council at a meeting that took place before the November 30, 2016, announcement (i.e. a meeting of unknown date and at which the Cousin was purportedly present, notwithstanding that the Cousin had allegedly threatened XXXX and his family 2 or 3 times during that same period). Moreover, when the RPD asked XXXX why and how he would attend a meeting at which the Cousin from whom he and his family were at that time (i.e. in October) hiding, XXXX simply responded that he had raised up the conviction that the Cousin would not act upon his threats in a public meeting. The RAD finds this latter explanation unsatisfactory and XXXX testimony concerning the date upon which he refused the selection to be inconsistent, incongruous and contradictory; the whole of which undermines XXXX credibility.\n[18] The chronology provided above is sufficiently clear. XXXX was not in his village or, for that matter, in Nigeria at the time of the XXXX Council's announcement on November 30, 2016; nor was he in Ogun State. Rather, he and his family were in Togo, Benin and Ghana as is clearly provided by the wet stamps appearing in their respective passports. His narrative, which is completely silent about his travels (intended or otherwise), denotes that, not only was he in hiding from September 2016, but that he moved his family to Ogun State after the alleged incident of October 13, 2016. XXXX explanation about his attendance at an XXXX Council meeting at which the Cousin was in attendance and which occurred either before or after November 30, 2016 when examined in conjunction with XXXX alleged level of fear for the Appellants' personal security and life, is not a reasonable explanation and is one which not only undermines XXXX credibility but is one from which the RAD draws a negative inference.\nThe Appellants' Movements\/Travels\n[19] The Chronology combined with the evidence submitted in this matter demonstrates that the Appellants did not transparently reveal their travels and movements, thereby blurring the facts of this matter. The RAD notes the existence of a Tanzanian VISA acquired by XXXX prior to the death of the former King but valid through the period during which XXXX testified that his name and the Cousin's name had been selected as possible heirs to the throne. XXXX BoC and narrative are silent about this VISA whether it was used or not. The RAD also notes the wet stamps appearing in each of the Appellants' respective passports which provide that the Appellants, as a family, travelled to Ghana, Benin and Togo States between the period of XXXX XXXX through XXXX XXXX, 2016. These dates are precisely provided in each of the wet stamps and are of particular interest to the RAD because they demonstrate that the Appellants were travelling as a family outside of Nigeria during the precise time line that XXXX testified as being the time frame during which he was purportedly selected and refused his selection as King. XXXX omitted to explain the reasons for these trips in his narrative, remained silent about these trips throughout his testimony without ever providing any satisfactory explanation about the time line discrepancy with these trips and his alleged selection as King. The RAD finds that these omissions, about which XXXX neglected to volunteer any satisfactory explanation, undermine XXXX transparency, the consistency of his assertions and his overall credibility.\n[20] The RAD also notes, as did the RPD, that the Schedule A forms for both XXXX and his wife (forms which both XXXX and his wife solemnly declared to be accurate, complete and true) do not contain any mention of any address at which they would have stayed following any of the alleged threats from the Cousin at any time following the alleged September 2016 incident. In XXXX case there is no mention of any other address than his home address in Lagos following the purported September 2016 incident. As for XXXX wife, there is no mention of any other address than the family's home address in Lagos, following the purported October 2016 incident(s). The RPD specifically asked XXXX about his failure to indicate any transitory Nigerian transitory addresses in his BoC given that he did supply such an address while in Canada. In response, XXXX replied that he was hiding, that he was staying with a friend and that he was not renting the place. The RAD finds these explanations unsatisfactory. XXXX testified that he did not change his home address because he had to ensure documents got to that address but he then changed this testimony to explain that he did not go back to his home address for any other reason than to procure his personal belongings. He then testified that he moved his family to Ogun State in the October 2016 to January 2017 time frame. Yet both his Schedule A form and that of his wife are silent as to any address in Ogun State for that time period, or for any time period thereafter. The RAD, like the RPD, notes these omissions and finds XXXX explanation of them unsatisfactory. The RAD finds XXXX testimony inconsistent with his BoC and his narrative and because his wife also acknowledged the exactitude of XXXX testimony when she was so asked by the RPD6, the RAD cannot help but reach the same conclusion about her testimony.\n[21] Further still, the RAD notes that both XXXX and his wife each acknowledged in their Schedule A forms that they continued to be employed and work at their respective places of work in Lagos until their departure from Nigeria in XXXX 2017. XXXX wife did not provide any satisfactory explanation for this incongruity and, like the RPD, the RAD finds that XXXX testimony about having suddenly become a \"Supervisor\" while he was in \"hiding\" and \"sleeping\" away from his home but being able to work from home as unsatisfactory, inconsistent with and contradictory of the information contained in his narrative, BoC and Schedule A form.\n[22] For all these reasons, the RAD concurs with the RPD's credibility assessment of XXXX and finds that XXXX credibility is sufficiently inconsistent, incongruous and contradictory as to fatally impact the Appellants' allegations.\nAdditional inconsistencies, omissions and contradictions\n[23] Additionally, the RAD noted the following:\n* Appellants' Exhibit P-3 indicates that XXXX name was selected from a \"list of five (5) names\" (i.e. not two names as per XXXX testimony) that were submitted to Orugbo-Iddo Regency Council by the XXXX XXXX XXXX. As such, Appellants' Exhibit P-3 contradicts and is inconsistent with XXXX narrative and testimony; and\n* Appellant's Exhibit P-2 stipulates the following notice to the Head of the XXXX XXXX XXXX:\n\"I hereby write to inform you that, it is the turn of your family to present candidate(s) to Kingmakers within thirty (30) days from the date of this letter to fill the vacant\nStool of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\nHowever, failure to provide name(s) of the candidate(s) to king makers on or before Thirty (30) days, the next ruling house shall be announced according to the declarations. (Underlining added)\n[24] The RAD notes that the above underlined section does not support XXXX testimony or the Appellants' assertions about the potential for any community punishment (extending even to \"death\") for one's refusal of the title as King. XXXX testified that once his name is selected and presented to the Kingmakers, \"there is no going back\". Yet, the Exhibit P-2 simply states that if names are not submitted as \"requested\" (as opposed to \"demanded\") the Kingmakers will simply announce the next ruling house. The RAD notes that the letter does not point out any other serious consequence than the loss of rank for the ruling house. Indeed, unlike as was argued by the Appellants, there appears to be no serious consequences for failure to propose names of candidates to the Kingmakers other than to lose rank to the next ruling house for succession to the throne. The RAD therefore gives little weight to Exhibits P-2 and P-3 as demonstrative of there being any serious consequences for XXXX refusal. Rather, the RAD notes that these Exhibits are more reflective of the RPD's interpretation of the objective documentary evidence-with which the RAD concurs- and that they are, more specifically, demonstrative of the fact that sanctions for refusal of a title are more administrative in nature than they are a threat to life or security of a person.\nOBJECTIVE DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE IN THE NIGERIAN NDP\n[25] Both the RPD and the Appellants cited the same objective evidence from the Nigerian NDP and extracted citations favorable to their respective decisions or positions. The RAD re-examined and re-read Documents 12.10 and 13.7 of the Nigerian NDP,7 each respectively referenced by the Appellants and the RPD. For the reasons provided hereafter, the RAD finds the RPD correctly interpreted the objective evidence and provides its own assessment of the evidence in support of the RPD's finding.\n[26] The documentary evidence concerning the refusal of Chieftaincy titles, be they Yoruba or otherwise, is quite clear; a party who refuses such a title, be it honorific or hereditary in nature, is not seriously at risk to their person or life. The Appellants cited a brief passage from page 5 of the IRB RIR document numbered 103996.E wherein the Advocate and Development planner is quoted as stating that \"at times, [a refusal] might lead to loss of life of the person that refuses to be installed\". The Appellants neglected to cite the majority of the remainder of the same document which, the RAD finds, leans more towards an interpretation that there are no serious sanctions for refusals. As an example, citing an Emeritus Professor of Anthropology and Sociology at the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London, the same document provides that, \" ... in the past, when chieftaincy titles had \"greater social significance\", sometimes individuals rejected family titles that their families wanted them to accept. However, he indicated that as far as he is aware, and \"even in the past\", there were no \"serious sanctions\" for refusals.\" (Italics and underlining added). The same document provides that, sometimes, there were societal \"pressures\", \"challenges\" or \"family embarrassments\" that followed refusals, but overall the document does not demonstrate a serious possibility of persecution for refusal. Moreover, the RAD notes that this latter document is dated in 2012 whereas the other documentation referenced by the RAD, specifically IRB RIR document #NGA104602. E and the French Document appearing at TAB 13.8 of the Nigerian NDP are respectively dated in 2013 and 2015 and both provide that the most serious sanctions, other than pressure upon or embarrassment for the refusal individual (which may cause the individual to move), is that \"some people believe\" that individuals who do refuse have experienced \"magical attacks\", in which people attack them, \"magically or spiritually\". Again, the RAD finds that such evidence does not provide that there is more than a mere possibility of persecution or that, on a balance of probabilities, there is a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment for an individual's refusal of a title.\n[27] The RAD finds that Exhibit P-2 is consistent with the content of the NDP Document found at Tab 12.3. Exhibit P-2, as the RAD cited above, stipulates that the sanction for the failure of the XXXX XXXX XXXX \" ... to provide names of potential candidates shall be to announce the next Ruling House according to the declarations\". This statement is consistent with the findings in Document 12.3 which provides that:\n\"a chieftaincy title may be imposed on someone if hereditary chieftaincy title is being passed through three branches in a family\"; if the successor in one of the branches refuses the title, the community may punish the lineage by denying them the title in the next round of succession.... As abdicating the title may disgrace the person's family.\" (Underlining added)\n[28] Furthermore, the RAD finds that the objective evidence clearly answers the question posed by the Appellants, more specifically, being: \"if there is no consequence to the refusal of the title why does the person have to move anywhere?\"8 The objective evidence clearly establishes that there \"can be\" pressures, challenges and embarrassments related to an individual's refusal of a title which can then lead to an individual believing they need to move. However, the RAD finds that this belief in a need to move is not, on the balance of probabilities, a serious threat to one's security of the person or life and does not fall within the definition of persecution.\n[29] For all these reasons, and with respect to the aforementioned NDP documents, the RAD respectfully disagrees with the Appellants limited citation of document 13.7 and prefers the whole of the country documents over the XXXX testimony relating to the subject matter of said documents which, as found above, is lacking in credibility and filled with omissions, inconsistencies and incongruities.\nDETERMINATION\n[30] For the above reasons, the RAD finds that the Appellants have not established that they face a serious possibility of persecution, or, on a balance of probabilities, a personal risk to their lives or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture. They are neither \"Convention Refugees\" pursuant to Section 96 of the IRPA nor persons in need of protection pursuant to subsection 97 (1) of the IRPA.\n[31] The RAD dismisses the appeal and confirms the decision of the RPD, the whole pursuant to paragraph 111 (1) (a) of the IRPA.\n(signed)\nRobert Cox\nMe Robert Cox\nJanuary 7, 2020\nDate\nRC\/tm\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD File \/ Dossier de la SAR : MB8- 20040\nMB8- 20041 \/ MB8- 20042\/MB8-20043\nRAD.25.02 (April 04, 2019)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n10\nImmigration and Refugee\nBoard of Canada\nRefugee Appeal Division\nCommission de l'immigration\net du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 du Canada\nSection d'appel des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s\nRAD.25.02 (April 04, 2019)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] XXXX XXXX, his wife, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and their daughter, XXXX XXXX, all Haitian citizens, are appealing against the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD), which rejected their claims for refugee protection.\n[2] The appellants have not presented any new evidence on appeal. They have also not asked that a hearing be held before the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD).\n[3] XXXX XXXX XXXX was appointed as the designated representative for her minor daughter XXXX XXXX, and this also extends to the RAD proceedings.\nDETERMINATION OF THE APPEAL\n[4] Pursuant to subsection 111(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), the RAD confirms the determination of the RPD, namely, that the appellants, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, are not \"Convention refugees\" under section 96 of the IRPA or \"persons in need of protection\" within the meaning of section 97 of the IRPA.\n[5] The appeal is dismissed.\nBACKGROUND\n[6] On XXXX XXXX, 2014, while her husband, the male appellant, was in the United States purchasing items for his business, XXXX XXXX XXXX was allegedly the victim of a breaking and entering at her home in Haiti, at which time masked criminals seeking money allegedly raped her. The female appellant allegedly went to the public prosecutor's office to obtain a justice of the peace and then allegedly filed a complaint with the police. The female appellant does not know who these criminals were.\n[7] When the male appellant returned a few days later, he allegedly saw that his business had been XXXX. He believes that it took place because of a political discussion that he had reportedly had.\n[8]\nHaving lost his merchandise XXXX XXXX XXXX, the male appellant feared the pawnbrokers to whom he was indebted because he no longer had the means to repay them. They allegedly visited him three times between XXXX and XXXX 2014, threatening him so that he would pay back the loans. The male appellant allegedly managed to make them wait.\n[9] On XXXX XXXX, 2014, the appellants left Haiti, arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2014, and claimed refugee protection upon their arrival.\n[10] The appellants allegedly learned that on XXXX XXXX, 2014, one of the pawnbrokers went to their home and had asked to see the male appellant.\n[11] The female appellants fear that what happened at the time of the breaking and entering on XXXX XXXX, 2014, will happen again, and the male appellant fears mistreatment at the hands of the pawnbrokers, whom he was unable to reimburse.\nRPD DECISION\n[12] The RPD rejected the appellants' refugee protection claim because they were not credible with respect to their allegations and because the female appellants did not meet their burden of establishing a well-founded fear of persecution under section 96 by reason of their membership in a particular social group, namely, women in Haiti.\n[13] The RPD found that the appellants were not credible for the following reasons:\n- XXXX XXXX XXXX was not credible regarding the breaking and entering and rape incident, which she alleges she was subjected to on XXXX XXXX, 2014. The RPD drew a negative inference from a contradiction between her testimony and the medical document that she submitted into evidence and also from the fact that she never attempted to take cover by changing homes after this incident.\n- XXXX XXXXwas found not credible because he testified that he was threatened almost daily by the pawnbrokers once he returned from the United States on XXXX XXXX, 2014, while it was three times in his Basis of Claim Form (BOC Form).\n- The appellants were found not credible because despite their problems, they waited before applying for a visa for their daughter, a visa they applied for on XXXX XXXX, 2014.\n- Their delays in leaving the country, even though the adult appellants had valid visas for the United States, as well as the fact that they still continued to live at the same address, were factors from which the RPD drew negative inferences with respect to credibility.\n- The fact that the male appellant did not pay the pawnbrokers with the money collected from his close relatives was a factor from which the RPD drew a negative inference with respect to credibility and to the plausibility of the account.\n[14] The RPD also found that the female appellants had not established that their particular and personal circumstances were such that they would face a serious possibility of persecution by reason of their gender.\nGROUNDS OF APPEAL\n[15] Basically, the appellants contend that the RPD erred in finding that they were not credible and that the female appellant would not face a serious possibility of persecution, as a woman fearing rape, should she return to Haiti because, in their opinion, the appellants are credible and XXXX XXXX XXXX has already been sexually assaulted.\n[16] In the appellants' opinion, the RPD erred in the assessment of credibility.\n- The RPD should not have rejected the female appellant's medical document (see the RPD record) and not have drawn negative inferences from the fact that this document did not mention a knee injury. The RPD should have taken into account the fact that this document came from a gynecologist and that it was reasonable for her not to mention the injury.\n-\nThe RPD erred in drawing negative inferences from the fact that the female appellant had not gone to live elsewhere after her assault, while her husband was still outside the country. The RPD should have considered the female appellant's explanation that some neighbours had come to stay with her for a few days.\n- The RPD should not have drawn a negative inference from the principal male appellant's failure to write in his BOC Form that he had been threatened almost daily by the pawnbrokers, because he had instead focused on the violent incidents.\n- The RPD erred by inferring that the delay in applying for a Canadian visa for their daughter appellant was a factor that undermined their credibility.\n- The RPD erred in finding it implausible that the appellants continued to live in the same home in XXXX XXXX XXXX until their departure, even though their lives were in danger. The RPD should have accepted their explanations that wherever they went, they would be in danger.\n- The RPD erred in rejecting the appellants' explanations that they were unable to leave the country until XXXX XXXX, 2014, because they did not have the financial means to do so, and in drawing negative inferences from this delay in leaving their country.\nTHE RAD'S ROLE\n[17] The RAD is a newly constituted appeal tribunal for RPD decisions, whose role remains to be clarified. The IRPA does not explicitly set out the standard of review and intervention to be applied when RPD decisions are appealed.\n[18] To date, Federal Court decisions have established that the RAD is \"a specialized (if not overspecialized) tribunal\" (see Alvarez1) and that Parliament has conferred \"a true appellate function\" on the RAD, \"which sits on appeal of the decisions of another administrative tribunal.\" The RAD \"also has the authority to investigate, an authority the Federal Court judge...does not have.\"\n[19]\nIn Alvarez,2 the Honourable Justice Shore states that \"Parliament seems to have wanted to confer a broad power of intervention on the RAD, thus allowing the RAD to dispose of the merits of appeals and not only to determine whether the RPD's decision was made in a reasonable manner\". The appeals are not de novo, and the RAD can hold a hearing only if new evidence is presented pursuant to subsections 110(3), 110(4) and 110(6) of the IRPA, thus limiting the scope of the appeal that the IRPA confers on the RAD. Moreover, this is not a judicial review whose sole purpose is to determine whether the RPD's decision was reasonable.\n[20] In Eng,3 Justice Shore is of the opinion that although the RAD must show a measure of deference to the RPD, the tribunal of first instance, with regard to findings of fact, as the RPD is better situated, having seen and heard the claimant, the RAD must nonetheless perform its own assessment of all the evidence to determine \"whether the RPD relied on a wrong principle of law or misassessed the facts to the point of making a palpable and overriding error\" (Eng4).\n[21] In Huruglica, Justice Phelan states that \"[i]n conducting its assessment, it can recognize and respect the conclusion of the RPD on such issues as credibility and\/or where the RPD enjoys a particular advantage in reaching such a conclusion\".\n[22] Thus, Huruglica recommends an approach where deference must be given to the RPD with regard to the assessment of credibility, while performing an independent assessment of credibility without limiting itself to \"palpable or overriding error.\" With respect to the assessment of the documentary evidence, the Honourable Justice Phelan is of the opinion that the RAD has expertise that is equal to or greater than that of the RPD \"in the interpretation of country condition evidence. Unlike a court and the supervisory nature of judicial oversight, there is no reason for the RAD to defer to the RPD on this type of assessment.\"5\n[23] In Spasoja, subsequent to Huruglica, the Honourable Justice Roy gives a different view from that of the Honourable Justice Phelan in Huruglica. He states that the standard of review for the RAD must be the standard of \"palpable and overriding error\" for questions of fact, that the RAD must show deference to the RPD's credibility findings, and that for questions of law, the standard of correctness should apply. This conclusion is consistent with Alvarez and Eng.\n[24] In Alyafi,6 Justice Martineau is of the opinion that both positions, the first set out in Alvarez, Eng and Spasoja (palpable and overriding error) and the second in Huruglica (described by Justice Martineau as \"a composite and variable standard of review resulting from the nature of the claim before the RAD-characterized as a hybrid appeal\" (Alyafi, para. 16) can both be applied as long as the question of the scope of the appellate review has not been settled by a final judgment by the Federal Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court of Canada.\n[25] To me, it appears that the RAD must defer to the RPD with respect to its credibility findings, in keeping with the decision in Huruglica, given that the RPD has had the opportunity to see, question and hear the appellant.\n[26] In its assessment, the RAD will consider all the evidence, including the appellant's testimony, and will carry out its own assessment while deferring to the RPD with respect to questions of credibility.\n[27] The RAD will intervene only if it finds that the RPD's findings regarding questions of fact or mixed fact and law are erroneous or are not supported by the evidence, in accordance with subsections 111(1) and 111(2) of the IRPA. The standard of review that the RAD will apply with respect to errors of law is that of correctness (Spasoja).7\nANALYSIS\n[28] The RAD has reviewed the appellants' and the RPD's record, all the documentary evidence and recordings of their hearing before the RPD.\n[29] In light of the evidence on the record, the RAD is of the opinion that the RPD did not err.\n[30] The female appellant testified that she sustained a serious leg injury inflicted by the criminals, who allegedly brandished their knives at the time of the incident on XXXX XXXX, 2014. This resulted in the female appellant allegedly sustaining a deep cut on her leg, which, she testified, left a visible scar.\n[31] The following day, the female appellant allegedly went to see a doctor (this visit is not in the BOC Form) who allegedly wrote her a medical certificate (see the RPD record, page 469). The diagnosis on this certificate does not indicate that the female appellant sustained a knee injury. It appears that, according to the medical certificate, this examination was carried out as part of a general consultation at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX [state university hospital of Haiti] the day after the incident on XXXX XXXX, 2014.\n[32] In the circumstances and contrary to the appellants' arguments, although the doctor was a gynecologist, it appears unlikely that in a general examination (the female appellant did not testify that this was a gynecological examination), the doctor would have failed to mention a visible and considerable injury that had specifically been the basis for the consultation, as it was one of the reasons she went for the consultation (see the RPD book, BOC Form, page 57). It is entirely consistent that an allusion to this injury should have been on this medical certificate. That this injury is not mentioned on it fundamentally undermines the appellants' credibility with respect to this incident in the RAD's view.\n[33] The RPD did not err.\n[34] The female appellant was questioned as to why, after the incident on XXXX XXXX, 2014, she had not sought refuge elsewhere.\n[35] It took her a few times and a few answers before she stated that some neighbours had come and slept at her place. At first, she answered that following the incident she no longer felt like herself, that she was really upset and that nothing made any sense to her anymore. To a question asked by the RPD ([translation] \"Could you not go and stay with your family?\"), the female appellant answered that it was not safe anywhere.\n[36] The account in the BOC Form demonstrates that on XXXX XXXX, the female appellant took a number of steps, including a trip to the peace tribunal, that she then went to file a complaint with the police, and that she bought a chip so that she could call her husband, which she did. She then allegedly went to the hospital, where she apparently spent the entire day, from 9:00 am to 6:00 pm.\n[37] Consequently, in the RAD's opinion, the explanations that the female appellant was not feeling like herself and was really upset are not credible, because she allegedly took various steps that demonstrate that she made sense of time and place, that she was not overcome by her emotions and that rational thought prevailed because she went to a number of places in order to find a solution to her problems, taking steps regarding her complaint (the female appellant did not produce a copy of this complaint into evidence). Since she was able to travel and had her wits about her enough to go and take these steps, the RAD finds that it is not credible that the female appellants, once the principal female appellant left the hospital on XXXX XXXX, 2014, had not thought or wanted to go hide somewhere else, thus protecting her children and herself, and escaping violence and this ransacked place where the incident had transpired, whether neighbours had come or not.\n[38] The RAD draws a negative inference regarding the credibility of this incident on XXXX XXXX, 2014. The RAD did not believe it. In its opinion, the RPD did not err in this matter.\n[39] The RAD is also of the opinion that the RPD was right to find that it was unlikely, in the circumstances alleged by the appellants, that the pawnbrokers threatened the male appellant almost daily and that they did not attempt to seek cover and continued to live at the same place. The explanations that it was of no use to do so because they would have found them elsewhere seems inconsistent and implausible to the RAD.\n[40] In a country such as Haiti where, according to the documentary evidence (see the RPD record, national documentation package, pages 100 to 134), there are high rates of violence and organized crime in relation to the overall poverty and social problems that stem from them, it is easy to believe that if the male appellant had really taken out a usurious loan with criminals and had defaulted on a $XXXX payment, a considerable amount in a country lacking resources like Haiti, in light of the threats that he states he received, the male appellant would have been in a hurry to put his family in a place other than at his home so that it would be more difficult to find them. The RAD did not believe the male appellant's explanation that they would have been found wherever they went. Logically, the risk would be much higher if the appellants stayed in the same place, especially because the pawnbrokers had come to their home.\n[41] Moreover, the appellants did not write that they had been threatened almost daily by the pawnbrokers in their BOC Form. The male appellant explained that this was a mistake.\n[42] The arguments in the appellants' memorandum (appellants' record, page 12) that they focused only on the violent incidents cannot be accepted, as they did not testify to this before the RPD.\n[43] The RAD is of the opinion that this omission is significant and that if the appellants really had received daily threats in relation to these loans, this would have been indicated in their BOC Form.\n[44] The RPD did not err; the RAD finds that the appellants are not credible in this matter and that there was no unpaid usurious loan or resulting threats.\n[45] Lastly, the RPD did not believe that the appellants' business had been XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2014, because the appellants waited a number of months before leaving the country on XXXX XXXX, 2014.\n[46] It should be noted that XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX had valid American visas. They also had valid Canadian visas-the female appellant since XXXX 2014 and the male appellant since XXXX 2012.\n[47] In the circumstances, why did they not apply for a visa for the female appellant, XXXX XXXX, until XXXX XXXX, 2014? The appellants stated that it was an issue of financial resources. The RAD rejects this explanation, not believing, as was previously explained, the assault on XXXX XXXX, 2014; the loans taken out; the resulting threats; or the XXXX business. As the male appellant stated that he was able to collect some funds through his close relatives-and on this point, he did not express anything to indicate that he encountered any obstacles-the RAD is of the opinion that funds could have been used before the XXXX XXXX XXXX2014 to take steps toward a Canadian visa. The RPD did not err in its assessment of the credibility on this point.\n[48] That being said, could the female appellants have a well-founded fear of persecution by reason of their gender, should they return to Haiti?\n[49] The RPD concluded no because they had not shown that their personal characteristics put them at risk of being raped under section 96 of the IRPA.\n[50] The female appellants are of the opinion, in their memorandum, that they credibly demonstrated that in the context in which they live and that of their personal situation, they face a serious possibility of persecution by reason of their gender.\n[51] It is unnecessary to demonstrate past persecution in order to establish a prospective fear of persecution. This is a line well established by the Canadian case law in the matter.\n[52] The fear expressed by the female appellants is that at any time, because of the general insecurity in Haiti, they could again fall victim to violence like that on XXXX XXXX, 2014. The truthfulness of this incident was not established by the female appellants. Consequently, the RAD is of the opinion that, prospectively, despite the fact that women in Haiti can be the subject of physical, sexual and psychological violence (see the RPD record, pages 13 to 45), the female appellants did not establish that the context in which they live and their personal situation are such that they have a well-founded fear of persecution by reason of their gender. The female appellants are members of a family, are not alone and benefit from the presence of XXXX XXXX. They lived in a house, and this house still exists according to the BOC Form (see RPD record, BOC Form page 58). They did not establish that they would return to vulnerable conditions such that they would be at risk as women or would face a serious possibility of being persecuted there.\n[53] Given that the negative inferences regarding credibility drawn by the RPD are, in the RAD's opinion, crucial and determinative in the female appellant's account and that the female appellants failed to establish that they had a well-founded fear of persecution by reason of their gender, the RAD is of the opinion that the RPD rendered the correct decision and did not err.\nREMEDY\n[54] For these reasons, I confirm the determination of the RPD, namely, that XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX are not \"Convention refugees\" under section 96 of the IRPA or \"persons in need of protection\" within the meaning of section 97 of the IRPA.\n[55] The appeal is dismissed.\nRoxane Cyr\nRoxane Cyr\nAugust 5, 2015\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD File No. \/ No de dossier de la SAR : MB5-00516\nMB5-00517 MB5-00518\n12\n",

DETERMINATION OF THE APPEAL\n[2] Pursuant to subsection 111(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the Act), the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) dismisses the appeal and confirms the determination of the RPD, namely, that XXXX XXXX is neither a \"Convention refugee\" pursuant to section 96 of the Act, nor a \"person in need of protection\" pursuant to section 97 of the Act.\nII. BACKGROUND\nA. Basis of the claim\n[3] In the Basis of Claim Form (BOC Form) he signed on April 8, 2013, the appellant states that he is a citizen of India, that his father and mother were living in India at that moment and that his sister was living in Canada at the moment.1\n[4] In the same BOC Form, the appellant also states that he would be subjected to harm, mistreatment and threats if he were to return to his country, given that, according to what his family has told him, he is being sought by the police and he could even be killed. He also states that, in the past, namely, in XXXX and XXXX 2011, he was detained, falsely accused, beaten and tortured by the police.2\n[5] In the same BOC Form, the appellant states that his family asked the police for help, but they refused to help them, that his father approached a member of parliament for the region, but in vain, and that the police arrested him on false allegations.3\n[6] In the same BOC Form, the appellant states that he did not move to another part of the country to seek safety because he was a minor and he hoped to be able to finish school, which he was not able to do because of problems with the police. He also states that, if he left his country on XXXX XXXX, 2011, and not earlier or later, it is because he left the country at the point in time when the police were creating problems for him and it had become dangerous for him to remain in India.4\nB. RPD decision\n[7] The hearing before the RPD was held on June 4, 2013. In its decision dated June 21, 2013, the RPD rejects the appellant's claim for refugee protection. In its reasons, the RPD states that it is satisfied as to the appellant's identity. It states that credibility is the determinative issue and that [translation] \"the accumulation of omissions, inconsistencies and contradictions that were not explained in a satisfactory fashion when the opportunity arose\" caused it to find that [translation] \"the refugee protection claimant is not credible with respect to his description of events and the persecution he claimed to have suffered at the hands of thugs affiliated with Akali and the police.\"5\nC. Grounds of appeal\n[8] The appellant gives two grounds of appeal in his memorandum.6 First, he criticizes the RPD for erring in its assessment of his credibility. Second, he criticizes the RPD for ignoring the documentary evidence filed concerning an internal flight alternative.\nD. Remedy sought\n[9] For these reasons, the appellant requests that the RAD set aside the determination of the RPD and grant him refugee status.7\nIII. ADMISSIBILITY OF EVIDENCE PRESENTED ON APPEAL\nA. Test for admissibility\n[10] Subsection 110(4) of the Act states that the person who is the subject of the appeal may present only evidence that arose after the rejection of their claim or that was not reasonably available, or that the person could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection.\n110. (4) On appeal, the person who is the subject of the appeal may present only evidence that arose after the rejection of their claim or that was not reasonably available, or that the person could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection.\n110. (4) Dans le cadre de l'appel, la personne en cause ne peut pr\u00e9senter que des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve survenus depuis le rejet de sa demande ou qui n'\u00e9taient alors pas normalement accessibles ou, s'ils l'\u00e9taient, qu'elle n'aurait pas normalement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s, dans les circonstances, au moment du rejet.\n[11] The RAD Rules provide that the record of the person who is the subject of the appeal must contain, among other documents, a written statement indicating whether the appellant is relying on any evidence referred to in subsection 110(4) of the Act, and a memorandum that includes full and detailed submissions regarding how this evidence meets the requirements of subsection 110(4) of the Act and how that evidence relates to the appellant.8\n[12] Given the wording of subsection 110(4) of the Act, which is very similar to that regarding new evidence admissible for a pre-removal risk assessment (PRRA), I am of the opinion that, as a result, it is necessary to apply mutatis mutandis the factors developed by jurisprudence for the PRRA and to answer the questions established in Raza concerning credibility, relevance, newness and materiality of the evidence presented, and to determine whether the evidence presented on appeal is admissible or whether, on the contrary, it should be excluded from the appeal.9\n[13] The fact that the evidence corroborates the facts, contradicts findings of the RPD or clarifies the evidence before the RPD does not make it \"new evidence\" under subsection 110(4) of the Act. If it did, the refugee protection claimant could split their case and present evidence to the RAD at the appeal stage which could have been presented from the outset, at the RPD stage.10 In my opinion, this is exactly the wrong subsection 110(4) of the Act prohibits.\nB. Appellant submitted documents on appeal\n[14] In his affidavit, which he signed on July 24, 2013, the appellant states that his counsel would be filing new documents as Exhibit A-1 in the appeal, namely, two affidavits and a medical certificate.11 In his memorandum, the appellant submits that the Act clearly states that the RAD can accept documents in evidence and that the documents he was submitting as Exhibit A-1 were not in his possession at the time of the hearing before the RPD.12\nC. Decision of the RAD on admissibility\n[15] I have come to the conclusion that the evidence submitted by the appellant after the RPD's decision is not admissible. Here is why.\ni) Medical certificate dated XXXX XXXX, 2012\n[16] This document filed before the RAD as Exhibit A-1 was signed by Dr. XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2012, and concerns XXXX XXXX, the appellant's father.\n[17] In the case of a PRRA, if a document is dated before the RPD decision, jurisprudence has established that the officer may exclude the document when the person in question has not shown that the document was not reasonably available or, if it was, that the person could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to present it before the RPD.13\n[18] The appellant does not establish in either his memorandum or his written statement that this medical certificate, dated XXXX 2012, was not reasonably available at the time of his refugee protection hearing. He also fails to establish why he could not reasonably have been expected to present it at the time of his refugee protection hearing. And finally, he also fails to establish why, if this medical certificate, dated XXXX 2012, was available at the time of his refugee protection hearing, he did not, in the circumstances, present it at his refugee protection hearing.\n[19] According to jurisprudence, in the context of the PRRA, if any one of the five questions identified in Raza can be answered in the positive, the evidence can be excluded or found to be inadmissible.14\n[20] That being said, and although not necessary, I add that the appellant also failed to provide a specific and detailed explanation as to how the medical certificate dated December 2012 offers material evidence. In other words, he failed to show how the appellant's refugee protection claim would probably have succeeded if the evidence in this medical certificate had been made available to the RPD.\n[21] It has been clearly established that, in the context of the PRRA, the burden of proving the materiality of evidence lies with the applicant.15 I am of the opinion that the same goes for the admissibility of evidence in this appeal. Consequently, by failing to provide full and detailed submissions regarding the materiality of the medical certificate, the appellant did not meet his burden of proof in this regard. It must be remembered that in every proceeding, including an administrative proceeding, one party has the burden of proof: \"Where the existence of a particular fact is at issue, uncertainty is resolved by asking whether or not the burden has been discharged with respect to that fact.\"16\n[22] Be that as it may, in my opinion, if the medical certificate dated XXXX 2012 had been brought to the RPD's attention, it certainly could have persuaded the RPD to acknowledge that in XXXX 2012 the appellant's father had been a victim of blows that caused injuries, but this evidence alone cannot be determinative of whether the appellant had a well-founded fear of persecution or whether he faced a personalized risk to his life or of being subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if he were to return to India.\n[23] For these reasons, in light of subsection 110(4) of the Act and relevant jurisprudence, I conclude that this medical certificate dated December 2012 is inadmissible in this appeal.\nii) Affidavit from a cousin of the appellant's father, dated XXXX XXXX, 2013\n[24] This affidavit is dated XXXX XXXX, 2013, slightly less than a month after the RPD's decision rejecting the appellant's claim for refugee protection had been made. That being said, the newness of documentary evidence does not depend solely on the date on which the document was created; what is important is the event or circumstance sought to be proved by the documentary evidence.17 This affidavit clearly tries to prove that the appellant's father and his family have been living in the village of XXXX XXXX XXXX for the previous three months, namely, since XXXX XXXX, 2013.\n[25] The appellant does not establish in either his memorandum or his written statement that the information that his father and his family had been living in the village of XXXX XXXX XXXX since XXXX XXXX, 2013, was not reasonably available at the time of the refugee protection hearing . He also does not establish that he could not reasonably have been expected to have presented it at the refugee protection hearing. Finally, he also does not establish why, if this information was available at the time of his refugee protection hearing, he could not have been expected, in the circumstances, have presented it at his refugee protection hearing.\n[26] For these reasons, I conclude that this affidavit is inadmissible in this appeal.\niii) Affidavit from a sarpanch, dated XXXX XXXX, 2013\n[27] This affidavit is dated XXXX XXXX, 2013, nearly a month after the RPD's decision rejecting the appellant's claim for refugee protection had been made. That being said, the newness of documentary evidence does not depend solely on the date on which the document was created; what is important is the event or circumstance sought to be proved by the documentary evidence.18 This affidavit obviously tries to prove that the appellant's father and his spouse have encountered problems because of the Punjabi police and that, in XXXX 2012, they left the village of XXXX in Sangrur district because of these problems.\n[28] The appellant does not establish in either his memorandum or his written statement that the information that his father and mother had encountered problems because of the Punjabi police and that, in XXXX 2012, they left the village of XXXX in Sangrur district because of these problems was not reasonably available at the time of his refugee protection hearing. He also does not establish that he could not reasonably have been expected to have presented it at the time of his refugee protection hearing. Finally, he also does not establish why, if this information was available at the time of his refugee protection hearing, he could not have been expected, in the circumstances, have presented it at his refugee protection hearing.\n[29] For these reasons, I conclude that this affidavit is inadmissible in this appeal.\nIV. HEARING BEFORE THE RAD\nA. The appellant requested that a hearing be held\n[30] The RAD Rules state that the record of the person who is the subject of the appeal must include a written statement indicating whether the appellant is requesting that a hearing be held under subsection 110(6) of the Act, as well as a memorandum that includes full and detailed submissions regarding why the RAD should hold such a hearing, if the appellant is requesting that a hearing be held.19\n[31] In his memorandum, the appellant asks the RAD either to obtain a written transcript or to listen to the entire sound recording of the hearing before the RPD, or to hold a hearing, alleging that his credibility is the reason his claim was rejected by the RPD.20\n[32] If the RAD had to hold a hearing every time the RPD rejected a claim on the ground of credibility, the appeal proceeding would be equivalent to a de novo appeal of the claim for refugee protection. In my opinion, this is clearly not the intent of the Act. It should be pointed out that, under subsection 110(3) of the Act, the RAD generally proceeds without a hearing, on the basis of the record of the proceedings of the RPD:\n110. (3) Subject to subsections (3.1), (4) and (6), the Refugee Appeal Division must proceed without a hearing, on the basis of the record of the proceedings of the Refugee Protection Division, and may accept documentary evidence and written submissions from the Minister and the person who is the subject of the appeal and, in the case of a matter that is conducted before a panel of three members, written submissions from a representative or agent of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and any other person described in the rules of the Board.\n110. (3) Sous r\u00e9serve des paragraphes (3.1), (4) et (6), la section proc\u00e8de sans tenir d'audience en se fondant sur le dossier de la Section de la protection des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s, mais peut recevoir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve documentaire et des observations \u00e9crites du ministre et de la personne en cause ainsi que, s'agissant d'une affaire tenue devant un tribunal constitu\u00e9 de trois commissaires, des observations \u00e9crites du repr\u00e9sentant ou mandataire du Haut-Commissariat des Nations Unies pour les r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s et de toute autre personne vis\u00e9e par les r\u00e8gles de la Commission.\nB. Test under subsection 110(6)\n[33] Pursuant to subsection 110(6) of the Act, when evidence presented on appeal is found to be admissible, it should be determined whether it raises a serious issue with respect to the credibility of the person who is the subject of the appeal, whether it is central to the decision with respect to the refugee protection claim, and whether it would justify allowing or rejecting the refugee protection claim. In the context of the PRRA, this has been interpreted to be a conjunctive test.21 If the answer is affirmative, the RAD may then hold a hearing.\n110. (6) The Refugee Appeal Division may hold a hearing if, in its opinion, there is documentary evidence referred to in subsection (3)\n(a) that raises a serious issue with respect to the credibility of the person who is the subject of the appeal;\n(b) that is central to the decision with respect to the refugee protection claim; and\n(c) that, if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the refugee protection claim.\n110. (6) La section peut tenir une audience si elle estime qu'il existe des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve documentaire vis\u00e9s au paragraphe (3) qui, \u00e0 la fois :\na) soul\u00e8vent une question importante en ce qui concerne la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de la personne en cause;\nb) sont essentiels pour la prise de la d\u00e9cision relative \u00e0 la demande d'asile;\nc) \u00e0 supposer qu'ils soient admis, justifieraient que la demande d'asile soit accord\u00e9e ou refus\u00e9e, selon le cas.\nC. No cause to hold a hearing before the RAD\n[34] In the present appeal, I have already concluded that the evidence presented by the appellant after the RPD hearing is not admissible for the purposes of this appeal. Consequently, there is no cause to hold a hearing.\nV. STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n[35] A standard of review analysis need not be conducted in every instance. Where the standard of review applicable to a particular question is well-settled by past jurisprudence, the standard of review may be adopted. Based on jurisprudence, I am of the opinion that only where this search proves fruitless must this analysis be conducted.22\n[36] In this case, I need to point out that the RAD is not a court of law and does not review RPD decisions, but rather hears appeals in an administrative and non-judicial context. The RPD and RAD are both part of the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB), but they are two distinct divisions.23 Sections 162 to 169 of the Act identify the provisions that apply to them both, particularly that each \"has, in respect of proceedings brought before it under this Act, sole and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine all questions of law and fact, including questions of jurisdiction,\"24 that the members have the powers and authority of a commissioner and may do any other thing they consider necessary to provide a full and proper hearing,25 and that hearings are held in the absence of the public, although each may conduct a proceeding in public, taking any other measure that it considers necessary to ensure the appropriate access to the proceedings.26 Sections 169.1 to 170.2 of the Act are specific to the RPD, while sections 171 to 171.1 are specific to the RAD.\n[37] Under subsection 110(1) of the Act, \"a person or the Minister may appeal, on a question of law, of fact or of mixed law and fact, to the Refugee Appeal Division against a decision of the Refugee Protection Division to allow or reject the person's claim for refugee protection.\"According to subsection 111(1) of the Act, the RAD \"shall make one of the following decisions: (a) confirm the determination of the Refugee Protection Division; (b) set aside the determination and substitute a determination that, in its opinion, should have been made; or (c) refer the matter to the Refugee Protection Division for re-determination, giving the directions to the Refugee Protection Division that it considers appropriate.\" Subsection 111(2) states that the RAD may make the referral described in paragraph (1)(c) only if it is of the opinion that\n(a) the decision of the Refugee Protection Division is wrong in law, in fact or in mixed law and fact; and\n(b) it cannot make a decision under paragraph 111(1)(a) or (b) without hearing evidence that was presented to the Refugee Protection Division.\n[38] When analyzing the respective roles of two administrative tribunals and deciding which standard of review the Law Enforcement Review Board should apply in determining an appeal against a decision made by an officer tasked with hearing a complaint about a police officer's conduct, the Alberta Court of Appeal noted that the mere presence of a right to appeal-including within an administrative structure-in no way means that no deference to the first-level decision-maker is called for.27\n[39] In its decision, the Court of Appeal referred to the example of the relationship established between a trial judge and an appeal judge:\nThe presumption underlying the structure of our court system is that a trial judge is competent to decide the case before him or her, and that a just and fair outcome will result from the trial process. Frequent and unlimited appeals would undermine this presumption and weaken public confidence in the trial process. An appeal is the exception rather than the rule.28\n[40] Citing the Supreme Court of Canada, the Court of Appeal emphasized the importance of promoting the autonomy of the proceeding and its integrity, adding that the same principle applies within administrative matters:\nThe same principle applies to the hearings before the presiding officers. If the Board was to continue to routinely rehear all matters on a de novo basis, and to extend no deference whatsoever to the decisions of the presiding officers, that would only undermine the apparent integrity of those hearings. As previously stated, that is inconsistent with the hybrid scheme of the Act. As the appellant noted, that approach undermines those hearings to the point that they become almost academic, and call into question the need of the interested parties to even participate in them. The hearing would be reduced to a type of preliminary inquiry.29\n[41] I am also of the opinion that the expertise of the first-level decision-maker and the advantaged position of that person need to be recognized, as the Supreme Court did with the trial judge:\nThe trial judge is better situated to make factual findings owing to his or her extensive exposure to the evidence, the advantage of hearing testimony viva voce, and the judge's familiarity with the case as a whole. Because the primary role of the trial judge is to weigh and assess voluminous quantities of evidence, the expertise and insight of the trial judge in this area should be respected.30\n[42] Having considered the respective roles of the decision-makers, their particular expertise and the general economy of the proceedings at issue, the Alberta Court of Appeal identified which standards of review the Law Enforcement Review Board should apply to decisions rendered by the decision-maker of first instance:\n[82] In conclusion, the decision of the Board to conduct a de novo hearing, and to assume that it owed no deference to the findings of the presiding officer was in error. The role of the Board is primarily to sit on appeal from the presiding officer. The Board is not a tribunal of first instance, and cannot simply ignore the proceedings before the presiding officer, and the conclusions reached by him. The focus of the appeal to the Board should be on its dual mandate of civilian oversight, and the correction of unreasonable results.\n[83] There is no general power to hold a de novo hearing in every case, and no requirement that a de novo hearing be held unless the parties consent to proceeding otherwise. Where a sufficient reason is shown or the issues on appeal warrant it, the Board has the power to admit fresh evidence. When sufficient cause is shown the Board can even rehear key evidence presented to the presiding officer.\n[84] The Board has a legitimate role to play in providing civilian oversight to the system of police discipline where oversight issues arise. The Board is not bound by the inferences and conclusions of the presiding officer, but it should be able to offer some articulable reason based in law, fact or policy when it interferes with a decision under appeal. The Board should proceed primarily from the record created by the hearing before the presiding officer. It should extend deference to the decision of the presiding officer on questions of fact, credibility, and technical policing issues. If the decision of the presiding officer was reasonable, the Board should not substitute its own view just because it might have come to a different conclusion. Where the appeal raises issues of acceptability of particular police conduct, or the integrity of the discipline process, the Board's mandate is more robust.31\n[43] Based on the reasoning of the Alberta Court of Appeal and the factors identified in its analysis in Newton, and making the necessary adaptations for the RPD's and RAD's particular context, I am of the opinion that, except for strict questions of law or of natural justice, it is appropriate for RAD members to extend the same deference to RPD decisions. This deference is, in fact, comparable to the deference to be given by courts of law to first-level decision-makers where the issue is a question of fact or a question of mixed law and fact.\n[44] The appellant gives two grounds for appeal in his memorandum.32 First, he criticizes the RPD for having erred in its assessment of his credibility. Then, he criticizes the RPD for ignoring the documentary evidence submitted on the subject of an internal flight alternative. That being said, the appellant did not specify what standard of review should be applied with respect to his grounds of appeal. Relying on the Federal Court's jurisprudence, I am of the opinion that these two grounds of appeal concern the assessment of the evidence by the RPD and that the applicable standard of review in this case is reasonableness.33\n[45] Reasonableness is concerned with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process, and whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law.34\nVI. ANALYSIS OF THE MERITS OF THE APPEAL\nDid the RPD commit one or more errors in its assessment of the appellant's credibility?\n[46] I have come to the conclusion that the RPD did not err in its assessment of the appellant's credibility. Here is why.\n[47] In his memorandum, the appellant criticizes the RPD for drawing negative conclusions regarding his credibility without taking into account the corrections made to his BOC Form before the hearing, as well as his explanations during the hearing and the fact that he was a minor during the events that occurred on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, 2011, and when he signed his BOC Form, and the fact that the questions asked dealt with his father's actions, not his own.35\n[48] He also criticizes the RPD for not taking into consideration when analyzing his internal flight alternative the fact that his father paid $30,000 Canadian for him to leave the country or the abundant documentary evidence that he submitted on the subject.36\n[49] In the reasons for its decision, the RPD states that credibility is the determinative issue and that [translation] \"the accumulation of omissions, inconsistencies and contradictions that were not explained in a satisfactory fashion when the opportunity arose\" caused it to find that [translation] \"the refugee protection claimant is not credible with respect to his description of events and the persecution he claims to have suffered at the hand of by thugs affiliated with Akali and the police.37 Here are the appellant's omissions, contradictions and inconsistencies that the RPD identified in its decision and the conclusions that it reached.\n[50] First, with respect to the omissions from the original BOC Form and what the RPD identified as contradictions in the appellant's explanations:\n[translation]\n[13] At the beginning of the hearing, the claimant filed an addition to his BOC Form. He alleged, among other things, that during these two arrests, his family paid a bribe for his release. He added that since he has been living in Canada, the police and thugs have harassed his family and asked about him and his sister. His father was beaten. Furthermore, his parents have had to move and are trying to leave India.\n[14] When asked to explain why he made his additions at the last moment, the claimant stated that his previous lawyer had not asked him those questions. The panel pointed out to the claimant that this information is important and that it would be reasonable to expect that it be included in his initial account since it is central to his claim for refugee protection. The claimant replied that the person completed his BOC Form and told him to give this information on the day of the hearing. The panel does not accept this explanation because the form clearly states that all important information must be included. The panel is of the opinion that if his father had been beaten by the police, the claimant would have mentioned it at the beginning. These last-minute additions to his BOC Form undermine the claimant's credibility.\n[15] Moreover, when confronted with the fact that he had indicated in his BOC Form that his parents were still living in the village, the claimant explained that he did not learn until after XXXX XXXX, 2013, namely, after he had signed his BOC Form, that his parents had left their village in XXXX 2012 to go into hiding. This explanation contradicts the one given earlier in which he stated that he was to give this information on the day of the hearing. Once again, this undermines the claimant's credibility.\n[16] When asked to explain the circumstances of the XXXX XXXX, 2011, attack, the claimant stated that these thugs attacked them because they blamed the claimant and his sister for having gone to the police to complain about harassment. When confronted with the fact that he did not include this information in his BOC Form, the claimant stated that he did not know why this was not included in his BOC Form. Given that, according to the claimant, the harassment complaint was one of the reasons for the attack, the panel is of the opinion that this important information should have been included in the claimant's account and consequently, the panel finds that this omission undermines the claimant's credibility regarding the XXXX XXXX, 2011, attack....\n[19] Moreover, the fact that his father had threatened the police by stating that he would go to higher authorities was not mentioned in his BOC Form. When asked about this important omission, the claimant replied that he did not know why the information was not there. This omission from the BOC Form further undermines the claimant's credibility. In fact, the claimant testified at the beginning of the hearing that his BOC Form was complete, correct and completed to the best of his knowledge, and that he had nothing to add. This omission is particularly significant because, during the hearing, the claimant stated that one of the reasons why he was arrested on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2011, was precisely because his father tried to complain to higher authorities. This further undermines his credibility.\n[20] Furthermore, when asked to explain why he failed to mention in his BOC Form that his father had paid bribes of 30,000 rupees for his release, the claimant stated first that he simply answered the questions that he was asked. Then he added that paying bribes is not a good thing, which is why he did not mention it. Finally, he stated that he did not think of mentioning this information. The panel rejects all these explanations, which it considers contradictory, and finds that the omission of this information from the BOC Form undermines the credibility of the claimant's account.\n[21] When the panel asked whether the claimant had been further annoyed by the police or thugs between late XXXX2011 and the day he left the country in XXXX 2012, the claimant replied that the police allegedly came to their home once or twice to ask questions. When confronted with the fact that this information was not included in his BOC Form, the claimant replied that he did not think of it. The panel is of the opinion that if the police had come back after his release on XXXX XXXX, 2011, the claimant would not have forgotten to mention it in his account. This omission once again undermines the claimant's credibility.38\n[51] Then, with respect to the inconsistency between the appellant's behaviour and the fears that he alleges he has:\n[translation]\n[22] The claimant also stated during his testimony that, after his second arrest on XXXX XXXX, 2011, he made the decision, with his father's agreement, to leave the country for his safety. He left his country the first time in XXXX 2011 for Thailand, where he stayed five days, before returning to his village. He left again in XXXX 2012 for France, where he also stayed for five days, before returning to the family home. According to the claimant, his father paid approximately $30,000 Canadian to an agent to accompany his son and take him to safety.\n[23] When he went back to India in XXXX 2012, the claimant continued going to school until his exams in XXXX 2012, and then left India in XXXX 2012 to come to Canada, where he waited until a year after his arrival to claim refugee protection.\n[24] When confronted with the fact that he did not claim refugee protection during his travels and that he voluntarily returned to India each time, the claimant explained that he did what his agent told him to do. When confronted with the long delay in claiming refugee protection in Canada, the claimant stated that he did not know and that he did what his uncle told him to do.\n[25] The panel is of the opinion that this behaviour is not representative of the behaviour of a reasonable person who fears for his life. The courts have decided numerous times that not filing a claim for refugee protection in a country that is signatory to the Convention or delaying in doing so is inconsistent with the actions of a person with a subjective fear of persecution.\n[26] The panel is aware of the fact that the claimant was only sixteen when this occurred. Nevertheless, he was assisted and advised by his family, namely, his parents, his uncles or his sister who is an engineering student in Canada. Moreover, the claimant clearly stated at the beginning of the hearing that he came to Canada to save his life. Consequently, the explanations given, namely, that he was young and did what his relatives decided, are not satisfactory from the panel's point of view.\n[27] In fact, if the claimant had really been in danger, it is reasonable to think that his parents would not have paid large sums of money to an agent to take their son outside the country for just a few days and then to bring him back to the family home, where he continued his education as if nothing had happened. The panel is also of the opinion that if the claimant's life were in danger in India, if his family had been harassed and if his father had been beaten by the police, the claimant, with the help of his uncle, who is a Canadian citizen, would have acted to claim refugee protection in Canada as quickly as possible.\n[28] The claimant's erratic behaviour combined with his unsatisfactory explanations regarding the fact that he twice returned to the family home, a favourite place although he alleged that he was sought there, leads the panel to conclude that the claimant does not have a subjective fear.39\n[52] My role in this appeal is not to reweigh the evidence,40 or to conduct a microscopic examination of the RPD's decision, but rather to determine whether, when analyzed as a whole, the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law.41\n[53] Jurisprudence has clearly established that the RPD can reasonably base its negative findings with respect to credibility on the omissions and contradictions between the oral testimony and the written statements made before the hearing. Jurisprudence has also clearly established that it is open to the RPD to reject an explanation provided regarding such omissions when it is unsatisfactory.42\n[54] In his BOC Form, the appellant attested that the information in the form was complete, true and correct, that the entire contents of the form had been translated for him, and that he acknowledged that his declaration had the same force and effect as if made under oath.43 He was represented by a lawyer during his hearing before the RPD, and he made changes to the form, as the RPD Rules allow.44\n[55] During the hearing, the RPD brought up the fact that there were several omissions from the appellant's original BOC Form, namely, the fact that, since he has been living in Canada, the police and thugs have harassed his family and have been looking for him and his sister, his father has been beaten, and his parents have had to move to a new location and are trying to leave India. As well, his father has threatened the police by stating that he will go to higher authorities, his father paid bribes of 30,000 rupees for his release, and he, the appellant, received one or two visits from the police between late XXXX 2011 and XXXX 2012.\n[56] During the hearing, when asked to explain these omissions, the appellant provided answers that the RPD did not consider satisfactory. For example, with respect to the additions submitted at the beginning of the RPD hearing, the appellant replied that his counsel at the time did not ask him those questions. As the RPD correctly indicated in its decision, [translation] \"the form clearly indicates that all important information must be included.\" In fact, according to Federal Court jurisprudence, all relevant and important facts should be included in the BOC Form, and the oral testimony at the hearing should go on to explain the information in the BOC Form.45 To other examples regarding his failure to mention in his BOC Form that, on XXXX XXXX, 2011, thugs attacked him and his sister because they had filed a complaint about harassment, and that his father had threatened the police by stating that he would go to higher authorities, the appellant replied that he did not know why this information was missing from his BOC form. These answers are certainly not an explanation for these two omissions from his BOC Form. To another example regarding the failure to mention in his BOC Form that his father had paid bribes, the appellant replied that paying bribes was not a good thing and he did not think to mention this information in his BOC Form. Once again, this answer is not reasonable when, by signing his BOC Form, the appellant declared that the information in the form was complete, true and correct. Consequently, I am of the opinion that the RPD could reasonably conclude that the various omissions from the original BOC Form undermined the appellant's credibility.\n[57] Now, with respect to the behaviour of the appellant, who left his country, who went to a country where he could have claimed refugee protection but did not do so, who then returned to his country and went back to school for a few months, and who then left for Canada where he filed a claim for refugee protection long after his arrival, the RPD took into account the fact that the appellant was a minor at the time. However, it decided, after also taking into account the fact that his family was helping him and advising him, that his behaviour was not representative of the behaviour of a person with a reasonable fear for his life. I am of the opinion that, in the circumstances, in light of all the information that the RPD had, including the explanations given by the appellant, its conclusion that the appellant failed to establish that he had a subjective fear of persecution is reasonable.\n[58] In short, after taking into account the appellant's testimony and the fact that at the time of some of the alleged facts he was a minor, the RPD provided ample justification for the various reasons why it came to the conclusion that the appellant was not credible.\n[59] For my part, after carefully reading the appellant's memorandum and the reasons for the RPD decision, I conclude that the RPD's decision based on the appellant's lack of credibility falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law, and the reasons for this decision are clear and sufficient.\nDid the RPD err in ignoring the documentary evidence in its analysis of an internal flight alternative?\n[60] Given my earlier conclusion, I consider that I do not have to answer this second question. Given that the appellant was found not to be credible, the RPD did not have to conduct an analysis of an internal flight alternative. Moreover, even if I came to the conclusion that it had erred in its analysis of an internal flight alternative, this could not change its decision to reject the appellant's claim for refugee protection because it did not err in finding that he was not credible.\nVII. REMEDY\n[61] For these reasons, I confirm the RPD's determination, namely, that XXXX XXXX is neither a \"Convention refugee\" under section 96 of the Act, nor a \"person in need of protection\" under section 97 of the Act.\n[62] The appeal is dismissed.\nAlain Bissonnette\nMe Alain Bissonnette\nSeptember 6, 2013\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n1.

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX (the Appellant), a citizen of China, appeals a determination by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD), denying his claim for refugee protection. The Appellant has submitted no new evidence in support of his claim. He has however requested an oral hearing. The Appellant further requests that the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) set aside the determination of the RPD and find that he is a Convention refugee. Alternatively he requests an oral hearing. In the further alternative, he requests that the matter be returned to the RPD for reconsideration by a differently-constituted panel.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] Pursuant to section 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), the RAD confirms the determination of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. The appeal is dismissed.\nBackground\n[3] The Appellant alleges he was introduced to Falun Gong by his father in XXXX 2012, and he practiced daily at home. In XXXX 2013 he joined his father's practice group.\n[4] The Appellant attended a summer camp in the United States (US) from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX, 2013.\n[5] His father was arrested by the Public Security Bureau (PSB) on XXXX XXXX, 2013 for distributing Falun Gong leaflets. The PSB came to the Appellant's home on XXXX XXXX, 2013, accused him of being a Falun Gong practitioner, and sought to arrest him.\n[6] The PSB provided the Appellant's family with a Notice of Arrest concerning the Appellant's father, dated XXXX XXXX, 2013. On XXXX XXXX, 2013, the PSB issued a summons for the Appellant's arrest.\n[7] The Appellant left China on XXXX XXXX, 2013 with the assistance of an agent. He used his own passport and a previously issued US visa. He arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2013, and made a claim for protection on October 17, 2013.\n[8] He continues to practice Falun Gong alone, and with others in Canada.\nRole of the RAD\n[9] While the IRPA sets out grounds for appeal as well as possible remedies, it does not specify the standard by which the RAD is to review the decision of the lower tribunal.\n[10] The RAD now has the benefit of Federal Court jurisprudence which speaks to the appellant tribunal's role in relation to that of the RPD.\n[11] In this regard, the Court in Huruglica considered the appropriate relationship between the RAD and the RPD.1 In Huruglica, the Court determined that the RAD is to conduct a \"hybrid appeal.\" It is to review all aspects of the RPD's decision and come to an independent assessment of the Appellant's refugee claim, deferring to the RPD only where the lower tribunal enjoys a particular advantage in reaching a conclusion. Where the RAD's assessment departs from that of the RPD, the RAD must substitute its own determination.\n[12] The Court determined that, in conducting its assessment, the RAD can recognize and respect the conclusion of the RPD on such issues as credibility and\/or where the RPD enjoys a particular advantage in reaching such a conclusion. The RAD is, however, not restricted as an appellate court is, to intervening on the facts only where there is \"palpable and overriding error.\"\n[13] The RAD will review all of the evidence in the RPD's record and come to its own independent assessment of whether the Appellant is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\nThe Issues\n[14] The panel indicated the determinative issue regarding this claim is credibility.\n[15] The Appellant submits the issues in regard to this appeal are the following:\n1. What is the applicable standard of review?\n2. Did the RPD Member err in his assessment of the Appellant's credibility?\nApplication for an Oral Hearing\n[16] The RAD notes that section 110(6) of IRPA states that the RAD may hold an oral hearing only if new evidence has been admitted. As no new evidence has been submitted, the RAD dismisses the application for an oral hearing.\nThe Panel's Findings\nJoining a practice group\n[17] The panel noted that the Appellant in his eligibility interview indicated that he became associated with or became a member of a Falun Gong organization as of XXXX 2013. The panel further noted the Appellant initially submitted in his Basis of Claim (BOC) narrative that he joined a Falun Gong practice group in January 2013. He subsequently amended his BOC and changed the date to April 2013. The panel questioned the Appellant concerning this inconsistency and he explained he had made a mistake and indicated the date he began practicing at home. The panel noted its concern that the Appellant did not provide a consistent date in regard to a significant event in his history.\nPrecautions\n[18] The panel asked the Appellant to list all of the precautions used by his practice group to avoid discovery. The Appellant testified that practitioners arrived and left the practice site separately, they kept music turned down, they closed doors and windows, and they met in two different locations. The panel noted that in spite being asked for a complete list several times, the Appellant failed to mention that the group used lookouts and that it had an escape plan. The Appellant explained that he did not remember everything.\n[19] The panel noted that precautions to avoid discovery by the PSB are serious matters, arguably entailing life and death implications. The panel drew a negative inference concerning the Appellant's failure to mention lookouts and the escape plan.\nNotice of Arrest\n[20] The panel noted that the Appellant testified the Notice of Arrest regarding his father's arrest was left by the PSB when they came to their home on XXXX 10, 2013. The panel further noted that the document indicated his father was detained in the \"Detention centre of XXXX XXXX\" without specifying an address. The panel further noted that XXXX XXXX had a population of XXXX million people and the Appellant testified he did not know if there was more than one detention centre.\n[21] The Appellant was asked how one would know where the detention centre was located without an address. The Appellant responded one could always check with the local PSB office. The Appellant further testified he knew where the facility was because his mother had gone to the local PSB office to ask.\n[22] The Appellant was further asked why the document referenced section 61 of the Criminal Procedure Law of China which refers to a completely different matter. The Appellant testified he had no knowledge of the law so he could not comment.\n[23] Counsel indicated in her submissions that section 61 of an earlier version of the Criminal Procedure law of China would have been a correct reference. Counsel submitted that the document in question may have simply been referencing an out of date statutory provision. The panel indicated it was prepared to concede this point but it noted that lack of an address in a city of 21 million people remained an \"insurmountable problem\". The panel concluded the Notice of Arrest was not a genuine document and drew an adverse inference in this regard.\nNotice of Summoning\n[24] The panel noted that the Notice of Summoning stated that the Appellant was summoned to report to \"the Criminal Investigation department of XXXX District,\" but as was the case with the Notice of Arrest, no specific address was given. The Appellant stated that all residents who live in XXXX XXXX XXXX would know where the local PSB office was located.\n[25] The panel showed the Appellant sample summonses in a Response to Information Request (RIR) in the RPD record, which noted \"there had been no change in the format since 2003,\" and further noted \"the forms are to be used throughout the country and there are to be no regional variations...\" The Appellant had no explanation. The panel concluded the Notice of Summoning was not a genuine document and drew an adverse inference in this regard.\nExit from China\n[26] The Appellant testified that the snakehead had bribed customs to allow him to exit China without problems. The panel asked the Appellant if the snakehead had bribed all the customs officers he might encounter and the Appellant responded he was not sure and he did not know.\n[27] The panel thought it more likely than not that the Appellant was required to deal with more than one official when exiting China by air and that he would not have had the privilege of choosing which official he dealt with. The panel found the Appellant was not believable in this regard and drew a negative inference.\nFalun Gong practice in Canada\n[28] The panel noted the Appellant testified he practiced alone at home and also with a practice group since his arrival in Canada. The Appellant also disclosed some corroborative letters\n[29] The panel noted that none of the authors of the letters were present in the hearing to respond to questions, and therefore the letters were only assigned very little weight.\n[30] The Appellant stated that the photographs he disclosed showed him practicing Falun Gong in XXXX XXXX. On closer examination, however, the Appellant conceded that only three of the photographs showed him practicing and the photographs were all taken on the same day.\n[31] The remaining photographs pictured him on his school trip to the US. The panel asked the Appellant why he had said all the pictures depicted Falun Gong practitioners and he responded that he thought the panel referred to those with Falun Gong exercises. The panel drew a negative inference from this exchange, and gave the three relevant photographs, all taken at the same place and time, very little weight.\nFalun Gong knowledge\n[32] The panel indicated the Appellant demonstrated a general knowledge of Falun Gong. The panel noted however, that the Appellant had difficulty provided substantive detail regarding the third exercise.\n[33] The panel noted the Appellant gave an incorrect answer when he was asked what Master Li suggested a practitioner should imagine himself to be when performing the exercise. The Appellant responded: a solid element meaning very calm and emptiness. The panel noted the correct answer was two empty barrels standing upright between heaven and earth. The Appellant then responded: \"Yes above the universe.\" The Appellant further responded the two barrels did not come across his mind immediately.\n[34] The panel noted the Appellant had testified he had studied Falun Gong and practiced daily alone and with a group since XXXX XXXX 2012, and it indicated it was troubled by the Appellant's inability to answer the question correctly.\nDemonstrations\n[35] The Appellant testified he was aware of rallies that took place on XXXX XXXX and sometime in XXXX, neither of which he attended. The Appellant further testified he was unaware of daily demonstrations outside the Chinese Consulate. The panel found that if the Appellant was engaged with the Falun Gong community in Toronto, \"as apparently he would have the panel believe,\" he should have been aware of these daily demonstrations. The panel drew a negative inference from the fact he was not aware of them.\n[36] The panel found, on the basis of the credibility concerns noted above, that the Appellant was not a credible and trustworthy witness. The panel further found, given the unreliability of the Appellant's evidence, that it was unable to find that the Appellant was or has been a Faun Gong practitioner of conviction, and that it did not believe the Appellant would attempt to practice Falun Gong if he were to return to China The panel found as well that the Appellant had not provided sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to allow a positive determination of his claim.\nThe Appellant's Submissions and the RAD's Analysis and Decisions\nStandard of Review\n[37] The Appellant submits the correctness standard applied to the issues set out in this appeal, and the appeal constitutes a de novo proceeding. The Appellant further submits that the RAD owes no deference to the RPD's credibility findings or treatment of evidence in this case.\n[38] The RAD disagrees with the Appellant that the appeal constitutes a de novo hearing and that the RAD owes no deference to the credibility findings of the RPD. The RAD is guided in this regard by the Federal Court decision in Huruglica, major aspects of which the RAD has reviewed in paragraphs 9 to 13, and adopts concerning the role of the RAD.\nCredibility\n[39] The Appellant submits the panel's credibility findings are unreasonable. The Appellant further submits the panel's findings often relied on speculation. The Appellant further submits the panel's reasons for its dismissal of documentary evidence he disclosed are without merit.\nDiscrepancy in Basis of claim form\n[40] The Appellant submits the discrepancy in the Appellant's evidence, where his BOC and eligibility interview indicated he joined his father's practice group in XXXX 2013, and his BOC amendment and testimony indicated he had in fact joined the practice group in XXXX 2013, is a minor discrepancy, addressed by the Appellant in his amendment.\n[41] The Appellant further submits that he provided a reasonable explanation that he failed to differentiate between the time he began practicing at home and the time he joined a group.\n[42] The Appellant states as well he had nothing to gain by amending the date, and the panel unreasonably and disproportionately seized upon this minor discrepancy.\n[43] The RAD notes while the panel indicated its concern, it made no finding in this regard.\nThe practice group's safety measures\n[44] The Appellant argues that his failure to mention lookouts and an escape plan does not mean he is not credible and that he is lying. The Appellant submits the panel unreasonably and microscopically examined the evidence.\n[45] The RAD disagrees with the Appellant that the panel's examination regarding this issue was unreasonable and microscopic. The RAD finds the use of lookouts is the most distinctive aspect of precautions used by Falun Gong groups and it was open to the RPD to draw a negative inference in this regard.\nNotice of Arrest\n[46] The Appellant submits the panel provided no evidentiary basis for finding the Notice of Arrest would contain an address of the detention facility.\n[47] The Appellant further submits it is plausible that the address of the detention facility would not have been included in the document and that the police would not want the family to know the precise location of the detention facility, and that the family would be expected to attend at a police station to make enquiries or apply for authorization to visit the detainee.\n[48] The RAD finds that while it may be reasonable to expect an address would be included in the document informing the family of an arrest, it agrees with the Appellant that the panel provided no evidentiary basis in this regard.\n[49] The RAD finds however that it disagrees with the panel's agreement that the reference to an incorrect article of the Criminal Procedure Law of China may have been due to the accidental referencing of an out of date statutory provision.\n[50] The RAD notes that the Criminal Procedure Law of China was amended in 2012, that the PSB is a national police force and it is reasonable to assume that a September 2013 document would contain the correct statutory reference.\n[51] The RAD finds the incorrect reference in a document issued by the PSB in a large metropolitan location like XXXX XXXX undermines the document's integrity.\nNotice of Summoning\n[52] The Appellant notes, in regard to the panel's finding that this document was fraudulent because it contained no address, that the sample used by the panel does not specify the address of the PSB office. The Appellant submits that if the sample summons lacks an address, it is unreasonable for the panel to draw a negative inference from the fact the Appellant's summons lacks an address.\n[53] The Appellant notes the panel stated that the format of his summons differs from the Board's sample copy but there did not appear to be any relevant difference between the two. The Appellant submits the panel failed to specify in what way the Appellant's sample has differed.\n[54] The RAD agrees with the Appellant that the lack of an address in the sample provided by the panel undermines its finding that the lack of an address is a basis for finding it to be fraudulent.\n[55] However, the RAD finds it was open to the panel to challenge the authenticity of the summons document on the basis of its format. Country document evidence2 indicates that a criminal summons must be printed on 260 mm high and 185 mm wide sheets of paper, with a top margin of 25 mm, a bottom margin of 20 mm, a left margin of 25 mm and a right margin of 15 mm with a 0.5 mm tolerance.\n[56] This document further indicates that the \"format and appearance of summonses should not differ according to the territorial jurisdiction of courts, procuracies and public security organs.\" The document also notes \"there are no jurisdictional differences in the format and appearances of summonses and subpoenas, with the exception of Hong Kong and Macau.\"\n[57] The RAD notes the height of the summons disclosed by the Appellant is 278 mm and not 260 mm. The width is 215 mm and not 185 mm, the left margin is 30 mm and not 25 mm, the right margin is 40 mm and not 15 mm, the bottom margin is 40 mm and not 20 mm, and the top margin is 25 mm as required.\n[58] The RAD finds it was open to the RPD to draw a negative inference and find the summons was not genuine.\nExit from China\n[59] The Appellant argues it is trite law that an implausibility finding must only be made in the clearest of cases. The Appellant cited as well Federal Court case law that held that the RPD must provide a \"reliable and verifiable evidentiary base against which the plausibility of the Applicants' evidence might be judged.\"\n[60] The Appellant submits the panel had no evidentiary basis for his implausibility finding that the Appellant would have gone through multiple officials in order to exit China, and that he would not be able to choose which official to deal with.\n[61] The Appellant cites the Federal Court's decision in Zhang in which the Court stated that it would not be implausible that a wanted person would be able to exit China with the help of a smuggler, and that it would only take a bribe to one person with access to the computer system.\n[62] The Appellant submits the panel's finding is unreasonable.\n[63] The RAD notes that the panel's finding is supported in country document evidence concerning the Golden Shield Project, an on-line system that monitors the movements and activities of Chinese citizens and contains information regarding people being pursued by the PSB. The RAD further notes the panel failed to provide this documentary evidence and a more substantive analysis in this regard. The RAD will do so.\n[64] The RAD notes the Appellant indicated in his BOC that the PSB came to his home on XXXX XXXX, 2013, accused him of being a Falun Gong practitioner, and sought to arrest him.\n[65] The RAD finds the Appellant's name would have been entered into the on-line system noted above on XXXX XXXX.\n[66] The RAD notes that the Appellant left China using his own passport and US visa and finds it is unlikely that he would have been able to pass through the multiple security checks in the airport without being stopped if his name had been entered into the Golden Shield Project.\n[67] The RAD finds that a snakehead might have been able to bribe one official but not all of those engaged in monitoring passengers. The RAD cites in this regard country document evidence3 which indicates there are separate barriers at airports that are designated for Chinese citizens, foreign travelers, and diplomatic staff and airline personnel. The Frontier Defense Inspection Bureau (FDIB) examines the passport and immigration and departures cards of Chinese travelers and verifies the identity of the person through a computerized records system. The same documentation indicates that Chinese citizens traveling overseas are required to show a valid passport, visa, and boarding pass and exit registration card. This documentation also indicates that all international airlines have to provide (accurate), (complete), and (timely), information on passengers including name, nationality, gender, date of birth, and passport number and expiration date.\n[68] The Appellant testified that a snakehead had bribed customs in order to allow him to exit China without problems. The panel found it more likely than not that the Appellant would have to deal with more than one official and he would not have had the privilege of choosing which official he dealt with.\n[69] The RAD finds it was open to the panel to make this finding in that the Appellant's documents and identity would have been noted when he checked in and received his boarding pass, and then further reviewed by the FDIB, and also reviewed by the security official checking identity information received from the airline.\n[70] The RAD acknowledges that documentary evidence indicates that there is corruption in China, reflected in this case in the bribery of officials. The RAD further finds however, that while a smuggler might be able to bribe one official and guide the Appellant to a particular checkpoint, it is unlikely that the smuggler would have contacts with all the officials, with access to the Golden Shield Project, at the various checkpoints in a major Chinese international airport.\n[71] The RAD is not persuaded that the case in the Zhang decision is comparable to the case at bar. The RAD notes the decision in Zhang was based on documentary evidence that existed in 2008 and made no reference to the Golden Shield Project. In the Zhang matter, the reviewing court made reference to a 2001 RIR, which addressed security and exit control procedures at Chinese airports. The documentary evidence cited above reflects the current fully implemented Golden Shield Project.\n[72] The RAD notes that the evidence in Zhang indicated that the claimant testified that she was told by the smuggler that her name was not put through the system. In the case at bar no such evidence was disclosed.\n[73] In addition, the RAD notes the Court in Zhang was responding to the RPD's conclusion \"that possibly hundreds of officials had to be bribed\" and found the Board had engaged in speculation. In the case at bar the panel makes no such speculative leap.\n[74] The RAD finds that the panel is entitled to make reasonable findings based on implausibilities, common sense and rationality, and may reject evidence if it is not consistent with the probabilities affecting the case as a whole.4 The RAD acknowledges that in such cases there must be a basis in the evidence to support such inferences. In this case, there is an evidential foundation for the panel's finding reflected in the documentary evidence cited by the RAD. The RAD concurs with the panel's finding that the Appellant was not believable in this regard.\nFalun Gong practice in Canada\n[75] The Appellant noted the panel gave little weight to the confirmation letters and photographs he disclosed. The Appellant further noted he was able to answer almost all the panel's questions concerning Falun Gong and that the panel seized upon one \"supposed discrepancy.\"\n[76] The Appellant noted that no evidence was cited indicating that the concept of imagining oneself as two empty barrels is a central concept of Falun Gong theory. The Appellant submits that this was a minor omission and treating it as determinative is capricious and perverse.\n[77] The Appellant further submits that the Federal Court has cautioned the Board against using religious knowledge trivia questions to assess the genuineness of a person's faith. The Appellant submits as well the Court has indicated there is a very low threshold establishing religious knowledge, and it was unreasonable of the panel to rely on the single 'incorrect' answer as a basis for dismissing all of the Appellant's Falun Gong evidence.\n[78] The RAD notes that Master Li's instructions to practitioners to imagine oneself to be two empty barrels may not be a central concept of Falun Gong theory, but finds that it is an instruction that someone who alleges he began Falun Gong practice in XXXX 2013 and continues to practice to the present day should have been aware of, since he would have regularly performed the third exercise.\n[79] The RAD further finds that the Appellant's inability to answer the question in regard to the third exercise is not a \"supposed discrepancy.\" It is a discrepancy and it was open to the panel to indicate it was \"troubled\" by the Appellant's inability to answer the question correctly.\n[80] The RAD notes as well that there is no evidence that the panel treated this matter as determinative, as it merely indicated it was troubled in this regard.\n[81] The RAD acknowledges that that the Federal Court has cautioned the Board concerning religious trivia questions to assess the genuineness of a person's faith. The RAD finds in this regard that Falun Gong is not a religion and having or not having knowledge regarding an instruction by Master Li is not a test of faith. It concerns rather having knowledge about an instruction that practitioners follow in their regular repetition of exercise three.\n[82] The RAD further finds that the question asked by the panel is not trivial as it reflects a practitioner's understanding of the link between one's body and the universe through which energy flows back and forth. This is a central aspect of Falun Gong practice.\n[83] The RAD finds as well there is no evidence that the panel relied on this one incorrect answer as a basis for dismissing all of the Appellant's Falun Gong evidence.\n[84] The RAD notes in this regard that the panel found, on the basis of the credibility concerns noted above, that the Appellant was not a credible and trustworthy witness. The RAD finds that the panel was referring to all of its credibility concerns and not merely to the one incorrect answer concerning Falun Gong knowledge.\n[85] In this regard the RAD cites the Federal Court decision in Jiang,5 in which the Court held that the Board must be entitled to import its credibility findings into its assessment of an applicant's sur place claim.\n[86] In regard to the Appellant's disclosure of confirmation letters and photographs concerning his Falun Gong practice in Canada, the RAD finds it was open to the panel to give little weight to the letters as the authors were not made available in the hearing to respond to questions. The RAD further finds these letters in themselves cannot confirm the genuineness of the Appellant practice.\n[87] In regard to the photographs, the RAD finds it was open to the panel to give little weight to photographs, all taken at the same time and place, as confirmation that the Appellant is a genuine Falun Gong practitioner.\n[88] The RAD finds, on the basis of its review and assessment of all the evidence in the RPD record that it was open to the panel to find that the Appellant had not provided sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to allow a positive determination of his claim. The RAD concurs in regard to this finding.\nDisposition\n[89] Pursuant to section 111 (1)(a) of IRPA, the RAD confirms the RPD's determination that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. The appeal is dismissed.\n(signed)\n\"Milton Israel\"\nMilton Israel\nDecember 24, 2014\nDate\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD.25.02 (June 23, 2014)\nRAD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SAR : TB4-08383\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] XXXX XXXX (the principal Appellant), his wife, XXXX XXXX and their minor child, XXXX XXXX, citizens of Syria, appeal a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) denying their claim for refugee protection. They have submitted new evidence in support of their appeal. The Appellants asks the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) to allow the appeal and find the Appellants to be Convention refugees or persons in need of protection. In the alternative, the Appellants ask that the RAD send the file back to the RPD for re-determination by a different panel. Failing either of these requested solutions, the Appellant requests that the RAD hold an oral hearing in accordance to \"Rule 66\" of the RAD Rules.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] Pursuant to section 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), the RAD confirms the decision of the RPD that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection. This appeal is dismissed.\nBackground\n[3] The Appellant alleged before the RPD that they face persecution in Syria due mainly to the Syrian civil war. Because the war has been ongoing since 2011, the Syrian government has resorted to calling up reservist troops to replace war casualties. The principal Appellant is a reservist and as such fears he will be called up or otherwise conscripted to fight in a war he does not believe in. The female Appellant fears the added violence against women which has been occurring in Syria since the outbreak of the civil war. Greater details of the claim may be read in the Appellant's Basis of Claim (BOC) form.1 Further, the Appellants also fear being returned to Syria as \"failed refugee claimants\" as such a designation will cause the Syrian government to persecute them.\n[4] The Appellant's application for refugee protection was heard on March 20, 2015. A negative decision was handed down on or about May 1, 2015. In that decision, the panel found that the Appellants lacked credibility and failed to produce sufficient evidence to substantiate their claims.\n[5] The Appellant submits that the RPD erred in both fact and in law and in mixed fact and law. The Appellant submits that the issues are as follows:\nA) What standard of review should the RAD adopt in the appeal?\nB) Did the panel commit an error in law by assessing the Appellants' credibility in the context of section 97 rather than under section 96?\nC) Did the panel err in its assessment of the Appellants' identities?\nD) Did the panel err in its credibility assessment?\nE) Did the panel err in its assessment of subjective fear?\nF) Did the panel err in its assessment of the objective country documentation in regard to the risk of being called to serve as a reservist in Syria?\nG) Did the panel err in its assessment under section 97, i.e. the Appellants' risk of being removed to Syria as failed asylum seekers?\nH) Did the panel breach procedural fairness by relying on extrinsic evidence without providing the Appellants the opportunity to make submissions on the relevance and probative value of the extrinsic evidence?\nI) Did the panel commit an error of law by rejecting the Appellants' section 97 claim, in part, for lack of subjective fear?2\nANALYSIS\nAdmissibility of Evidence Submitted on Appeal\n[6] Section 110(4) of the IRPA provides that the Appellant \"may present only evidence that arose after the rejection of their claim or that was not reasonably available, or that the person could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection.\"\n[7] Even where a document meets the test in section 110(4), this does not require the RAD to admit it into evidence without any further consideration. It is for the Appellant to make full and detailed submissions in his Memorandum about how any proposed new evidence meets the requirements of section 110(4) and how that evidence relates to the Appellant.3\n[8] The Appellants have disclosed two news articles4 printed from the internet after the date of the Decision being handed down. These articles speak to the civil war in Syria and as such are not \"new\" from that perspective. The first one also addresses the issue of Syrian men being conscripted and choosing to flee instead of facing that conscription. Even though this article was dated May 13, 2015, the information in it is not new. Forced recall of reservists is well documented in the National Documentation Packages.5 This article, in spite of its date provides no new evidence and as a result will not be allowed. The second article deals with the civil war and \"fresh opposition pledges to launch a drive to take the northern city of Aleppo.\" Although the specific rhetoric in this article may be new, the context of the article is not. It is simply re-iterating the words of men which have been spoken steadily over the last four years of civil war. This document does not add anything new to the Appellants' claim. The RAD rejects this article for these reasons.\n[9] The Appellants have submitted birth certificates of the three Appellants to show that they are all citizens of Syria. The Appellants argue that these documents were not reasonably available to them prior to the panel's decision due to the risk involved in obtaining documents from government authorities in Syria and having them sent to the Appellants in Canada. The RAD finds that this explanation makes no sense for the following reasons. Firstly, if it was too dangerous to obtain these documents prior to the decision being handed down, why is it not still too dangerous to do so? Secondly, why would the Appellants leave Syria without their birth certificates especially if they were planning to claim refugee status somewhere in the world? Thirdly, a birth certificate does not prove citizenship. A person may have received a birth certificate in his country of birth yet still could have given up his nationality or lost his nationality for a number of reasons.6 Birth certificates do not generally provide proof of citizenship in a case where a person has emigrated and obtained status in a second country. The birth certificates should reasonably have been available at the hearing or at least before the decision was handed down. They are not new in any sense of the Act (IRPA) and will not be allowed.\nRole of the RAD\n[10] Counsel has made some submissions in regard to the role that the RAD plays in the review of an RPD decision. The RAD finds that the recent Federal Court decision, in Huruglica,7 provides the RAD with guidance in relation to the appropriate standard that must be applied by a specialized tribunal such as the RAD to decisions of a first-level administrative tribunal. Justice Phelan states in paragraphs 54 and 55 of the foregoing decision:\n[54] Having concluded that the RAD erred in reviewing the RPD's decision on the standard of reasonableness, I have further concluded that for the reasons above, the RAD is required to conduct a hybrid appeal. It must review all aspects of the RPD's decision and come to an independent assessment of whether the claimant is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. Where its assessment departs from that of the RPD, the RAD must substitute its own decision.\n[55] In conducting its assessment, it can recognize and respect the conclusion of the RPD on such issues as credibility and\/or where the RPD enjoys a particular advantage in reaching such a conclusion but it is not restricted, as an appellate court is, to intervening on facts only where there is an \"overriding and palpable error.\"\n[11] Accordingly, the RAD will conduct its own assessment of the RPD's decision and come to an independent assessment of whether the Appellants are Convention refugees or a persons in need of protection. The RAD will recognize and respect the credibility findings of the RPD or other findings where the RPD has a particular advantage in reaching its conclusions. The RAD, however, will not be bound by those conclusions.\nThe RPD's Findings\n[12] The Appellant argues that the panel committed an error in law by assessing the Appellants' credibility in the context of the section 97 portion of their claim. In the Reasons and Decision, at paras. 39-70,8 the panel apparently finds that the Appellants' claim under section 97 fails due to the lack of credibility or trustworthiness of the Appellant. To quote the panel \"Because the claimant failed to produce their passports, I find the principal claimant not to be a credible or trustworthy witness, and their claims fail also under section 97 (1).\"9 This is problematic and is, in fact an error in law as argued by the Appellant. The RAD will do an independent analysis of the section 97 claim, later.\n[13] The Appellants argue that the panel erred in its assessment of the Appellants' identities. The Appellant argues that the panel's primary focus for credibility relates to the Appellants' destruction of their passports upon arrival in Canada. The panel concluded that this destruction foreclosed an avenue of enquiry in which the passports may have revealed information such as residency status in a third country (such as Brazil) which may have precluded the Appellants from the requirement of a Canadian Temporary Resident's Visa (TRV). The Appellants argue that the panel should have turned his mind to the other identity documents which were presented in evidence, to satisfy itself on the identity issue. The Appellants argue that there was an abundance of documentation, including very recent documentation from government sources10 such as the Syrian Ministry of the Interior which issued the Appellants' \"Family Book\" on XXXX XXXX 2013, a registration by that department into that book certifying the minor claimant's birth registration on XXXX XXXX 2014, a marriage contract book documenting the marriage of the two adult Appellants dated XXXX XXXX 2013 and many other documents dating back as far as 2002. The RAD agrees with the Appellants on this matter. The RAD finds that the abundance of documents presented at the hearing outweigh the loss of the passports in establishing identity. The RAD disagrees with the panel as to the value of the passports in establishing third country status, if those passports were Syrian and as the panel noted in his Reasons and Decision,11 Syrian Consular officials had confirmed that the child was the holder of a Syrian passport No. XXXX. Further, the Minister was satisfied that the Appellants travelled to Canada using Syrian passports. The RAD finds that the Appellants are Syrian citizens and on a balance of probabilities, they are not citizens of any other country nor do they enjoy substantially the same rights as citizens of any other country,\n[14] The Appellants argue that the panel erred in its credibility assessment and that that assessment is manifestly unreasonable. The Appellants argue that the panel fixated on the destruction of their passports upon arrival to Canada and from that, the panel, not liking the explanation given by the principal Appellant for destroying the passports, found the principal Appellant not to be a credible witness. The Appellant argues that this is the primary credibility finding in the entire decision which the panel then proceeds to extend to the entirety of the evidence and testimony. The Appellants argue that the destruction of the passports is a peripheral matter that has little, if any, bearing on their credibility. The Appellants cite numerous cases12 which speak to the destruction or loss of passports by refugee claimants as being peripheral to the claim. The RAD agrees with the Appellant. The destruction of the passports, although frustrating, is only peripheral to the claim and therefore the panel erred in assessing overall lack of credibility because of this issue.\n[15] The Appellant argues that the panel erred in its assessment of the Appellants' subjective fear. The Appellants failed to make a claim in Brazil. The Appellants explained that they feared the high crime rate in Brazil, that they did not understand Portuguese and that they were now what amounted to a destitute Muslim family of refugees living in a foreign country in which a language was spoken which they did not understand. The panel did not err in its assessment on this issue. Not only was the assessment based on the failure to claim in Brazil but also on the re-availment multiple times to Syria.\n[16] The RAD has perused the evidence and the Appellants' record. In the BOC, section 10(b) there is a line which reads \"If you do not understand English or French, we will provide an interpreter for you at your hearing.\" The Appellants have filled in this section requesting an Arabic interpreter. The RAD finds that this suggests that the issue of language being a barrier in Brazil is no different from the language barrier in Canada as an interpreter was required at the hearing and has been requested in the case of an oral hearing before the RAD. That removes one of the two main reasons given by the Appellants for not claiming in Brazil. The other was a perception of a high crime rate. The RAD discounts the reasons given by the Appellants at the hearing as well as those outlined in the Memorandum as insufficient to justify not seeking refugee protection in Brazil if the Appellants were truly fearful of the issues stated as the reason for leaving Syria.\n[17] Further, the Appellants do not reasonably address the serious issue of re-availment in regards to the subjective fear assessment. The RAD finds that it is highly implausible that persons fearing for their lives as the Appellants say they did when they fled to Brazil, would then re-avail themselves, not once, but at least twice after getting to relative safety, to the country where they claim to fear this persecution. The RAD quotes the Appellants' counsel13 as saying,\n\"Soon after the birth of their child, XXXX XXXX, on XXXX XXXX 2014, the Appellants sought ways to leave Syria and seek asylum elsewhere. ...At the end of XXXX 2014, all three of the Appellants flew to Malaysia, where they applied for visitor visas for Canada and Brazil, in order to seek asylum.\n[18] It is obvious to the RAD that the Appellants (through their counsel) are claiming that they intended to seek asylum in Brazil (or Canada if they obtained visas) yet upon arriving in Brazil they failed to make a claim and continued that failure during the few days they remained there before returning to Syria, the very place they claim to have fled out of fear for their lives. The RAD finds it improbable that if the Appellants were so fearful of Syria, that they would return after only a few days away and then the principal Appellant would chose to leave his wife and infant child in this dangerous country while he returned to Brazil to look for a dwelling for the family. This makes no sense to the RAD. A reasonable person would have remained in Brazil, found a home and moved the family into it rather than fly half way around the world to a place where they feared persecution and even death to wait while one returned to Brazil to look for a house. Then, on XXXX XXXX, 2014, the principal Appellant (after having re-availed himself on XXXX XXXX for a second time) took his family back to Brazil where again they failed to claim protection upon arrival and continued that failure to apply until they left Brazil on or about the XXXX of XXXX 2014, for Toronto. The RAD finds that this behaviour belies any notion of subjective fear on the Appellants behalf. The RAD finds that the panel did not err in its assessment of subjective fear. The RAD agrees with the panel on this issue.\n[19] The Appellants argue that the panel erred in its assessment of the objective country documentation in regard to the risk of being called to serve as a reservist in Syria. The principal Appellant has provided evidence14 that he had completed his mandatory military service and had been signed into the reserves. The panel had written15 that the documentary evidence regarding military service is not entirely clear regarding Syria calling up its reserves and cites the NDP, item 8.2 in this regard. The Appellants argue that the panel's assessment of the evidence displays a clear error of fact as the Appellant has the most recent up to date country condition documents16 which clearly show that the government in Syria has stepped up activation of reserves, by the tens of thousands. The Appellants argue that given the panel made no reference to any of this evidence which contradicts the panel's findings, it is argued that it should be inferred that the panel either ignored or overlooked that evidence. The RAD agrees with the Appellant in this case. There is ample evidence in record which speaks to the calling up of the reserve in Syria. This is material to the basis of the claim and should not have been ignored or overlooked. The RAD finds that in this case, the panel erred in its assessment of the situation for reservists in Syria.\n[20] The Appellant argues that the panel erred in its assessment of the claim under section 97 in regards to the Appellants' risk of being removed to Syria as failed asylum seekers. The Appellants had submitted that, as they do not possess travel documents and their claim is denied, their removal from Canada will require the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) to obtain travel documents from the Syrian authorities to effect removal which would undoubtedly alert Syrian authorities to the possibility that the Appellants had made a refugee claim in Canada.\n[21] The RAD has perused the documents in evidence and refers to the following excerpt:17\n\"According to information available to the UNHCR Representation in Damascus, and confirmed by a number of European Embassies in Syria, the mere unsuccessful application for asylum abroad will not lead per se to prosecution or other forms of persecution in Syria.\n1. However, persons who left Syria illegally may have to face prosecution because of illegal departure and this is in many cases most probable.\nThe Syrian authorities have indicated to different embassies that the mere illegal departure is not considered as a serious crime. This does not apply if there should be any person who is suspected on matters related to terrorism. The same is the case if there is any indication that the person was involved in trafficking activities.\n2. Persons who have engaged abroad in political activities (e.g. demonstrations in front of Syrian Embassies against the Syrian Government) may indeed have to face prosecution upon return.\n... .\n4. The procedure upon return of the unsuccessful asylum-seeker to Syria is the following:\na. The person has to report to the Immigration Department in order to apply for new documentation.\nb. The procedure also comprises a visit to the Political Security Branch by which the person will be interrogated regarding the earlier motives and reasons for the illegal departure from Syria. Should this arise, it will be very difficult for the returnee to keep the information on a potential asylum application abroad confidential. Inquiries on the reasons for an asylum application abroad may follow.\nc. Should there be no problem, then the person will obtain, in about three months, new identity documents.\nd. Should the authorities come to the conclusion that the person may be considered as an opponent against the regime, the consequences may be very serious. UNHCR is not aware of the fate of such persons. Human Rights Reports on the conditions and treatment of detainees in different types of detention facilities, in particular of those facilities belonging to different Security Branches, speak for themselves.\n[22] The RAD finds that the evidence is that the failed asylum seekers, so long as they departed Syria legally, which these Appellants apparently did, have nothing to fear in this regard upon their return. Therefore, the RAD finds that although the panel's reasoning may have been flawed, the end result remains the same and that is that the Appellants, on a balance of probabilities will not face persecution as failed refugee claimants upon their return to Syria. The section 97 analysis includes the issue of the calling up of reserves. As there are tens of thousands of reservists being called up to war, this becomes a generalized risk and one not specific to the Appellants. Section 97(1) of the Act reads as follows:\n97. (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality, or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally [emphasis added]\na) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, or torture, within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention against Torture; or\nb) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual punishment if\n...\nii)the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country [emphasis added].\"\n[23] The RAD finds that the risk faced by the Appellants is not one of a personal nature (generalized) and the RAD finds that the risk faced is generally faced by a great many others throughout the country. For these reasons, the Appellants claim fails under section 97 of the Act.\n[24] The Appellants argue that the panel breached the duty of procedural fairness by relying on extrinsic evidence without allowing the Appellants an opportunity to make submissions on that evidence. The evidence in question is referred to by the panel18 in regards to pre-removal risk assessments. The panel makes conclusions based on misapprehensions of the documents in question and then finds that the Appellants are not likely to be removed from Canada to Syria in any case, based on the misapprehension of those documents. The RAD agrees with the Appellant in this matter with the exception that the RAD does not find it to be a material breach. That is the assessment based on these documents was in fact flawed however the RAD had disregarded that assessment entirely and has re-assessed the section 97 claim on its own merit with disregard for such issues not relevant to its decision, including Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) which is outside the purview of this Tribunal. The RAD finds that the panel did err in its assessment of the PRRA however that assessment was not material to the claim and will not affect the outcome of this appeal.\nDisposition\n[25] The RAD has found that the RPD did commit some reviewable errors and the RAD has reviewed those errors. The RAD has re-assessed the claim and has found that, in regards to subjective fear, the RAD finds that the Appellants have failed to convince the RAD of their subjective fear based on the reasons above, If there is no subjective fear, then the section 96 claim must fail and so it does. The RAD, having assessed the section 97 portion of this claim finds that it too fails as there is no personalized risk to these Appellants and the risk that they may in fact face is a risk shared by a large percentage of the population.\nCONCLUSION\n[26] Pursuant to section 111(1)(a) of the IRPA, the RAD confirms the decision of the RPD that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (Principal Appellant) is a citizen of Mexico. His children, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX (Minor Appellants) are citizens of the United States (U.S.). The Appellants appealed a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) dated March 25, 2020, rejecting their claims. The Appellants allege that the face a serious possibility of persecution in Mexico because they are perceived to be foreigners. They also allege that they face persecution on the basis of the Principal Appellant's role as a pastor. The RPD found that the Appellants allegations were credible, however, it noted that the Minor Appellants did not advance a claim against the U.S. The RPD also concluded that the Principal Appellant had a viable Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) in Merida and rejected the claims.\n[2] For the reasons that follow, I find that the Principal Appellant does not have a viable IFA and substitute a determination that he is a Convention refugee. However, I agree with the RPD that the Minor Appellants have not advanced any allegations of risk against their country of citizenship and reject their appeals.\nBACKGROUND\n[3] The Principal Appellant moved to the U.S. as a child and lived there for most of his life. The Minor Appellants were born in the U.S. and hold citizenship on that basis. The Appellants moved from the U.S. to Mexico for the Principal Appellant to work as a pastor. Upon returning to Mexico, the Appellants were victims of threats and crimes. They allege that the police were unable or unwilling to help them. The Appellants allege that they were targeted as they are perceived as outsiders. They also allege that the Principal Appellant was targeted because he is a pastor. The Minor Appellants returned to the U.S. with their mother. Their mother claimed asylum in the U.S. but was detained and then deported. During this time, the Principal Appellant remained in Mexico where he alleges, he was threatened and followed by cartel members. Fearing for their safety, the Appellants decided to travel to Canada and made refugee claims.\nROLE OF THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION\n[4] The Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) reviews decisions of the RPD on a standard of correctness after conducting an independent assessment of the evidence before it. The exception to this rule is where the RPD enjoys a meaningful advantage in the assessment and weighing of oral testimony heard, which, in particular cases, attracts deference. Unless specifically stated below, I have applied a correctness standard.1\nANALYSIS\nAppellants' arguments\n[5] The Appellants argue that the RPD erred in its assessment of their forward-looking risk. They argue that the RPD failed to adequately consider the evidence about the targeting of priests and pastors by the cartels in Mexico. They argue that their new evidence also highlights this targeting is on-going. They also argue that the RPD failed to adequately consider that the perception that they are foreigners would heighten their risk. The Appellants argue that the RPD underestimated the prevalence of crime in Merida in its IFA analysis. Finally, the Appellants also argue that it would be unreasonable for them to relocate in their circumstances.\nNew evidence\n[6] Section 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)2 sets out that an Appellant may only present evidence that arose after the rejection of their claim, or that was not reasonably available, or that they could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented at the time of the rejection. Where evidence meets the requirements of section 110(4), the RAD will then go on to consider the factors affirmed by the Federal Court of Appeal in Singh.3\n[7] The Appellants submit the following documents as new evidence with their appeal:\n1. A letter from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, confirming the Principal Appellant's employment dated XXXX XXXX, 2020;4\n2. CSW reported titled \"A culture of impunity, religious discrimination in Mexico\" dated April 2020. 5\n3. Letter from the pastor of a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in Chiapas, Mexico, dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2020.6\n4. Article titled \"A dangerous family member of the Beltr\u00e1n Leyva Cartel detained in Merida dated April 5, 2020.7\n5. XXXX XXXX XXXX assessment for the Minor Appellants XXXX XXXX, 2020.8\n[8] I find that items 1-4 meet the requirements for new evidence and will be accepted with the appeal. These items contain information that post-dates the rejection of the Appellants' claims. The information is new, and as these documents reflect ongoing conditions in Mexico and the Principal Appellant's employment, they would be relevant to this appeal. I have no concerns with the credibility of these items; therefore, they will be admitted.\n[9] I find that the assessment of the Minor Appellants (item 5) does not meet the requirements of new evidence. While the report itself post-dates the rejection of the Appellants' claims, the information contained in the report does not pertain to anything that post-dates the rejection of the claims. There is no indication that the Appellants were unable to secure this assessment prior to their claims being rejected. In fact, I note that they presented a similar assessment to the RPD which forms part of the record. Given that they argue that this assessment is relevant to their ability to relocate in Mexico, they could have been expected to procure and produce such an assessment before their claims were rejected. Therefore, the report does not meet the statutory requirements of new evidence and is rejected.\nThe RAD will not hold an oral hearing.\n[10] While I have accepted new evidence with the appeal, I find that this evidence does not raise a serious issue with respect to the Appellants' credibility. Therefore, the conditions for an oral hearing, pursuant to subsection 110(6) of the IRPA, are not met and a hearing will not be held.\nThe Minor Male Appellants do not advance an allegation of risk against the United States and therefore their appeals are denied.\n[11] The RPD asked the Appellants' counsel if they were advancing a claim for the Minor Appellants, who are American citizen against the United States. Counsel advised the RPD that they were not advancing a claim against the United States, and therefore the RPD rejected their claims on the basis that no allegations of risk were made against this country of citizenship. The Principal Appellant included the Minor Appellants on his Notice of Appeal but present no arguments against the RPD's finding and make no allegations of risk in the United States. As such, I agree with the RPD and reject the appeals of the Minor Appellants.\nThe claim of the Principal Appellant\nThe determinative issue is the Principal Appellant's forward-looking risk as a pastor preaching against the use of drugs.\n[12] The RPD accepted that the Appellants' allegations were credible. After reviewing the record, I agree with the RPD. The Principal Appellant's testimony was consistent with the evidence and I accept the allegations occurred as alleged.\n[13] The RPD found that the Principal Appellant did not receive and specific threats from any specific cartel. The RPD noted that the objective evidence did indicate that religious leaders in Mexico had been victims of crime. However, the RPD found that the objective evidence did not indicate any incidents of violence against religious leaders in Merida. The RPD also noted that Merida was in one of the safest parts of Mexico. As such, the RPD found that the Principal Appellant could safely relocate to Merida and would not face a serious possibility of persecution.\n[14] The Appellants argue that they will stick out anywhere in Mexico and be perceived as foreigners. They argue that this will increase the risk that they would be targeted for kidnapping. They highlight that the objective evidence, including their new evidence, highlights that religious leaders are perceived to be a threat to cartels and are targeted because of this.\n[15] After an independent review of the record, I find that the Principal Appellant faces a serious possibility of persecution as a pastor.\n[16] The test for assessing an IFA is two-pronged and is set out in the Federal Court of Appeal's decision in Rasaratnam:9\n(1) The Board must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an IFA exists and\/or the claimant would not be personally subject to a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture in the IFA.\n(2) Moreover, the conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claim, for him to seek refuge there.\nBoth prongs must be satisfied to find that the Appellants have an IFA. Once the issue of IFA has been raised and the potential IFAs have been identified, the burden of proof rests with the Appellants to show that they do not have an IFA. An IFA must be a realistic and attainable option.10\n[17] While I agree with the RPD that the Principal Appellant has not established that the individuals who threatened and followed him could locate him in Merida, I find that he would still face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Mexico on the basis of his profile as a pastor.\n[18] The objective evidence reveals that religious leaders have been targeted by the cartel and have been subjected to extortion, threats, intimidation, violence, kidnappings and even murder.11 The International Freedom report from the United States Department of State indicates that NGOs believe that priests and other religious leaders are targeted as they are seen as moral authority figures in their communities.12 The report from the CSW submitted by the Appellants as new evidence highlights that criminal groups often demand total co-operation from the local populations and may view religious institutions and leaders as competition in achieving this loyalty. The report also notes that religious leaders who refuse to co-operate often face severe consequences and notes that 80% of the cases involving murders or disappearances of priests remain unsolved.13\n[19] The letter from the Pastor from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX church in Mexico also supports the Appellants' allegations that religious leaders are targeted throughout Mexico. This letter indicates that pastors of the church have been targeted for extortion and some have been kidnapped throughout Mexico, including in the state of Yucatan.14\n[20] The Principal Appellant has credibly established not only that he continues to be a pastor, but that he openly preached about the dangers of substance abuse. The Principal Appellant's evidence was that he has steadfastly called for young people to avoid drugs and criminal elements. The Principal Appellant has demonstrated his commitment to this work, continuing to work as an assistant pastor since coming to Canada. As such, I find that he would likely continue in this role and publicly express these views. I find that this would increase his risk as his views would be understood as a challenge to the business of the cartels. I also note that the Principal Appellant also credibly established that he has already received threats against him and his family and has been followed on the basis of his role as a pastor. As such, I find that he faces a serious possibility of persecution throughout Mexico.\n[21] As I find that the IFA fails on the first prong, I will not go on to consider the second prong.\nState Protection\n[22] While the RPD did not make a determination on state protection, I am able to do so on the basis of the record before me. The objective evidence establishes that despite some efforts by the state to combat crime, the police are generally ineffective and often tainted by corruption.15 The objective evidence also sets out that due to this corruption, law enforcement in Mexico has assisted criminals and the cartels and engaged in human rights violations.16 As previously noted, law enforcement has been extremely ineffective in solving the cases of murder or missing religious leaders, with over 80% of these cases remaining unsolved. I also note that the Principal Appellant attempted to approach the police for protection in Mexico, but they were unable to assist him. Therefore, I find that he does not have access to adequate state protection.\nCONCLUSION\n[23] The appeal is allowed. I substitute my own decision that the Principal Appellant is a Convention refugee. However, I dismiss the appeals and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Minor Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n(signed)\nJ. Louren\u00e7o\nJ.

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] XXXX XXXX, the principal appellant, and XXXX XXXX, the associate appellant, are from Haiti. The appellants are appealing the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rendered on December 31, 2019, rejecting their refugee protection claims.\n[2] The principal appellant alleges that he fears for his life by reason of his political involvement in the RDNP party, as well as the use of his residence for meetings of party members by his brother-in-law, who, a party member also, was murdered on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2011. On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2011, the appellants' residence was attacked by armed individuals who were looking for the appellant. The appellant left Haiti for the United States on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2011, and the associate appellant followed him on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2011. They arrived in Canada to claim refugee protection here in XXXX 2017.\n[3] The RPD determined that the appellant was not credible as to his political involvement. The determinative issues were therefore that of credibility and the prospective risk. They are still the same before the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD).\nDETERMINATION\n[4] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD reasonably determined that the appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nROLE OF THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION\n[5] I will review the RPD decision by applying the correctness standard of review after conducting an independent analysis of all the evidence before me, including the recording of the hearing.1\nANALYSIS\n[6] The RPD considered the following allegations made by the appellants to be credible: (i) the appellants allowed the brother-in-law to use their residence for political meetings; (ii) the appellant's brother-in-law was murdered on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2011; (iii) armed individuals attacked their home on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2011, searching for the appellant, who escaped through the back door.2\n[7] Nevertheless, the RPD did not believe that the appellant was himself an RDNP party activist or involved in any way in politics, considering his lack of knowledge about the Haitian political system.3 In sum, the appellant testified that he was already in the United States during the election and that he learned of Martelly's accession to the presidency on the news, whereas he was still in Haiti at the time.4 The RPD considered that it was reasonable to expect that the appellant, as a political activist, remembers that he was in Haiti during Martelly's election as president in March 2011.5 The RPD therefore concluded that the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2011, attack was motivated by the permission he gave his brother-in-law to use his residence to hold RDNP meetings.6 Therefore, given the passage of time, the RPD considered that the serious possibility of another attack against the appellants had not been established due to the agents of persecution's lack of motivation, if they were to return to Haiti.\n[8] The appellants submit that the RPD breached the principle of natural justice and procedural fairness by failing to analyze the associate appellant's refugee protection claim.7 Moreover, according to the appellants, the RPD breached these principles by failing to conduct an analysis of the allegations under paragraph 97(1)(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).8\n[9] I note that the associate appellant's refugee protection claim is based on that of her spouse. In particular, she did not submit a different written account and did not raise individual and specific allegations. I note that the appellants did not identify which part of the associate appellant's testimony the RPD did not consider while assessing the credibility of their refugee protection claims and that would have had an impact on the outcome of the credibility assessment of the allegations. After listening to the recording of the hearing, I am of the view that the RPD questioned both appellants appropriately with respect to the central allegations of their claim and I consider that, although the RPD did not specifically discuss the associate appellant's testimony, the presumption that the decision-maker reviewed all the evidence applies in this case.9 I therefore reject this argument of the appellants.\n[10] With respect to the application of paragraph 97(1)(b) of the IRPA, I note that the appellants have made the same allegations in support of both sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA. It is clear that if the appellants failed to establish a serious possibility of persecution that meets the legal test of section 96 of the IRPA, the same factual allegations will not establish a risk as defined by section 97 of the IRPA, which requires a higher legal test to establish the existence of a danger or risk to life on a balance of probabilities. The appellants did not articulate how the allegations that the RPD considered credible meet the legal test of paragraph 97(1)(b) of the IRPA. I therefore reject these arguments on appeal.\nErrors alleged in the assessment of the appellants' credibility\n[11] The RPD considered that the male appellant had testified credibly with respect to certain allegations, but some credibility issues arose with respect to other aspects of these allegations, including his involvement in politics.\n[12] The appellants submit that this analysis is incorrect, as it makes a [translation] \"hybrid\" assessment of the credibility that is declared credible for this allegation, and not credible for others. According to them, this represents a flawed assessment because it was not conducted in clear and explicit terms. Furthermore, the appellants submit that although political activism is not established, the fact that they allowed the use of their residence for party meetings projected an imputed political opinion onto them.10 They also complain that the analysis was carried out on peripheral elements of the refugee protection claim and that the assessment was superficial.11\n[13] I agree with the appellants that allowing the use of their residence for political meetings was sufficient for the agents of persecution to perceive them as party members, and thus to impute a political opinion to them.12 Also, the RPD came to the conclusion that the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2011, attack resulted from this imputed political opinion. Moreover, I note that based on his testimony, the appellant's involvement was relatively minor in that it was limited to motivating people to attend meetings and vote for the RDNP party from XXXX 2010 to XXXX 2011. 13 He also testified that he was not yet a member of the party at the time of the events. 14 I am therefore of the view that the RPD erred in failing to consider that the appellants may have been imputed a political opinion, whether or not the appellant was an activist. I will assess the impact of this error in the remainder of my analysis.\nProspective risk of persecution\n[14] The RPD concluded that given the passage of time and the fact that the appellant did not establish on a balance of probabilities that he himself was involved in politics, a serious possibility that the appellants would be attacked again if they returned to Haiti was not established.\n[15] The appellants submit that the passage of time does not negate the persecution suffered and is not a relevant element of sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA.15 They repeat that their son was met by two men who allegedly told him that he looked like the appellant, which makes revenge against the appellants likely.16\n[16] Given that I consider that the appellants were targeted by agents of persecution during the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2011, attack on the basis of their imputed political opinion, I will conduct my independent analysis of all the evidence to assess the proof of prospective risk of persecution in light of all the evidence.\n[17] The only evidence filed by the appellants concerns a recent incident during which their son was allegedly recognized by some people on a bus as looking like XXXX son. He stated that he was afraid but does not know if these individuals were armed or were associated in any way to a political group. Also, the appellant testified that he did not perceive this incident as a threat.17 Like the RPD, I consider that this evidence is insufficient to demonstrate that the appellants are still wanted by the political opponents.\n[18] The associate appellant mentioned during her testimony that she fears that the agents of persecution [translation] \"never forget.\"18 This statement is echoed in the National Documentation Package (NDP) on Haiti, which indicates the culture of revenge that is rampant in Haiti, as noted by the RPD in paragraph 22 of the decision. However, this document indicates that in cases of serious political revenge, family members are also targeted. Yet, as mentioned by the RPD, I note that no member of the appellants' respective families has been targeted by the agents of persecution since they left Haiti.19 Moreover, the objective documentary evidence in the NDP indicates that the RDNP members are not subject to significant retribution under the current government.20\n[19] Therefore, I am of the opinion that, despite the errors previously noted, the RPD correctly concluded that the appellants did not establish that there was a serious possibility that they would be reattacked by the agents of persecution, if they were to return to their country of origin.\nSubjective fear and absence of asylum application in the United States\n[20] The RPD concluded that the failure to apply for asylum in the United States constituted behaviour inconsistent with that of a person who fears for their life, and therefore, that the appellants had exaggerated the risks they would face in Haiti.21\n[21] The appellants submit that their delay in applying for asylum was because they had temporary status as a result of the earthquake.22 In addition, their subjective fear is supported by the fact that they have never returned to Haiti since they left.23\n[22] I do not agree with the RPD that their failure to apply for asylum in the United States within one year of their arrival means that the appellants were not, at that time, experiencing a subjective fear of returning to Haiti. The events of XXXX XXXX XXXX 2011, obviously frightened the appellants, who subsequently left the country within a short period of time.\n[23] Conversely, and as discussed above, the appellants did not establish a serious possibility that they would be subjected to another attack should they return to their home country as of today. I also note that their current subjective fear is not supported by the objective evidence. When questioned about his fear should he return to Haiti, the appellant testified that [translation] \"anything can happen,\" and the associate appellant explained that she feared returning because \"insecurity is everywhere in Haiti.\"24 Therefore, I am of the opinion that their current subjective fear is based more on the generalized violence that is currently prevalent in Haiti. The appellants did not establish how this generalized violence would increase the risk of more than a mere possibility that they would be subjected to persecution within the meaning of the Convention, should they return to Haiti.\n[24] Under subparagraph 97(1)(b)(ii) of the IRPA, generalized violence is not an element that results in protection. Since the appellants did not identify any particular group or individual who may pose a risk to them as defined in this section.\n[25] I am therefore of the opinion that the appellants did not successfully establish that they would face a serious possibility of persecution or that, on a balance of probabilities, they would be personally subjected to a risk to their lives or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, within the meaning of paragraph 97(1)(b) of the IRPA, if they returned to Haiti.\nCONCLUSION\n[26] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the RPD's determination, namely that the appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n(signed)\nMe Martine Durocher\nMe Martine Durocher\nJanuary 28, 2021\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD File No. \/ No de dossier de la SAR : MC0-02962\nMC0-02963\nRAD.25.02 (January 14, 2020)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n2\nImmigration and Refugee\nBoard of Canada\nRefugee Appeal Division\nCommission de l'immigration et du\net du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 du Canada\nSection d'appel des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s\nRAD.25.02 (January 14, 2020)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (Appellant), a citizen of Honduras, appealed a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD), dated June 27, 2018, rejecting his claim for refugee protection. The Appellant fled and left Honduras for the United States at the age of 14. He did not claim asylum in the United States because he feared he would be deported. The Appellant came to Canada in XXXX 2014 and subsequently claimed asylum in Canada in 2017. The Appellant fears that he will be harmed by criminal elements in Honduras if he returns to that country. He submits that he will be at particular risk of harm because he left Honduras at a young age and has lived his entire adult life abroad, therefore he does not look or speak like other Hondurans. He also submits that he will be targeted and face an increased risk as a deportee.\n[2] The RPD found that:\n* The Appellant is personally not at risk should he return to Honduras;\n* The Appellant's account of what happened to his brother after he was deported from Canada and to his father was not credible; and,\n* The Appellant would not be targeted by criminals as a returnee.\n[3] Considering all the evidence in the case, including new evidence that was not available to the RPD, I find that Appellant is a person in need of protection.\nOVERVIEW OF APPEAL\n[4] The Appellant argues on appeal that:\n* The RPD erred in its assessment of the Appellant's credibility and further erred in its assessment of the future risk the Appellant faces if he returns to Honduras;\n* The RPD's assessment of the Appellant's credibility failed to take into account the totality of the evidence;\n* The RPD failed to take into consideration the factors in the IRB's Assessment of Credibility paper, namely the Appellant's nervousness in testifying, his psychological condition, young age, cognitive difficulties, the passage of time, educational background and socio-economic background; and,\n* The RPD failed to carry out a proper risk assessment pursuant to section 97. It ignored evidence contradicting its finding. This is an error.\nPersonal risk profile is the determinative issue\n[5] I find that the personal risk profile of the Appellant is the determinative issue in making a determination pursuant to section 97.\nROLE OF THE RAD\n[6] When reviewing the RPD decision, I am required to independently determine whether the RPD was correct in relation to each alleged error of law, fact or mixed fact and law. I may defer to the RPD's credibility assessment of oral testimony, if I find that the RPD had a meaningful advantage in the circumstances.1 Reasons will be provided in my analysis if I find that the RPD had a meaningful advantage\nANALYSIS\nNo nexus to Convention2 grounds therefore analysed as section 97\n[7] The RPD found that the Appellant has not presented credible evidence to establish a nexus to a Convention ground, therefore the RPD evaluated the claim under section 97. The Appellant did not contest this finding. I agree with the RPD and find there is no nexus to Convention grounds.\n[8] The RPD concluded that\n. . . the objective evidence does not establish that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant would be personally subject to the harm feared when this evidence is viewed in conatact (sic) and when the volume of returnees to Honduras is considered.3\n[9] The Research Directorate of the IRB provided additional evidence to the RAD regarding the possible harm that deporteees face in Honduras. This evidence was disclosed to the Appellant and forms part of of the RAD record. This evidence was not before the RPD.\n[10] The evidence provided by the Research Directorate included a study by Public Safety Canada found that \"Deportees face a particularly high level of danger in the days and weeks after their return, when they are vulnerable, and may lack money and support networks in Honduras.\"4\n[11] The Public Safety Canada Study concluded that:\nReview deportation to Honduras\nCanada has a policy of not forcibly returning individuals to countries where their lives could be at risk due to conflict, insecurity or persecution. In cases where the risks are deemed to be too great, Canada can issue a Temporary Suspension of Removals (TSR). A TSR would not apply to those who have been convicted of a crime. TSRs have been issued in the past when conditions on the ground seriously jeopardized the safety of deportees due to political unrest (for instance, in Haiti in 2004), natural disasters (Haiti in 2010) or general insecurity. The difficult conditions facing Honduran deportees are well documented in this report. Poor economic conditions, social exclusion and lack of access to healthcare, shelter and medical assistance are not sufficient to justify a TSR. By contrast, forced gang recruitment, intimidation, abuse and murder could justify theimplementation of a TSR. In light of the documented murder of at least 35 deportees from the U.S. upon their return to Honduras, it would be reasonable to conduct additional research into the conditions facing Canadian deportees returning to Honduras, paying particular attention to threats to their personal security.5\n[12] While the broader policy issue surrounding deportations to Honduras is not at issue here, the Public Safety analysis of a case for considering a general Temporary Suspension of Removals (TSR) provides credible evidence of an elevated risk profile for deportees to Honduras.\n[13]\nThe IRB's Honduras Information Gathering Mission Report states:\n. . . the mission learned that there are a significant number of cases where returnees were killed shortly after they returned to Honduras. According to PMH, there are cases of people who left Honduras, due to gang or organized crime-related violence, who were killed shortly after returning to San Pedro Sula. PMH indicated that some press reports attribute these crimes to theft or robbery, even though, in many cases, deportees arrive without any belongings.6\n[14] The RPD cites evidence from the report of the special rapporteur that returnees have been killed upon arrival in Honduras, however, the RPD concludes that the balance of probabilites does not indicate that the Appellant would be personally subject to harm given the volume of returnees.7 I am required to re-weigh the evidence taking into account all available evidence, including evidence that was not before the RPD.\n[15] The RPD did not have any issues with the Appellant's identity and his profile as a young male from Honduras who left his country of origin in 2005 at the age of 14 and that he has resided in the United States or Canada since leaving Honduras. He has testified that he does not look or talk like a Honduran and that he would be targeted. Based on my assessment of the evidence, I also accept the Appellant's profile as described above.\nThe appellant's personal circumstancces place him at particular risk of harm\n[16] A person applying for protection under section 97(1) must demonstrate not only a likelihood of a personal risk but also that the risk is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country.\n[17] The Appellant has established that he left Honduras as a minor and that he has lived in the United States or Canada since that time. He has testified that he does not speak like a Honduran or appear to be a native Honduran and that he would be readily discernible in Honduras as someone from abroad. While these characteristics are not innate per se, the Appellant is not able to alter them in the short term. He testified that he would be perceived as having money or access to money although he as neither. He lacks the survival skills and contacts that a native Honduran would normally rely upon to mitigate risk of harm in Honduras.\n[18] Honduras suffers from exceptionally high levels of criminality and corruption. All Hondurans face a risk of being vitimized by criminals.\n[19] Objective credible evidence has established that deportees to Honduras face an elevated risk of harm and that deportees with the Appellant's personal characteristics face a risk of harm or death in Honduras that is further elevated.\n[20] The deteminative issue in this case is whether or not the Appellant faces a particular personal risk that is distinguishable from the general risk in Honduras.\n[21] Case law has established that a risk may be a generalized risk if it is a risk faced by thousands or even hundreds of individuals with the same risk profile of the Appellant. There is no evidence before me regarding the number of indivuduals who are returned to Honduras from Canada and their subsequent fate in Honduras. Since all such indviduals would not have left Honduras as children, it is reasonable to conclude however that there is a smaller number of individuals returned to Honduras with a risk profile similar to the Appellant than the overall number of returnees.\n[22] Case law has also established that an individual may face a individualized personal risk from criminality even though the population as a whole, or a large subset thereof, faces a general risk from criminality.\nCONCLUSION\n[23] Based on the Appellant's particular profile of a young male who does not look or present as a local Honduran, is and will be preceived to be a deportee, and who does not have the survival skills to mitigate the risk of harm inherent in his situation; I find that his risk of harm is not faced generally by individuals from Honduras and is individualized to him.\n[24] I find that, on a balance or probabilites, the Appellant faces a risk to life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Honduras.\nDETERMINATION\n[25] The appeal is allowed. Pursuant to section 111(1)(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act,8 the RAD sets aside the determination of the RPD and substitutes its own determination that the Appellant is a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\n\"Michael J.

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] XXXX XXXX (Appellant) claims to be a Chinese citizen of Tibetan ethnicity, living in India. He appeals a decision of the RPD denying his claim for refugee protection. The Appellant asks that the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) set aside the decision of the RPD and substitute its own determination that he is a Convention refugee. In the alternative, the Appellant asks that the matter be referred back to the RPD to a differently-constituted panel.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] Pursuant to Section 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), the RAD confirms the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. This appeal is dismissed.\nBACKGROUND\n[3] The Appellant was born in India on XXXX XXXX, 1988 of Tibetan parents and alleges that he does not have citizenship in India. His parents left China for India due to Chinese government oppression.\n[4] In XXXX 2011, the appellant married a US citizen. She sponsored him to the US and was issued a US permanent resident card. In XXXX 2013 his wife informed him that she wanted a divorce. He then traveled to Canada and filed a refugee protection claim in December 2013. He considers himself to be a Tibetan national and testified that he will not seek citizenship in China. He is a follower of the Dalai Lama and fears deportation to China where he could be persecuted for his religious beliefs.\n[5] The Appellant had a refugee determination hearing over two sittings on October 29, 2014 and February 6, 2015. The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration intervened before the RPD in writing and argued that the Appellant was excluded under article 1E. In a decision of April 8 2015 he was excluded from refugee protection pursuant to article 1E of the United Nations Convention on the Status of Refugees and section 98 or Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[6] The Appellant submits that the RPD erred in finding that he was excluded under Article 1 E and further in finding that he was stateless.\nROLE OF THE RAD\n[7] Counsel has made submissions in regard to the role that the RAD plays in the review of an RPD decision. However, the RAD finds that the recent Federal Court decision, in Huruglica,1 provides the RAD with guidance in relation to the appropriate standard that must be applied by a specialized tribunal such as the RAD to decisions of a first-level administrative tribunal. Justice Phelan states in paragraphs 54 and 55 of the foregoing decision:\n[54] Having concluded that the RAD erred in reviewing the RPD's decision on the standard of reasonableness, I have further concluded that for the reasons above, the RAD is required to conduct a hybrid appeal. It must review all aspects of the RPD's decision and come to an independent assessment of whether the claimant is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. Where its assessment departs from that of the RPD, the RAD must substitute its own decision.\n[55] In conducting its assessment, it can recognize and respect the conclusion of the RPD on such issues as credibility and\/or where the RPD enjoys a particular advantage in reaching such a conclusion but it is not restricted, as an appellate court is, to intervening on facts only where there is an \"overriding and palpable error\".\n[8] While there has been some conflict in the case law from the Federal Court regarding the standard of review to be applied by the RAD when reviewing RPD decisions, Justice Martineau in Alyafi2 has said that, in the face of this conflict, the Federal Court should allow the RAD to apply either approach as long as the question of the scope of the appellate review of the RPD's decisions has not been settled by a final judgment by the Federal Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court of Canada.\n[9] Accordingly, the RAD will conduct its own assessment of the RPD's decision and come to an independent assessment of whether the Appellant is a Convention refugee or a person is need of protection. Deference will be afforded to the credibility findings of the RPD or to other findings where the RPD has a particular advantage in reaching its conclusions.\nMERITS OF THE APPEAL\nArticle 1E\n[10] In its decision, the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) panel found that the Appellant had permanent status in the US, however, he lost that status voluntarily to come to Canada and therefore engaged in country shopping.\n[11] Article 1E of UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees states:\nThis convention shall not apply to a person who is recognized by the competent authorities of the country in which he has taken residence as having the rights and obligations which are attached to the possession of nationality of that country. The UNCR Handbook provides further guidance at paragraph 144:3\nThis provision relates to persons who might otherwise qualify for refugee status and who have received in a country where they have been granted most of the rights normally enjoyed by nationals, but not formal citizenship.\n[12] The RPD relied in part on the Federal Court of Appeal decision in Canada vs. Zeng & Feng.4 The analysis as established in Zeng is paraphrased and adapted to the facts of this case as follows:\n1. Did the Appellant, as of the date of his application for protection in Canada, have status in a third country, in this case, the United States, to which are attached rights and obligations recognized by the competent authorities of that country to be equivalent to those attached to the possession of the nationality of the country?\nIf the answer to that question is \"no\", then the applicant is not excluded under Article 1 E. If the answer to that question is \"yes\", then the decision-maker should go on to the following question:\n2. Would the Appellant, if he attempted to enter the country in question, in this case, the United States, on the date their refugee claim was determined, on a balance of probabilities, have been admitted to the country in question with status equivalent to that which they had on the date they applied for protection in Canada?\n3. If the Appellant would not be admitted to the country in question, in this case United States, could the appellant have prevented that result and, if so, did they have good and sufficient reason for failing to do so?\nIf the Appellant could have preserved his right to be permitted entry and failed to do so without good and sufficient reason for failing to do so, the Appellant should be excluded under Article 1E. If the Appellant could not have preserved their right of entry or could have but provided a good and sufficient reason for failing to do so, then he should not be excluded under Article 1E.\n[13] The Appellant submits that the RPD was correct in finding that he once enjoyed permanent status in the US but lost it prior to the hearing. The Appellant argues however that he RPD erred in its analysis of the Zeng factors to be considered in determining whether or not he ought to be excluded. In particular, the Appellant argues that the RPD erred in its assessment of the voluntary or involuntary nature of the loss of his permanent status. He submits that the RPD ought not to have 'held it against\" him that he did not apply for the termination of the condition on his permanent residence. He argues that it was irrational to pursue his rights in light of the undisputed evidence that he had been told expressly by immigration officials upon entering the US that he would be removed to India if he separated or got divorced within the two year period of his permanent residency. He further argues that the fact that he is not uneducated does not make it any more unreasonable for him to believe what the authorities told him. The fault lies with those individuals who misled him about the regulations, not with him.\n[14] The RAD is not persuaded by the Appellant's argument in this regard. As noted by the RPD, and undisputed by the Appellant, the provisions of the Appellant's conditional permanent residency enabled him to apply for the removal the conditions of his status. The eligibility criteria specifically states that the Appellant could apply to remove the conditions on his permanent residency if he could establish that he \"entered into a marriage in good faith, but the marriage ended through divorce or annulment\". The Appellant has alleged that he entered into his marriage in good faith but that his wife initiated divorce proceeding prior to end of the two year requirement.\n[15] Although he has alleged that he was deceived by an officer in immigration that he would be returned to India if he divorced or separated within the two years, there is insufficient evidence to establish that was the case. The evidence in the record reveals that the eligibility criteria are posted on the US Immigration Services website. The RAD finds that it makes little sense that immigration authorities would intentionally deceive the Appellant on this issue when the information to the contrary was widely available.\n[16] The Appellant testified that he did not approach US immigration authorities to ascertain what he could do to remove the conditions of his residency \"because he did not know anything about it.\" The RAD notes that the Appellant has testified that he took the steps to research his Indian citizenship status on the Internet. The RAD finds it reasonable to expect he would do the same regarding his status in the US.\n[17] The RAD also agrees with the RPD that the Appellant is a sophisticated individual. He has seven years of university and has a degree is Tibetan Buddhist philosophy. Furthermore, the Appellant had access to the assistance of family living in the US. In particular, the RAD noted that the Appellant testified that he went to reside with his sister after his relationship with his spouse soured. The Appellant's explanation for not asking for assistance from his sister was that she was uneducated and busy with her own family and there was not any way for her to know [ about the sponsorship process]. The RAD finds that the Appellant's explanation is thin at best. As noted by the RPD, the Appellant's sister had been sponsored by her husband several years previous and the Appellant has the opportunity to request the assistance of his sister's husband who may have had some familiarity with the process, or contact with individuals who could assist him. The RAD agrees with the RPD that it is unreasonable that the Appellant would not seek out the assistance of his family.\n[18] The RAD also finds that the Appellant's explanation for not seeking legal advice was unreasonable. He stated that he was new in the US and did not know that he should seek advice. As noted by the RPD, and recognized by the RAD, the Appellant has alleged that he feared returning to India because he believed he would be returned to China and face persecution there as a Tibetan. The RAD notes that it was for that very reason the Appellant sought and obtained legal advice for his refugee protection claim in Canada. The RAD finds it reasonable to expect that he would have at the very least taken some initial steps to seek advice in the US.\n[19] The Appellant also submits that his failure to claim asylum in the US is not relevant to exclusion under Article 1E. He argues that it is only relevant to the extent that it involves the voluntary loss of his permanent status in order to claim in Canada and irrelevant to his attempts or lack of attempts to retain his permanent status in the US.\n[20] The RAD is not persuaded by the appellant's argument in this regard. The RAD finds that the failure to seek asylum in the US undermines his testimony that the reason he did not take steps to retain his residency was because he was told by Immigration authorities he was going to be sent back to India if his marriage collapsed. The RAD agrees with the RPD that the Appellant's decision to abandon his concrete status in the US for uncertain status in Canada without taking any steps to retain his residency status in the US or seek the protection of the US, undermines his subjective fear and his credibility, implying that the Appellant is engaging in asylum shopping.\n[21] The Appellant also submits that the in order to cancel his conditional status in the US, he would have had to show that he would suffer extreme hardship in India, his country of residence. He argues that the RPD itself has found that he was not at risk there and as such his application for the removal of that condition would have failed.\n[22] The RAD is not persuaded by the Appellant's argument. The RAD notes that the Appellant did not make any effort and even put his mind to the notion of making an application for removal of the condition of his residency. Furthermore, the RAD finds that the Appellant cannot assume that the assessment of risk that the RPD analyzed would be the same as the assessment of extreme hardship that would have been done by US authorities. The Appellant has not provided persuasive evidence that these assessments can be equated.\n[23] The Appellant further submits that the RPD assessment of whether he could return to the US was erroneous and deficient. He argues that the question of whether or not he can return is an assessment which needs to be considered at the time that the hearing took place. He argues that at the time of the hearing, he had lost his status and was notified in writing that the decision was final with no right of appeal. Without any evidence of a right to appeal he could not return to the US. In addition, the Appellant argues that the RPD compounded the error by requiring him to prove he had exhausted all options in the U.S. The Appellant argues that this is an error in law as the onus in exclusion matters rests with the Minister, not the Appellant.\n[24] The RAD is not persuaded by the Appellant's argument in this regard. The RAD that the evidence in the record establishes a prima facie case that the Appellant has permanent residency status in the US at the time of making his refugee claim in Canada. As such, the burden of establishing that does not have permanent residency in the US shifts to him.\n[25] Furthermore, while it is true the RPD conducted an assessment of the Appellant's lack of effort to confirm his status in the US after he lost his status; the RAD finds that the RPD's assessment in this regard was not an important consideration in the determination of exclusion. The RAD finds after its own review and assessment of the evidence that the Appellant could have prevented that result and, has not provided good and sufficient reason for failing to do so. In accordance with the factors as set out in Zeng, if the Appellant could have preserved his right to be permitted entry and failed to do so without good and sufficient reason for failing to do so, the Appellant should be excluded under Article 1E.\n[26] Accordingly, the RAD agrees with the RPD and finds that the Appellant is excluded from refugee protection pursuant to Article 1E of the United Nations Convention of the Status of Refugees and section 98 or the Immigration and Refugee protection Act.\n(signed)\n\"L.

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (\"the Appellant\") is a stateless Palestinian who has resided in Saudi Arabia for most of his life. He fears persecution in Gaza, which he believes is one of his countries of former habitual residence (\"CFHR\") despite never having lived there. He also fears persecution in Saudi Arabia due to his identity as a stateless Palestinian, and as a liberal and secular Muslim. The Refugee Protection Division (\"RPD\") rejected the Appellant's refugee claim. The Appellant challenges this decision. He argues that the RPD erred in determining that he does not face treatment amounting to persecution in Saudi Arabia. He submits that Palestine should have been identified as a CFHR. As he faces serious risks in Gaza, and as it is the only place to which he can return, the Appellant believes the Refugee Appeal Division (\"RAD\") should assess his risks there, in order to avoid a violation of the principle of non-refoulement.\n[2] Pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (\"IRPA\"), the appeal is dismissed. The RPD correctly identified Saudi Arabia as the sole CFHR. Although the Appellant cannot return there, his inability to return and his treatment in Saudi Arabia as a foreign national result from an ordinary law of general application. I am unpersuaded by the Appellant's arguments about discrimination amounting cumulatively to persecution in Saudi Arabia. The RPD correctly concluded that the Appellant was not credible in relation to his testimony about his profile as a secular, liberal Muslim. As for the possibility of refoulement to Gaza, the jurisprudence establishes that the risks relevant to the analysis under sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA are the risks that exist in the CFHR. As Gaza is not a CFHR, the possibility of refoulement to Gaza does not fall within the scope of the analysis. The Federal Court jurisprudence is consistent on this point, and I am bound to apply it. I confirm the RPD's negative decision. The Appellant is neither a Convention refugee, nor a person in need of protection.\nBACKGROUND\n[3] The Appellant was born in Saudi Arabia to stateless Palestinian parents from Gaza. The Appellant has never lived in Gaza. He has been there only twice, for family vacations as a child. The Appellant lived in Saudi Arabia initially under his father's sponsorship, since his father had a Saudi employer. However, after the Appellant graduated from university in 2015, he required his own sponsor to maintain his immigration status. This proved to be difficult, due to Saudization policies. These policies prioritize the hiring of Saudis over foreign nationals by requiring a certain proportion of employees to be Saudi nationals. The Appellant was able to find a sponsor, but in exchange for sponsorship, he was required to pay the sponsor XXXX Saudi riyals each month. The sponsor did not have much work for him, and the Appellant made his earnings on commissions.\n[4] However, in XXXX 2018, the Appellant received a termination letter from the company, indicating that they would not be able to renew the contract any further. As the Appellant was not able to find work in his field, he believed he would lose his residency in Saudi Arabia and be forced to move to Gaza. The Appellant alleges that, as a foreign national in Saudi Arabia and as a Palestinian, he faced constant harassment and mistreatment from authorities. He faced delays in renewing documents, arbitrary questioning from police, and frequent encounters with religious police. The Appellant describes that religious police forced him to pray. He worried that his preferred hair grooming and style choices would lead to problems with religious police. Therefore, the Appellant planned to leave Saudi Arabia. His Canadian visa applications were all refused. As the Appellant already had a United States visa, he used it to reach the Canada-United States border in late XXXX 2018, where he crossed irregularly and initiated a claim for refugee protection.\n[5] The RPD heard the Appellant's claim on October 2, 2019. In a written decision, dated October 31, 2019, the RPD rejected the claim. The RPD identified Saudi Arabia as the sole CFHR, and therefore assessed the Appellant's claim only against that country. The RPD found that the Appellant had embellished some of his allegations about discrimination. Upon clarifying the Appellant's evidence in the hearing, the RPD understood that there were other factors that accounted for what the Appellant had perceived as discriminatory treatment. The RPD was not persuaded on a balance of probabilities that the Appellant's Palestinian identity was the reason for his upsetting encounters with authorities. The RPD also identified an inconsistency in the Appellant's evidence about his religious profile, which caused it to reject the Appellant's allegation of being forced to attend prayers against his will. In any event, the RPD noted that reforms in 2016 had curtailed the enforcement powers of religious police, and they were no longer able to investigate, detain, or conduct arrests. After the introduction of these reforms, the religious police were reportedly less visibly present and active.\n[6] The RPD acknowledged that the Appellant was disadvantaged, as compared to Saudi nationals, in many respects and especially in securing employment. He required a sponsor to work and remain in Saudi Arabia. And, given the circumstances of his exit, he was no longer able to return to Saudi Arabia. However, the RPD considered that the Appellant's differential treatment in Saudi Arabia resulted from an ordinary law of general application affecting all foreign nationals in the country. The RPD found that this, including the Appellant's inability to re-enter Saudi Arabia, was not persecutory. The RPD also noted how there was evidence to suggest that Palestinians were exempt from certain penalties for foreign nationals overstaying their status. As the Appellant would only be able to return to Saudi Arabia in a legal manner, the RPD found his fears of arrest and detention upon return were not well founded.\nRole of the Refugee Appeal (\"RAD\") Division\n[7] The jurisprudence establishes that the RAD is required to undertake an independent assessment of the evidence and reach its own determination. Deference is owed to the RPD only where the RPD held a meaningful advantage in assessing evidence.1 I see no reason, in the present case, to show deference to the RPD's findings. I have therefore applied a correctness standard throughout this decision.\nAdmissibility of New Evidence and Request for an Oral Hearing\n[8] The Appellant has provided the following new evidence in his appeal:\ni. News articles on the Saudization process and foreign workers in Saudi Arabia;2\nii. An affidavit from a legal assistant and an excerpt of a Basis of Claim (\"BOC\") form, pertaining to decisions issued by the same RPD panel in other cases, where the RPD identified a CFHR despite the claimants making only short visits to the country;3\niii. An affidavit from a former staff member at XXXX XXXX XXXXof Palestine in Jeddah, speaking to incidents of long-term detention of Palestinians in Saudi Arabia, dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, along with various documents supporting her credentials;4\niv. An article from The Guardian, dated August 16, 2019, which is referred to by the affiant in item (iii) and discusses the deportation of foreigners from Saudi Arabia;5 and\nv. An affidavit from the Appellant, responding to the RPD's findings.6\n[9] Items (i) to (iii) will be admitted, however, items (iv) and (v) are inadmissible.\n[10] Subsection 110(4) of the IRPA states that, on appeal, the person who is the subject of the appeal may present only evidence that arose after the rejection of their claim or that was not reasonably available, or that the person could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the claim's rejection. If the new evidence meets the requirements of subsection 110(4) of the IRPA, the RAD must then consider factors around the credibility, relevance, and newness of the evidence.7\nItem (i): News articles about Saudization\n[11] The two articles at item (i) are dated November 26, 2019 and November 5, 2019. They discuss the process of Saudization and how it has continued with the nationalization of various sectors of the economy, including the planned nationalization of the industrial sector by 2021. The government warned that foreign workers who violated residency and labour regulations faced the possibility of deportation, as well as imprisonment and fines. This information, which arose only after the RPD's rejection of the claim, could not have been provided to the RPD. I am satisfied that the sources of information are credible, and that this new information is relevant to the issues raised on appeal. I therefore admit these two articles.\nItem (ii): Evidence pertaining to other RPD decisions on identification if CFHR\n[12] The Appellant has also provided two decisions from the same RPD panel that decided the Appellant's claim. He points out that in these other decisions, the RPD recognized a CFHR even where the claimant had never lived in the CFHR. The decisions come from other clients at his counsel's firm. The Appellant states these decisions are being relied upon as authorities on a question of law. I agree that these RPD decisions are not the kind of evidence contemplated under subsection 110(4) of the IRPA, and I need not consider whether they meet the new evidence requirements as case law will always be considered when argued by a party.\n[13] To the extent that the legal assistant's affidavit and the BOC form excerpt are being relied upon for the facts contained in them, I have considered the requirements of subsection 110(4) of the IRPA and determine that these documents are admissible. The documents provide factual context that is not fully provided in the RPD decisions. Such evidence could not have been provided earlier, as the Appellant's current counsel was only retained for his appeal, and information about these decisions would not have been available to the Appellant's previous counsel. The documents at item (ii) meet each of the Singh\/Raza factors. The documents are admitted.\nItem (iii): Affidavit from former XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX of Palestine\n[14] The RPD seemed to doubt whether stateless Palestinians were subject to the same penalties as other foreign nationals in Saudi Arabia who remained in the country without valid status. The Appellant provides an affidavit from a former XXXX XXXX at the XXXX XXXX of Palestine in Jeddah. The affiant states that she had first-hand experience in hearing about Palestinians who were placed in immigration detention, as the XXXX would receive calls about five times a day about Palestinian foreign workers who had been detained. She confirms that the XXXX would attempt to facilitate deportation, and if this was not possible, to arrange for deportation to third countries, such as Yemen, Sudan, and Turkey. The affiant states that for those without a right of return to any country, long-term detention could take place, and she estimates a period of 1-3 years in detention before finding a solution for such individuals. For those with a right of return to Gaza, a delay of more than a year was possible, as deportation still required coordination with Egyptian authorities.\n[15] There is indeed mixed evidence on the possibility of detention and deportation for stateless Palestinians in Saudi Arabia. The Appellant could not reasonably have been expected to provide this type of evidence to the RPD, and he only happened to connect to her through his current counsel. Spelling errors in the affiant's business card, and the XXXX use of Gmail rather than a dedicated domain are perhaps unusual, but I have not identified any issues in the other documents supporting the affiant's credentials. For the purposes of admissibility, I consider the affiant's evidence to be sufficiently credible. The affidavit brings new information about the long-term detention of stateless Palestinians in Saudi Arabia, which is relevant to the arguments in the Appellant's memorandum. The affidavit will be admitted.\nItem (iv): Article from The Guardian\n[16] The remaining documents are not admissible.\n[17] The article from The Guardian is contained as an exhibit to the affidavit at item (iii). The affiant refers to how there are reports in the media about the treatment of foreigners. She cites this news article as an example. However, the possibility of immigration detention in Saudi Arabia was a fear the Appellant raised in his hearing, and the RPD identified the well-foundedness of his fears as an issue from the very outset. The article from The Guardian is dated August 16, 2019, which is prior to the rejection of the Appellant's claim. The Appellant could reasonably have been expected to provide this evidence to the RPD to support the fears alleged in his hearing. As the article does not meet any of the criteria under subsection 110(4) of the IRPA, it will not be admitted.\nItem (v): the Appellant's affidavit\n[18] The Appellant's affidavit - item (v) - simply responds to the RPD's various findings. He provides further explanations for the discrepancy between his oral testimony and his BOC narrative. He states that he explained the very same things to his former lawyer as he explained to the RPD during his oral hearing, about his journey of questioning his faith and ultimately turning away from religion. This somehow did not make its way into the narrative, and the Appellant did not read the narrative as being incorrect. He states he interpreted the BOC narrative to mean that he no longer prays and does what Muslims are expected to do. Had he known the importance of this issue, he would have clarified in the narrative that he no longer prays at all. The Appellant responds to the RPD's finding about reforms to the religious police. He says he still hears about people being detained for doing things like speaking freely in public or socializing with the opposite sex. He also responds to the RPD's statements about his involvement in paying his sponsor to maintain his immigration status. He says he has heard of Palestinians being detained while awaiting deportation.\n[19] The Appellant argues that his affidavit is admissible because he could not have responded to the RPD's decision until the decision was issued. He says his affidavit provides helpful context to decide the correctness of the RPD's credibility finding. However, the matters discussed in the affidavit were all reasonably foreseeable as issues that would be addressed in the RPD's decision. During the hearing, the RPD confronted the Appellant about what it saw as a contradiction between his testimony and his narrative regarding his religious beliefs. The Appellant was given the opportunity to address the issue at that time. The Appellant also testified about his fears of the religious police, and of immigration detention and deportation, but the RPD identified the well-foundedness of his fears as an issue in the claim. The Appellant, who was represented by counsel, had a fair opportunity to address these concerns at his hearing. I am not persuaded that this affidavit meets any of the criteria under subsection 110(4) of the IRPA.\nRequest for an oral hearing\n[20] The Appellant requests an oral hearing in the event that the RAD does not grant him refugee protection. However, the only new evidence admitted are items (i) through (iii). These do not raise any serious issues with respect to the Appellant's credibility. As the requirements of subsection 110(6) of the IRPA have not been met, the request for an oral hearing is denied.\nANALYSIS\n[21] The Appellant raises the following issues in this appeal:\na) Whether the RPD erred by failing to recognize Palestine as a country of former habitual residence;\nb) Whether the RPD erred in its assessment of the risks faced by the Appellant in Saudi Arabia; and\nc) Whether the RAD should consider the possibility of refoulement to Gaza, and the risks that exist for the Appellant there.\n[22] These issues are addressed below.\na) Whether the RPD erred by failing to recognize Palestine as a country of former habitual residence\n[23] The RPD identified Saudi Arabia as the sole CFHR, and I see no error in this determination.\n[24] The RPD rejected the assertion that Palestine could be a CFHR, citing the Federal Court's decision in Maarouf.8 In that decision, the Federal Court held that in order to identify a country as a CFHR, the claimant must have established a significant period of de facto residence in the country in question. In the present case, the Appellant has never resided in Gaza. He visited Gaza in 1999 as a child, for a period of three weeks, for a family vacation. He returned there for another family vacation in 2005 for one month. The RPD considered that these visits had no significance beyond being family vacations. There was no view to establishing continuing residence there for a certain period.\n[25] The Appellant argues that Palestine must be identified as a CFHR in his particular case. He submits that while the RPD considered Maarouf, it did not follow what the decision actually says. According to the Appellant, the decision does not stand for the proposition that a CFHR must be a place where the claimant has entered with the intention of settling there. He believes Maarouf called for a liberal interpretation. The Court stated that, \"...the definition of a [CFHR] should not be unduly restrictive so as to pre-empt the provision of 'surrogate' shelter to a stateless person who has demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution...\".9 The Appellant also highlights how there is no minimum period of residence required to find a CFHR, and that the concept of \"former habitual residence\" seeks to establish a relationship to a state which is broadly comparable to that between a citizen and their country of nationality.\n[26] The Appellant also relies on the Federal Court's decision in Al-Khateeb,10 where the Court held that a short period of time could also be significant. The Appellant says that he, like the applicant in Al-Khateeb, has rights akin to citizenship in Palestine. He possesses a Palestinian ID and passport. He is legally allowed to return to Gaza and reside there.\n[27] The Appellant argues that the literal meaning of a CFHR should not defeat the critical question of whether the place in question is one where the claimant's relationship is most comparable or analogous to that of a citizen and their country of nationality. The only thing that makes him stateless is the fact that Palestine is not internationally recognized as a state. The Appellant also submits that the principle of non-refoulement favours his interpretation, which aligns the risk assessment to the place where the Appellant will be returned. He says that if Gaza is not considered a CFHR, his risk there can never be assessed under the IRPA.\n[28] I must admit I find the Appellant's argument to be compelling in many ways. Were it not for Palestine's lack of international recognition as a state, Palestine would properly have been a country of nationality, against which the RPD would have been required to assess his claim. It seems incongruous, and even contrary to the purposes of the Refugee Convention and the IRPA, to disconnect the risk assessment from the only place to which the Appellant can return. However, as I explain further below, the argument advanced by the Appellant has been considered by the Federal Court on several occasions. I am bound by the Federal Court's jurisprudence, which unequivocally rejects the Appellant's interpretation. At a minimum, some period of residence is required in the CFHR, and the residence must be significant in some sense.\n[29] The case law sets out a number of considerations for identifying a country as a CFHR:\n* Though some period of residence is required, there is no minimum period of residence required for a country to be considered a CFHR;11\n* A \"significant\" period of de facto residence must be established in the CFHR;12\n* \"Significant\" can mean something other than a substantial period of time - a short period can be significant;13 and\n* A country's issuance of a travel document and even the right to reside in that country are not necessarily evidence of a CFHR.14\n[30] The Appellant places great emphasis on Al-Khateeb, however the RPD correctly addressed this decision in its reasons. The RPD found it was distinguishable because the significance of the applicant's six months of residence in Al-Khateeb was tied to the applicant's birth in Gaza. The Federal Court considered that the birth's occurrence in Gaza gave the applicant his rights of residence and return, and these were akin to rights associated with citizenship. In this way, even the short period of residence in Gaza for six months was at least legally significant. However, in the present case, the Appellant's acquisition of his rights of return and residence in Gaza are not tied to his birth in Gaza. The Appellant was born in Saudi Arabia. The Appellant's family visits to Gaza as a child do not carry any legal significance, nor were they significant in terms of their duration. A cumulative period of less than two months of physical presence in Gaza over the course of the Appellant's entire life cannot meet any definition of \"significant\" or \"habitual residence\".\n[31] The Appellant's reliance on his possession of a Palestinian Authority passport and identification card are also misplaced. Though these could be seen as establishing rights akin to citizenship, the jurisprudence rejects the notion that travel documents and rights of residence are determinative evidence of a CFHR. At a minimum, the Appellant must have resided in Gaza for it to be considered a CFHR. In Kadoura,15 the Federal Court considered the situation of a stateless Palestinian who was born in the United Arab Emirates (\"UAE\"), who asserted a claim against Lebanon. The applicant possessed a Lebanese travel document and other documents issued by the Lebanese government. Despite having the right to reside in Lebanon, the applicant had never actually resided there, and the Federal Court found it was reasonable to conclude that Lebanon was not a CFHR.16\n[32] Similarly, in Qassim,17 the Federal Court considered the situation of a stateless Palestinian from the UAE who asserted a claim against Iraq. The applicant possessed Iraqi travel documents and an identity card, but he had only traveled to Iraq twice, for eight weeks and then for five weeks. Even coupled with his residency documents and family ties in Iraq, the RPD had reasonably found that there was no significant period of de facto residence in Iraq. The Court expressly rejected the notion that family ties were more important than the period of duration.18\n[33] It is worth keeping in mind that while the identification of Gaza as a CFHR is the Appellant's desired outcome in the present claim, there are many situations where the identification of a CFHR based only on short visits to the country would unfairly disadvantage a stateless claimant. In my view, the jurisprudence suggests that once a period of residence is established, it may be possible to look to potentially relevant factors. These might include the claimant's possession of travel documents and rights of residence, family history and ties, or the claimant's pattern of physical presence in the country, in order to assess whether there is a relationship to the state broadly comparable to that between a citizen and their country of nationality. This would distinguish places where a claimant's residence was a clearly temporary and transient situation, for example to complete a course of studies, compared to a place where the claimant had centred their existence. However, a threshold question is whether there is a significant period of de facto residence. Absent this, the country cannot be a CFHR. I therefore agree with the RPD's conclusion that short childhood visits to Gaza were insufficient to identify Gaza as a CFHR.\n[34] I am not persuaded by the Appellant's reliance on other decisions from the same RPD panel, where the panel reached different conclusions about the existence of a CFHR. It is unclear why the RPD chose to apply the jurisprudence differently in the other two decisions. The first decision refers to the strength of the claimants' family ties to Gaza and their identities as Palestinians.19 The second decision discusses frequent visits to Lebanon, in addition to the claimants' possession of Lebanese travel documents and rights of residence.20 Despite there being no significant period of de facto residence in these places, the RPD recognized the countries as a CFHR. However, for reasons explained above, I do not agree with the RPD's application of the jurisprudence in those cases. Regardless of these decisions, I find that the RPD correctly applied the jurisprudence in the decision that is the subject of the present appeal.\n[35] There is no error in the RPD's determination of the CFHR in this case. Saudi Arabia is the Appellant's sole CFHR.\nb) Whether the RPD erred in its assessment of the risks faced by the Appellant in Saudi Arabia\n[36] The Appellant disputes the RPD's assessment of his claim against Saudi Arabia. I have carefully considered the Appellant's arguments, but I reach the same conclusion as the RPD. Each of the arguments are addressed in turn.\nErroneous findings\n[37] The Appellant believes the RPD made several erroneous findings, including:\n* Dismissing the Appellant's experiences of mistreatment and discrimination by treating them in isolation, and failing to consider them cumulatively;\n* Showing insensitivity to the Appellant's precarious status in Saudi Arabia by characterizing his agreement with his sponsor as being a mutually beneficial one in which the Appellant did not have \"clean hands\";\n* Expecting the Appellant to look for employment prior to the expiry of his residence permit in fields outside of his residency category of marketing and sales, despite objective evidence about the prospect of detention and deportation in the event he overstayed; and\n* Making a negative credibility finding about the Appellant's testimony on his lack of religious belief, which is reasonably explained by a minor difference in expression or miscommunication between him and his previous lawyer.\n[38] It is important to note that while the RPD described the Appellant's testimony as mostly direct and straightforward, the panel found that there were exaggerations and embellishments designed to bolster his refugee claim. In oral testimony, the Appellant claimed he had faced \"extreme racism\" in Saudi Arabia, but the RPD found this was not necessarily the case. Where it seemed the Appellant was alleging employment discrimination based on his Palestinian identity, upon further clarification, the RPD found that the issue from employers was not with the Appellant's identity as a Palestinian per se, but his status as a foreign national. Employers were required to have a certain proportion of Saudi nationals in their workforce. As for his problems while attending government offices, the Appellant complained of how he was told his sponsor had to accompany him. Again, when this was explored in greater depth, it seemed it was actually the sponsor's responsibility to do things like update his insurance coverage and residency permit, and the sponsor was therefore required to be present. The Appellant was never refused services, and delays of about two months in renewing his driver's license and health coverage were not unreasonably lengthy delays.\n[39] The Appellant claimed that, in 2014, he and two of his friends were approached by police and asked what they were doing. They were searched and taken to the police station. One of the friends was Syrian and another was Palestinian. In 2018, there was another incident when the Appellant and his sister were approached by police and asked about their relationship. The officers left after seeing their identification. There was insufficient evidence to indicate that these incidents occurred because of the Appellant's identity as a Palestinian.\n[40] The RPD cannot seriously be faulted for dismissing these incidents, given that these incidents did not appear to be discriminatory or connected to the Appellant's identity as a Palestinian, even considered alongside the other factors pointed out by the Appellant. Were some of these incidents part of a much greater pattern of mistreatment, or even part of a social or historical context of persecution and discrimination against Palestinians as an oppressed minority in Saudi Arabia, the analysis could very well be different. However, there was insufficient documentary evidence to indicate that Palestinians were an oppressed minority in Saudi Arabia. I am willing to accept that the Appellant was the subject of some periodic, derogatory comments about his Palestinian nationality, for instance in his interaction at a government office where an officer made comments about Hamas. However, the Appellant has not satisfied me that the other incidents alleged were connected to his Palestinian identity. I am therefore not persuaded by the Appellant's arguments about the RPD's failure to consider cumulative discrimination amounting to persecution.\n[41] The RPD accepted that the Appellant was having difficulty securing employment and sponsorship due to his status as a foreign national. However, the RPD determined that the Appellant's entitlements and the work opportunities available to him, though different from Saudi nationals, resulted from a law of general application. Foreign nationals could only be employed if they could secure a sponsor, but this was a policy that applied to all foreign nationals in Saudi Arabia. Saudization policies made it more difficult for foreign nationals to find employment, but these were conditions imposed by the government to regulate the job market, and were not persecutory in nature.\n[42] It is in the context of this analysis that the RPD made its comments about the Appellant's fraudulent arrangement with his sponsor. It is the Appellant's characterization of his sponsorship arrangement as potentially persecutory that the RPD seemed to dispute when it commented that he did not have \"clean hands\". The Appellant perceives this as insensitive, and perhaps it was unintentionally so, given the Appellant's difficult reality in Saudi Arabia as a stateless person. However, the underlying problem that the RPD was pointing to in its reasons was that it did not believe the Appellant was being persecuted by his employer in an exploitative manner. I agree with this assessment. The Appellant testified to how he paid XXXX Saudi riyals (approximately XXXX Canadian dollars) to his sponsor each month. Through this arrangement, the Appellant also received health insurance. The residency permit renewal fee itself was XXXX Saudi riyals. I do not believe this mutually beneficial arrangement is significant evidence of employment discrimination or persecution even when considered cumulatively.\n[43] The RPD's comments about the Appellant's failure to seek other employment opportunities before the expiry of his residence permit were also made in the context of its analysis about a law of general application. In the face of worsening Saudization policies and the Appellant's previous difficulties securing employment, I would not fault the Appellant for seeking possibilities abroad and leaving before the expiry of his residency. However, the RPD's statements on this issue were hardly determinative. The true matter at issue is whether the Appellant's inability to maintain his status and pursue work opportunities constituted persecution on a Convention ground. I address this matter further below.\n[44] As for the credibility of the Appellant's testimony about his religious beliefs, I am in complete agreement with the RPD. The Appellant's testimony was not consistent with his BOC form. In oral testimony, the Appellant described that he was no longer a practicing Muslim, or as the Appellant describes in his argument, a \"secular Muslim\"21. The following exchange took place in the hearing:\nMember: So, why would you go outside during enforced prayer times?\nClaimant: So, for instance, I'm going for a walk or running an errand or anything of the sort, and besides, I don't want to pray. There's a lot of things I don't want to practice even though I'm a Muslim. I'm not convinced by it. And people are forcing me to do it.22\n[45] The Appellant went on to describe that he has not prayed as a Muslim since 2009, that there were a lot of things about Islam he was not convinced of, and that he was being forced to do these things. However, the Appellant's BOC narrative merely states that although he considers himself a Muslim, he does not always pray in the mosque and he does not follow the fundamentalist version of Islam enforced in Saudi Arabia.23\n[46] The RPD pointed out how the BOC narrative omits any mention of his refusal to pray, and how it instead says he does not always pray in the mosque. When confronted with the differences between his testimony and his BOC narrative, the Appellant's testimony shifted:\nI haven't prayed since I finished school because at school you have to - in high school you have to pray. I even don't fast even though it's mandatory. What I mean in the story is I don't practice my obligations as a Muslim. I... and I don't pray in a manner where... I don't pray in a manner where it... where... like they... like I should according to the Muslim rituals. That was when I was in school. Currently, I don't pray. I don't fast at all. At all.24\n[47] When asked why he did not mention this in his narrative, the Appellant responded:\nSo, I thought that I don't practice my rituals as a Muslim. I thought that it's understood what I meant. And it didn't occur to me to specifically mention prayers in particular. I have even faced problems with my family because of not fasting, which is considered with my, with my family... yeah. I faced problems with my family because of not fasting, which is considered an obligation in the family. And I have not mentioned that in my narrative.25\n[48] As seen above, the Appellant's testimony was not straightforward. He started by describing a longstanding refusal to follow the Muslim faith since high school, from which time he has not prayed. Only when confronted with the inconsistency in his BOC narrative did he then state that he does pray, but not in a manner that accords with Muslim rituals. Then he shifted back and stated he does not pray, and went on to expose even further omissions about his refusal to fast and the problems this created between him and his family. He explained that he did not think to mention prayers in his BOC narrative.\n[49] The Appellant's new explanation is about miscommunication, misunderstanding, or poor phrasing with his previous lawyer is inadmissible. I agree with the RPD. There is a contradiction in the Appellant's evidence, and his response did not adequately account for this. If, as the Appellant says, he is a liberal and secular Muslim who fears being forced to pray on threat of penalty from religious police, it is reasonable to expect that such allegations would have been included from the very outset of the Appellant's claim. The written narrative makes no mention of the Appellant's misgivings with his faith, that he has stopped praying since high school, or that he refuses to fast. The BOC form did not indicate that he is a liberal, secular Muslim, as described in the memorandum of argument, despite the Appellant's emphatic assertions that this is one of the main grounds for his claim against Saudi Arabia. The Appellant's testimony was not credible, and I find he has not established a genuine desire to stray from religious customs in Saudi Arabia in a manner that would result in persecutory treatment from religious police. I do not accept his allegations about being forced to pray by religious police, nor do I accept that he is a liberal, secular Muslim as he now alleges.\nClaim of persecution on religious and political grounds\n[50] The Appellant says the RPD misapprehended some of the grounds of his claim, which included persecution on religious and political grounds as a liberal and secular Muslim.\n[51] The Appellant emphasizes that his mistreatment from religious police was not based on his identity as a Palestinian. Rather, this was persecution on the ground of religious belief and political opinion. The Appellant believes the RPD misunderstood the nature of this ill-treatment and did not consider it relevant, since it did not relate to his Palestinian identity. He says the RPD did not doubt his experiences of ill-treatment from the religious police. While religious police have had their authority reduced since 2016, the Appellant points to evidence that indicates they continue to police non-Islamic practices and report to other authorities that have the capacity to arrest. Individuals who violate religious standards continue to be detained without charge. The Appellant relies on recent case law criticizing the RPD for dismissing persecutory conditions as merely constituting \"prevailing norms\" in Saudi Arabia.\n[52] Contrary to the Appellant's argument, the RPD did not explicitly accept the Appellant's profile as a liberal and secular Muslim or his allegations about his interactions with religious police; nor do I, for the reasons provided above. In addition, I am not persuaded that the case law relied upon, Abu Dakka,26 should change the outcome of this decision. Abu Dakka spoke to a situation where the RPD dismissed credible testimony about the claimants' interactions with religious police regarding their non-compliance with the dress code for women, and also in the context of gender-based violence and official discrimination in Saudi Arabia.27 By contrast, in the present claim, the RPD's statements about following prevailing cultural norms related to the Appellant's freedom to get short haircuts and wear string bracelets. I would point out that the Appellant had never experienced any problems from religious police on this ground. In his BOC narrative, he merely stated that he worried about it. Even if it could be argued that these style choices may be perceived as religious violations or political expressions, I see little objective support for the Appellant's fears. The documentary evidence does not indicate that there is a serious possibility of persecution from religious police for men on account of the kinds of style choices preferred by the Appellant. The Appellant's fears are not objectively well-founded.\nRisk of immigration detention\n[53] The Appellant fears he will be detained in Saudi Arabia pending deportation to Gaza, and he argues that the RPD wrongly believed Palestinians were exempt from such treatment. While I accept the Appellant's interpretation of the country conditions evidence, I am not satisfied that a serious possibility of persecution arises; nor do I believe there is a danger of torture, a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment on this ground.\n[54] The RPD acknowledged that Saudi authorities had detained and deported undocumented migrants from the country. However, the RPD also cited a report from the National Documentation Package (\"NDP\") for Palestine, which indicated that there were some exemptions in Saudi Arabia for Palestinians and other \"de facto refugees\", such as Rohingya and Syrians.28 It is not entirely clear whether the RPD found that the Appellant could benefit from such exemptions. The panel went on to discuss how the Appellant has no right of return to Saudi Arabia, and that he would be required to return in a legal manner, for instance by finding a sponsor. The RPD found that since the prospect of arrest and detention in Saudi Arabia depended on his ability to return there, these risks were not well-founded.\n[55] The Appellant submits that the RPD wrongly concluded that Palestinians are exempt from immigration detention. He says this was not supported by the evidence in the NDP for Palestine and Saudi Arabia. A senior researcher who was quoted in the very same document relied upon by the RPD stated that Palestinians faced deportation to neighbouring countries, including to the West Bank and Gaza.29 In item 14.9 of the Palestine NDP, a legal researcher, not commenting specifically on Saudi Arabia, stated that Palestinians risked detention and potentially deportation by local authorities in Gulf countries, including the UAE.30 The Appellant also relies on his new evidence from a former staff member at the Palestinian Consulate General in Jeddah about her experience of hearing reports of immigration detention from Palestinians. The Appellant states that Palestinians are treated no differently from other foreign nationals, and that they are in fact subject to immigration detention and deportation. The RPD therefore dismissed the Appellant's fear by relying on an exemption that does not exist in practice.\n[56] The Appellant argues that he would face indefinite immigration detention in Saudi Arabia pending deportation, which can be lengthy even for those with Palestinian travel documents and rights to reside in Gaza. Had he not fled Saudi Arabia before the expiry of his residence permit, he would have been an undocumented migrant who faced arrest for his illegal presence. He describes that there are cruel and inhumane conditions in immigration detention, and that he therefore faces risks under both sections 96 and 97(1) of the IRPA as a result.\n[57] I am willing to accept that some Palestinians may face deportation to Gaza, and that they may be placed in immigration detention pending deportation. The evidence before the RPD was mixed, but I am persuaded by the former consulate staff member's affidavit contained in the Appellant's new evidence. Still, this does not address the RPD's finding about the risk being speculative. The RPD found that these risks were not well-founded because the Appellant would first have to return to Saudi Arabia in a legal manner. The Appellant did not necessarily have to show his ability to return in order for the RPD to consider his risks in Saudi Arabia, but I too find that the risks asserted are speculative. They are premised on the Appellant's ability to return to Saudi Arabia with a new sponsor, which, as he stated in testimony, is not possible. The Appellant testified to how he left Saudi Arabia on an exit re-entry visa, rather than on a final exit visa. He explained that he had not returned to Saudi Arabia during the validity period of that visa, and therefore could no longer return. The country conditions evidence indicates that foreign nationals who leave on an exit re-entry visa and fail to return before their expiry may not be able to apply for a Saudi visa in the future, with one source indicating that there would be a three year ban from re-entering.31\n[58] Not only are the asserted risks premised on the Appellant's ability to return, they are premised on his ability to find a new sponsor. They also depend on the subsequent loss of his sponsorship in the future without being able to transfer his sponsorship to another employer, and then his arrest as an undocumented migrant. There are undoubtedly many stateless Palestinians in Saudi Arabia, the Appellant's family members included, who face similar hypothetical risks. These risks depend on a particular sequence of events occurring and a number of variables. For these reasons, I agree with the RPD's finding about the risk of prolonged immigration detention as an undocumented migrant. Under these circumstances, I determine that the Appellant has not established a serious possibility of persecution; nor has he established, on a balance of probabilities, a danger of torture, a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nDenial of entry to Saudi Arabia\n[59] Finally, it is argued that the denial of a right of return to Saudi Arabia is persecutory. I have carefully considered the Appellant's arguments, but I cannot agree.\n[60] The RPD recognized that a denial of a right to return could itself be persecutory. However, the reasons for denial in this instance were not linked to any Convention ground. The Appellant could not return to Saudi Arabia because his residence permit had expired, and he had remained outside of the country for longer than was permitted. All foreign nationals were required to have a sponsor to secure a residence permit. The denial of the Appellant's return was not based on his Palestinian identity. Rather, it occurred due to a law of general application.\n[61] The Appellant submits that the denial of the Appellant's return constitutes a violation of human rights, given the depth of his connection to Saudi Arabia. Such a denial would prevent the Appellant from returning to his family and would effectively exile him from his place of birth and his home. The Appellant says Saudi Arabia's treatment of stateless Palestinians, particularly those who are born and raised in the country, is a systematic violation of human rights, constituting persecution. Although Saudi citizenship and immigration laws do not specifically target Palestinians, the Appellant says that in other contexts, such as mandatory military service and China's family planning policies, the jurisprudence has recognized that a law of general application can constitute persecution where there is a differential or disproportionate impact on a subset of persons for a Convention reason. The Appellant asks the RAD to consider his predicament rather than the persecutor's intent when interpreting the meaning of persecution.\n[62] The jurisprudence does not support the Appellant's arguments on the issue of the denial of entry. It is possible for persecution to arise from a law of general application. Even where the aim of a law of general application is not persecutory, the state's methods of enforcing it may lead to persecution. The leading case on this issue is Zolfagharkhani,32 where the Federal Court of Appeal set out some general propositions:\n(1) The statutory definition of Convention refugee makes the intent (or any principal effect) of an ordinary law of general application, rather than the motivation of the claimant, relevant to the existence of persecution.\n(2) But the neutrality of an ordinary law of general application, vis-\u00e0-vis the five grounds for refugee status, must be judged objectively by Canadian tribunals and courts when required.\n(3) In such consideration, an ordinary law of general application, even in non-democratic societies, should, I believe, be given a presumption of validity and neutrality, and the onus should be on a claimant, as is generally the case in refugee cases, to show that the laws are either inherently or for some other reason persecutory.\n(4) It will not be enough for the claimant to show that a particular regime is generally oppressive but rather that the law in question is persecutory in relation to a Convention ground.33\n[63] The Federal Court has considered the situation of stateless Palestinians especially in Gulf countries, where immigration laws requiring sponsorship have prevented stateless Palestinians from returning without a sponsor. The Court has consistently rejected the Appellant's position. In Thabet,34 the Federal Court of Appeal examined the situation of a stateless Palestinian who was born in Kuwait and who resided there under his father's sponsorship. The Court of Appeal stated as follows:\nTo ensure that a claimant properly qualifies for Convention refugee status, the Board is compelled to ask itself why the applicant is being denied entry to a country of former habitual residence because the reason for the denial may, in certain circumstances, constitute an act of persecution by the state.35\n[64] In Thabet, the Court of Appeal noted how the appellant's residence permit had expired after he left Kuwait. Though Palestinians had previously been excluded at the conclusion of the Gulf War, policies had changed such that they were receiving extensions of their residence permits in Kuwait. The appellant's inability to return to Kuwait therefore resulted from his lack of a valid residency permit rather than due to his Palestinian nationality. The Court of Appeal found this to be a valid analysis of the issue of whether the denial of entry was persecutory.36 In these situations, the Federal Court has required evidence of persecutory intent or conduct. Even in cases where the denial of entry would cut off the claimant from their place of birth and residence, the Court has consistently rejected the notion that an inability to return following the expiration of a residence permit constitutes persecution.37\n[65] In my view, the Appellant's principal complaint is about Saudi Arabia's handling of the problem of statelessness. He believes the government should have immigration programs in place for people like him, who, by falling outside the eligibility criteria for residence, find themselves in a precarious position without permanent residence or citizenship. The facts of the present appeal are very similar to those considered in the jurisprudence. The reason for the Appellant's inability to return is the expiry of his residence permit in Saudi Arabia and his lack of a sponsor. There is no evidence that the Appellant's inability to return is indicative of persecutorial intent or conduct. Even considered cumulatively alongside the other facts raised, I cannot conclude that the Appellant faces a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground in Saudi Arabia.\nc) Whether the RAD should consider the possibility of refoulement to Gaza, and the risks that exist for the Appellant there\n[66] The final argument relates to whether the RAD should assess the Appellant's risks in Gaza, even without it being considered a CFHR. The Appellant says his refugee claim should not be denied based on hypothetical safety in a country to which he cannot return, and without an assessment of the risks in the only place where he has rights of return and residence. There is no authority to support the Appellant's position on this issue. I am bound by the jurisprudence, which takes a different approach.\n[67] According to the Appellant, the RAD should avoid the consequence of refoulement if there is an interpretation of section 96 of the IRPA that will allow for this. Section 96 reads as follows:\n(a) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or\n(b) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.38\n[68] According to the Appellant, paragraph 96(b) does not necessarily envisage the persecution occurring in the CFHR. It merely requires the claimant to have left the CFHR as a result of their fear of persecution. Under this interpretation, it would be possible for a claimant to have left their CFHR for fear of persecution in some third country, and still be a Convention refugee. If a person left their CFHR for fear of being deported to a country where they would face persecution, as in the Appellant's case, a claim could still be established. The Appellant believes this interpretation accords with the grammatical and ordinary meaning of the refugee definition.\n[69] The above interpretation finds no support in the jurisprudence. On several occasions, the Federal Court has considered situations in which a refugee claimant might face removal from their CFHR to another country. The Court has consistently rejected the Appellant's proposed interpretation.39\n[70] In Marchoud,40 a stateless Palestinian claimed a fear of persecution in Lebanon. However, Lebanon was not a CFHR. Despite the possibility of removal from the CFHR to Lebanon, the Federal Court rejected the argument that the RPD was required to assess the claimant's risk of persecution in Lebanon.41 The Court stated as follows:\nIn my opinion, the panel did not have to carry out this assessment under paragraphs 96(b) and 97(1)(a) of the Act since it is clearly stated therein that the terms \"refugee\" and \"person in need of protection\" include persons who have no nationality and who find themselves in a country where they have their habitual residence. Further, such an analysis would be moot since the risk should be assessed on the day of the hearing and not when such a refoulement by the UAE might later take place.42\n[71] This interpretation was confirmed in a more recent case, Qassim, supra, where the Honourable Madam Justice Kane cited the above passage from Marchoud and stated:\nThis suggests that, in the case of stateless persons, the relevant question to determine whether sections 96 and 97 apply is whether the person will face a risk of persecution or be in need of protection if returned to their CFHR, and not what might occur later if the CFHR seeks to send the person to other countries. Marchoud was applied in Chehade, where the claimant again argued that the RPD erred by not considering whether he would be deported by Saudi Arabia (his CFHR) to Lebanon. The Court found, at paras 24-25, that the RPD need not have considered what might happen if the claimant was deported by Saudi Arabia; the only issue was the treatment he might face in his CFHR.43\n[72] In Qassim, the Court went on to conclude that the RPD was not required to consider whether the CFHR, in that case the UAE, would attempt to remove the applicant to Iraq, or whether he would face persecution there.44\n[73] This is not an area in which there is a gap in the case law or where there is no clear line of jurisprudence. I am bound to apply the interpretation that has been adopted by the Federal Court. The RPD made no error in failing to consider the Appellant's risks in Gaza, since it was not a CFHR.\n[74] The RAD's jurisdiction lies in refugee status determination, i.e. in determining whether the Appellant meets the definition of a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. On this particular question, I find that the Appellant meets neither definition. However, to be clear, in the event of any future application for relief, I have not made any determination regarding the Appellant's risks in Gaza.\nCONCLUSION\n[75] As a stateless Palestinian, the Appellant faces many challenges. He has had enduring, but inherently precarious, status in Saudi Arabia for most of his life. While I am sympathetic to the Appellant's situation, statelessness does not automatically give rise to a claim for refugee protection. The RAD cannot recognize the Appellant as a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection if he does not meet the definitions set out under sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA. Though the Appellant cannot return to Saudi Arabia, the jurisprudence establishes that legal permission to re-enter the country is not required before a country can be considered a CFHR, against which a claim must be established.45\n[76] The Appellant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution in Saudi Arabia on a Convention ground. He also does not, on a balance of probabilities, face a danger of torture, a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. I therefore confirm the RPD's negative decision.\n[77] The appeal is dismissed, pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the IRPA.\n(signed)\nM. Oh\nM.

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] The Principal Appellant, XXXX XXXX, the Co-Appellant, XXXX XXXX, the Minor Appellants, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, are citizens of Czech Republic and appeal a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) dated May 5, 2016 rejecting their claims for refugee protection. The Appellants are not submitting new evidence and are not requesting an oral hearing. The Appellants are requesting that the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) set aside the decision of the RPD and refer the matter back to the RPD, or that the RAD substitute a determination that the Appellants are Convention refugees or persons in need of protection.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] Pursuant to section 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), the Refugee Appeal Division confirms the determination of the Refugee Protection Division that the Appellants are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection.\nBackground\n[3] The principal Appellant fears discrimination and persecution if he were to return to Czech Republic on account of his Roma ethnicity.\n[4] The Adult Appellants travelled to the United Kingdom in XXXX of 2000. The Minor Appellants were born in the United Kingdom.\n[5] The Adult Appellants applied for refugee protection upon their arrival in the United Kingdom but their application was refused. In 2011 the Principal Appellant was convicted of Human Trafficking in the United Kingdom and sentenced to a XXXX XXXX jail term. At the RPD hearing, the Minister intervened and raised the issue of exclusion with respect to the Adult Appellant. After an extensive review of the facts and the law, the RPD found that the principal Appellant was excluded pursuant to Article 1F(b) of the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (the Convention).\n[6] The Appellants returned to the Czech Republic in 2012. They allege that they were assaulted in XXXX of 2015.The Minor Appellant XXXX also provided testimony with respect to his experience in the Czech Republic.\n[7] All of the Appellants arrived in Canada on XXXX of 2015 on a visitor's visa and filed a claim for refugee protection, five months later, in XXXX of 2015.\nROLE OF THE RAD\n[8] The RAD finds that the recent Federal Court of Appeal decision, in Huruglica,1 provides the RAD with guidance in relation to the appropriate standard that must be applied by a specialized tribunal such as the RAD to decisions of a first-level administrative tribunal. The Court stated at paragraphs 103 and 106:\n[103] I conclude from my statutory analysis that with respect to findings of fact (and mixed fact and law) such as the one involved here, which raised no issue of credibility of oral evidence, the RAD is to review RPD decisions applying the correctness standard. Thus, after carefully considering the RPD decision, the RAD carries out its own analysis of the record to determine whether, as submitted by the appellant, the RPD erred. Having done this, the RAD is to provide a final determination, either by confirming the RPD decision or setting it aside and substituting its own determination of the merits of the refugee claim. It is only when the RAD is of the opinion that it cannot provide such a final determination without hearing the oral evidence presented to the RPD that the matter can be referred back to the RPD for redetermination. No other interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions is reasonable.\n[106] In light of paragraphs 23 and 24 above, I would reformulate the certified question as follows:\nWas it reasonable for the RAD to limit its role to a review of the reasonableness of the RPD's findings of fact (or mixed fact and law), which involved no issue of credibility?\nAnswer: No. The RAD ought to have applied the correctness standard of review to determine whether the RPD erred.\n[9] Accordingly, the RAD will conduct its own analysis of the Record to determine if the RPD erred.\nANALYSIS ON THE MERITS OF THE APPEAL\n[10] The RPD found that the Appellants were not credible witnesses. The panel concluded that the Principal Appellant was excluded pursuant to Article 1F(b) of the Convention and that all of the Appellants did not demonstrate that they have a well-founded fear of persecution nor do they a face a risk to life if returned to the Czech Republic.2\n[11] The Principal Appellant is not challenging the finding of the RPD with respect to his exclusion. All of the Appellants are challenging the finding of the RPD with respect to well-founded fear of persecution and risk to life.\nThe Principal Appellant\n[12] The Appellants: \"... do not contest the finding that XXXX XXXX is excluded from refugee protection...\"3 Having analyzed the record and the decision of the RPD with respect to the exclusion issue, the RAD finds that the analysis and reasons of the RPD to be reasonable.\n[13] Furthermore, Article 1F of the 1951 Convention states that the provisions of that Convention \"shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering\" that:\n...\n(b) he [or she] has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his [or her] admission to that country as a refugee; or\n....\n[14] In the Febles decision, the Supreme Court of Canada stated that the purpose of Article 1F(b) is to exclude refugee claimants who have previously committed a serious political crime from seeking refugee protection in Canada. \"Whatever rationales for Article 1F(b) may or may not exist, its purpose is clear in excluding persons from protection who previously committed serious crimes abroad.\"4\n[15] Given the definition of Article 1F(b) and the purpose of the Article as articulated by the Federal Court, the Principal Appellant is excluded from seeking refugee protection in Canada. Therefore, the RAD will only consider the appeal of the Co-Appellant and the Minor Appellants.\nCREDIBILITY\nRe-Availment\n[16] The Appellants testified that between 2000 and 2012, they returned to the Czech Republic approximately five times. The Principal Appellant stated that the reason for their travels to the Czech Republic was to settle problems relating to properties which he owned. The RPD did not accept this explanation and drew a negative inference from the numerous re-availments of the Appellants.\n[17] The Appellants argue that the RPD erred in this conclusion because it failed to take into account the fact that significant incidents of harassment and persecution occurred after the Appellants returned to the Czech Republic in 2012. The RAD cannot agree with this submission. The Appellants did acknowledge that, between 2000 and 2012, they returned to the Czech Republic and therefore re-availed themselves. Upon their arrival in the United Kingdom, the adult Appellants immediately claimed for refugee protection therefore indicating that they alleged persecution in their home state. The RPD questioned why the Appellant would return on five different occasions to a country where they alleged persecution and he replied that he had to settle a property dispute. It is reasonable to expect that individuals who allege harassment and persecution in their home state, and ask protection from a foreign nation, would not have any desire to return to that country. Furthermore, even if the Principal Appellant had to resolve property issues in the Czech Republic, he did not provide a reasonable explanation as to why he needed to bring his entire family with him, including his children. The RAD, therefore, agrees with the RPD that the Appellants have not provided a reasonable explanation for their numerous re-availments to the Czech Republic and that their actions are indicative of a lack of subjective fear.5\nAlleged Assault of XXXX 2015\n[18] The adult Appellants stated that they were assaulted in XXXX of 2015 and that the Principal Appellant had been beaten. The RPD concluded that the Appellants were not credible witnesses with respect to this incident. The Appellants submit that the RPD erred in its credibility analysis with respect to the assault.\n[19] The RPD questioned the Co-Appellant with respect to the incident. She testified that, after the assault, the Principal Appellant reported the incident to the police, who wrote a report and told him that they would contact him at a future date. However, the Principal Appellant was not contacted by the police. Although the Co-Appellant did not herself attend at the police station, she testified that the Principal Appellant had told her that he had reported the incident to the police.\n[20] The RPD pointed out to the Co-Appellant that, when they described this incident in their Basis of Claim form (BOC), they had written that the Principal Appellant had not reported the incident to the police. The Co-Appellant replied that, maybe, she had misunderstood the information. The RPD then asked the Co-Appellant how she knew that the Principal Appellant had reported the incident to the police and that the police had taken a report and she replied that she assumed those facts.\n[21] The RPD then questioned the Principal Appellant with respect to whether he had actually reported the matter to the police and he stated that he did not because he thought that they would do nothing. He did confirm that he had provided false information to his wife in telling her that he had actually reported the incident to the police.\n[22] Based on the contradictory evidence between the written and oral testimony of the Appellant with respect to whether the Principal Appellant did actually report the incident to the police, and on the fact that the Principal Appellant admitted that he had lied to the Co-Appellant with respect to reporting the incident to the police, the RPD concluded that the adults Appellants were not credible witnesses.\n[23] The Appellants submit that the inconsistency in the testimony of their testimony with respect to the report to the police was not central to the issue.6 The RAD cannot agree with this submission. First of all, it is a central issue in that it demonstrates whether the Appellants had sought state protection as a result of the incident. Secondly, from the RAD's point of view, the testimony of the Appellants with respect to whether a police report had been filed was more than inconsistent: it was full of discrepancies and untruthfulness. In their submissions, the Appellants do not provide any explanation for the discrepancy between the written and oral testimony of the Appellants with respect to reporting to the police, nor do they offer any explanation as to why the Principal Appellant deliberately lied to the Co-Appellant with respect to reporting the incident to the police.\n[24] It is reasonable to have expected the Co-Appellant to have inquired of the Principal Appellant as to whether in fact he had filed a police report and what the re-action of the police had been. Rather, she simply assumed that a police report had been filed. Likewise, it is reasonable to have expected the Principal Appellant to have been truthful with the Co-Appellant as to whether he had actually filed a complaint with the police.\n[25] The RAD therefore agrees with the conclusion of the RPD that alleged assault of XXXX 2015 did not occur and that the Appellants have not established that they hava a well-founded fear of persecution.\nThe Minor Appellant XXXX\n[26] With respect to the testimony of the minor Appellant XXXX, the RPD found that his testimony was consistent with respect to his experiences but that it did not outweigh the credibility concerns. The Appellants submit that the Minor Appellant XXXX could not be blamed for the testimony of the adult Appellants. The RAD agrees with this submission and will conduct its own independent assessment of XXXX testimony as found on the record.\n[27] The RAD has had an opportunity to read the transcript of the RPD hearing provided by the Appellants. The Minor Appellant XXXX was questioned by his counsel. XXXX complained that, after returning to the Czech Republic, the educational authorities wished to place him in a segregated school for Roma children. He speculated as to how he would have been treated in a segregated school.7 However, XXXX did testify that he was not placed in a segregated school but attended a regular school8 and that he was the only Roma student in his class.\n[28] With respect to his personal experience, XXXX mentioned one incident where he alleges that he was assaulted.\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\n[29] In this particular example, XXXX testimony is not clear as to who exactly assaulted him. He did not provide convincing evidence that the assailants were students from his school and that the assault was racially motivated.\n[30] XXXX was then asked the following question by his counsel:\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX9.\n[31] However the RAD finds this to a leading question asked by counsel and therefore gives it no evidentiary weight.\n[32] With respect to how the family was allegedly treated when going to a restaurant, he stated:\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX10.\n[33] There is no evidence in this testimony that the Appellants were denied service because of their ethnicity. It is possible, and there is no evidence to the contrary, that the restaurant was indeed closing.\n[34] After having read the testimony of the Minor Appellant XXXX, the RAD concludes that he has not established that he has a well-founded fear of persecution.\nCONCLUSION\n[35] Having found that the Appellants have not established that they have a well-founded fear of persecution, the RAD agrees with the RPD that the Appellants would not face persecution simply because of their race.11\nDECISION\n[36] Pursuant to section 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the Refugee Appeal Division confirms the determination of the Refugee Protection Division that the Appellants are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection.\n[37] The Appeal is dismissed.\n(signed)\n\"Pasquale Fiorino\"\nPasquale Fiorino\nSeptember 7, 2016\nDate\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD.25.02 (June 23, 2014)\nRAD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SAR : TB6-06689\nTB6-06693\nTB6-06694\nTB6-06695\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] Mr. XXXX XXXX, a citizen of India, appeals a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejecting his claim for refugee protection.\n[2] The Tribunal has read the Appellant's Record, reviewed all documentary evidence submitted before the RPD and has listened to the recording of the hearing. No new evidence was submitted to the RAD under s. 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c. 27 (hereafter, the \"Act\") and an oral hearing before the RAD was not requested under s. 110(6) of the Act.\nDETERMINATION OF THE APPEAL\nConfirms RPD determination\n[3] Pursuant to ss. 111(1)(a) of the Act, the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) confirms the determination of the RPD, namely, that Mr. XXXX XXXX is not a \"Convention Refugee\" pursuant to s. 96 of the Act nor is he a person in need of protection pursuant to s. 97 of the Act.\nBACKGROUND\nBasis of the claim\n[4] The Appellant alleges that he fears the police in India because of his ties with two friends who are members of the Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar) political party and are considered militants by the authorities. The Appellant alleges that his two friends were arrested and tortured by the police in XXXX 2013. Both friends allegedly disappeared in XXXX 2013. The Appellant states that his house was raided by police in XXXX 2013, after which he was arrested and tortured while in police custody for two days. He was released upon payment of a bribe on condition that he appear at the police station in XXXX 2014 with his friends. The Appellant states that he moved to New Delhi to work with an agent to escape from India. He states that his brother was arrested and tortured by police who were looking for him, but was then released upon payment of a bribe. The Appellant then left India on or about XXXX XXXX, 2014, and travelled through various countries including the United States. The documents filed at the RPD by the Appellant (pp. 14-34 RPD record) show that the Appellant was arrested at or near Douglas, Arizona, on or about XXXX XXXX, 2014, and was issued a Notice to Appear at a removal hearing for being \"an alien present in the United States without being admitted or paroled, or who arrived in the United States at any time or place other than as designated by the Attorney General.\" These documents were not mentioned in the RPD decision so will not be addressed by the RAD. Following the Appellant's presumed release from custody in the United States, he arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2015.\nRemedy sought\n[5] The Appellant does not submit new evidence nor is a hearing before the RAD requested. The Appellant requests that the RAD either overturn the RPD decision and find the Appellant to be a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection or refer the matter back to the RPD for a new hearing before the RPD.\nROLE OF THE RAD\n[6] In the case of Huruglica1, followed by Yetna2 and Njeukam3, the Federal Court directed that the RAD approach its work as a \"hybrid\" type of appeal. According to Justice Phelan at paragraph 54, \"It (the RAD) must review all aspects of the RPD's decision and come to an independent assessment of whether the claimant is a Convention Refugee or a person in need of protection. Where its assessment departs from that of the RPD, the RAD must substitute its own decision.\" In paragraph 55, the Honourable Justice Phelan states that \"In conducting its assessment, it can recognize and respect the conclusion of the RPD on such issues as credibility and\/or where the RPD enjoys a particular advantage in reaching such a conclusion, but it is not restricted, as an appellate court is, to intervening on facts only where there is a \"palpable and overriding error\". Justice Phelan also notes at paragraph 38 that the RAD owes no deference to the RPD with respect to the RPD's assessment of country condition evidence.\n[7] In the decision of Spasoja4, Justice Roy concurs with the approach set out by Justice Phelan in Huruglica at paragraphs 12, 13, 24, and 25, with respect to the standard of review not being reasonableness and with respect to the RAD making an independent assessment of the evidence. However, at paragraph 39 of Spasoja, Justice Roy states that in his opinion, the RAD should intervene on questions of fact only where there is a palpable and overriding error.\n[8] In the decision of Alyafi5, Justice Martineau compares the currents of jurisprudence in the Federal Court and suggests that RAD members choose to follow either Spasoja or Huruglica until such time as we receive further direction from the Federal Court of Appeal. I choose to follow the reasoning of the Court in Huruglica.\n[9] In this decision, I have followed and will apply the reasoning in the Huruglica decision with respect to the issue of deference to the RPD in their assessment of credibility in this file. The RPD had the advantage of hearing the Appellant and investigated all matters of credibility thoroughly at the hearing.\nThe RPD Decision and the Appellant's Allegations\n[10] In a comprehensive decision of 52 paragraphs and ten pages, the RPD found the Appellant not credible about his allegations concerning his subjective fear. The RPD decision focuses on several points in the testimony where the Appellant contradicted himself, omitted to share key events from the Basis of Claim form, and continuously adjusted his testimony in response to open-ended questions. The RPD cited approximately seven separate contradictions or omissions on key points of evidence. The Appellant argues that the RPD committed errors in assessing the Appellant's credibility and that the reasons of the RPD are \"less convincing and even terse\". The Appellant raises two specific examples where it feels that errors were made which will be discussed below. (P. 16, Appellant's Argumentation (sic))\n[11] In the Appellant's Argumentation on page 16 of the Appellant's record, the Appellant specifically takes exception to two of these findings by the RPD - the timing of the application for a U.S. visa (paragraph 20, RPD decision) and the events of the second police raid (paragraph 42, RPD decision). The RAD will focus on these issues raised by the Appellant.\n[12] In the RPD decision at paragraphs 18-23, the issue of the timing of the application for a U.S. visa is discussed. Following extensive questioning by the member, the RPD concluded that the Appellant was not credible about his arrest and torture, as he initially stated that he was arrested XXXX XXXX, 2013, was tortured for two days, then hospitalized for a day and a night, after which he was recovering at home for ten or twenty days. (paragraph 18, RPD decision) The Appellant initially denied that he applied for a U.S. visa. However, when the Appellant was confronted with biometrics data from the United States that showed he was in New Delhi applying for a U.S. visa on XXXX XXXX, 2013 - six days following the alleged arrest - the Appellant's response was that he had rested for a few days at home and then the agent had taken him to New Delhi to apply for a U.S. visa. The RPD found that this contradiction undermined the Appellant's allegations of being arrested, imprisoned and tortured by the police in India. The Appellant's argument on this point is \"It doesn't mean that claimant had adjusted his answer to say that the agent took him to New Delhi to apply for his U.S. visa. Yes, the claimant had been taking bed-rest to recover from his injuries but meanwhile agent took him to New Delhi for his U.S. visa. In this given scenario, the claimant would have been awarded benefit of doubt. Instead of giving benefit of doubt, the panel does not accept claimant's explanations\". (p. 16, Appellant's Argumentation) The RAD does not accept this argument from the Appellant. In listening to the hearing, it is clear that the member's questions were open-ended and allowed the opportunity for the Appellant to be forthcoming about the timing to go to New Delhi for the U.S. visa. Not only was the Appellant not forthcoming about the U.S. visa application, he was explicit about the arrest, the torture, the hospitalization and the needed recovery time. It is completely inconsistent to omit the fact that rather than resting at home due to injury for ten to twenty days, he was actually travelling to New Delhi three days after his release from hospital. Furthermore, the RAD notes that in his written statement before the RPD the Appellant states: \"I was released on XXXX XXXX, 2013 with bribe of rupees 45,000\/... I was in bad shape and treated by a doctor...Upon recuperating, it was decided in the family to find a solution to my police's problem...On XXXX XXXX 2013, I made my mind that I must leave to save my life...\" It is contradictory to note in this statement that the Appellant acknowledges that he was in bad shape, received medical treatment, and upon recuperating says that he decided to leave India which he dates at XXXX XXXX, 2013, the day that he says he actually received the U.S. visa. However, according to his testimony, he would have travelled several hundred kilometers from his home ten days earlier, just after his release from hospital, to apply for the U.S. visa. The RPD analyzes these facts in the decision from paragraphs 27-31 and concludes that the Appellant is not credible. The RAD finds the combination of omissions and contradictions as described above undermines the Appellant's credibility about all of these events. The RAD would have come to the same conclusion as the RPD on the issue of the Appellant's credibility.\n[13] The second credibility finding challenged by the Appellant arises at paragraph 42 of the RPD decision relating to the Appellant's omission to mention police raids in XXXX 2014. To give some context, it may be useful to review an earlier line of questioning about the first two alleged police raids. Prior to the line of questioning about the alleged raids in XXXX 2014, the RPD had asked the Appellant to elaborate on the second alleged raid by the police on his home, while he was still living in India. (RPD decision, paragraphs 32-34) The first raid was when he was allegedly arrested on XXXX XXXX, 2013. The second raid was at some time afterwards while the Appellant was in hiding in India. The RPD asked the Appellant if anything happened during the second raid. The Appellant replied, on more than one occasion, that the police arrived at his house, searched for him and, not finding him, swore at his father and left. The RPD confronted the Appellant with the fact that the Appellant had not mentioned in his testimony the fact that his brother was arrested at the second raid. The Appellant replied that he had not mentioned his brother's arrest because the\nRPD member had not specifically asked him about his brother. The RPD had asked a series of open-ended questions, with respect to the events of the raid. The RAD finds that it is reasonable to expect that the Appellant would remember an event as traumatic as the arrest of his brother. The RPD found this omission undermined the Appellant's credibility. This issue was not raised by the Appellant, but the RAD raises it here because it leads into the issue which was raised by the Appellant.\n[14] The RPD asked the Appellant whether his family had encountered any other incidents with the police after the second police raid. The Appellant replied no, and then changed his testimony to say that, actually, the police had raided his family home two times in XXXX 2014. When the RPD member asked why these two additional raids were not in his Basis of Claim form, the Appellant's response was that he forgot. (RPD decision, paragraph 42). In response to this finding, the Appellant argues at p. 16 of Appellant's Argumentation: \"By saying that the claimant forgot to mention police raid does not lead to conclude that the claimant adjusted his testimony. The claimant is a human being and for this very reason, the claimant forgot to mention in his BOC form\". The RAD does not accept this argument from the Appellant as it is a major omission of two recent police raids that were not included in the written Basis of Claim form. The Basis of Claim form is filled out after reflection. It is understood and expected that claimants may make minor errors as to dates or times, or spelling mistakes, but it is not credible for an Appellant to forget and omit a major part of his testimony that would suggest a continued police search for him three months after he had left India. The RAD does not find this to be a minor issue and finds that the Appellant's credibility is undermined about the two police raids in XXXX 2014.\nREMEDIES\n[15] For all these reasons, the Tribunal confirms the determination of the RPD that the Appellant, Mr. XXXX XXXX is neither a \"Convention refugee\" pursuant to s. 96 of the Act, nor a \"person in need of protection\" pursuant to s. 97 of the Act.\nCONCLUSION\n[16] The appeal is dismissed.\nDiane Sokolyk\nMe Diane Sokolyk\nJanuary 25, 2016\nDate\n\/cos\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD.25.02 (2014.09.11)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\nRAD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SAR : MB5-04827\n6\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX, his wife, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX their minor son, XXXX XXXX XXXX, as well as XXXX XXXX XXXX adult son, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, are citizens of Mexico. XXXX XXXX XXXX is the designated representative of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX allegedly left Mexico on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017. His wife and their minor son allegedly left on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017.\n[2] The murder of his brother and his mother, assaults committed by the authorities, and death threats from members of a criminal group prompted them to move. They finally left Mexico and came to Canada, fearing that a policy change would have the effect of revoking the visas of Mexicans.\n[3] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) determined that XXXX XXXX XXXX is not a refugee within the meaning of the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (the Convention) or a person in need of protection, because he was not credible. Its finding was based on the following:\n- His failure to seek state protection or file a complaint regarding the threats received\n- The contradiction between the authorities' ineptitude and the fact that his brother's murderer was arrested and imprisoned\n- Forgetting to mention, in his testimony, where he had received treatment after he was assaulted by the authorities, the absence of his medical evidence and its omission from his account\n- His failure to ask for assistance from a lawyer friend who works for the public ministry\n- The fact that he moved and lived unhindered for six years in the state of Guerrero\n- His failure to mention in his account that he had continued to make inquiries with the police about his mother's murder\n- His inconsistent behaviour in returning to Acapulco, where he feared for his life because he was threatened, despite knowing that he was still threatened\n[4] He is appealing the decision rendered by the RPD on November 26, 2018, alleging that the RPD erred as follows:\n- The newspaper articles filed in evidence contain dates of publication and refer to the dates of the events they recount.\n- It noted that XXXX XXXX XXXX did not seek state protection; however, he did seek state protection in the state of Guerrero and it was refused.\nDETERMINATION OF THE APPEAL\n[5] Pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) dismisses the appeal and confirms the RPD's determination that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\nROLE OF THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION\n[6] The RAD reviews RPD decisions after carrying out its own analysis of the record, applying the correctness standard of review.1 The exception to this rule arises in situations where the RPD enjoyed a meaningful advantage, in which case the RAD may show deference.2\n[7] I will apply the correctness standard of review and carry out an independent analysis of the record, including reviewing all the evidence and listening to the recording.\nNEW EVIDENCE\n[8] XXXX XXXX XXXX submitted the following new evidence on appeal:\n- A medical report dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2006\n- Parole order of XXXX XXXX XXXX, dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018\n[9] The evidence submitted by XXXX XXXX XXXX did not arise after November 26, 2018, the date on which the refugee protection claim was rejected. His medical report dates back to XXXX 2006, and the parole order, to XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018. They were reasonably available. Given the nature of the documents, it is not inconceivable to expect these documents to have been submitted when the claim was made. I cannot accept them.\nANALYSIS\n[10] A number of the elements at the heart of the RPD's determination are not being disputed on appeal. I will examine those that were submitted as part of the appeal memorandum. I consider the others to be correct.\n[11] The determinative issue is credibility.\n[12] According to XXXX XXXX XXXX testimony and account:\n- Men came to his mother's restaurant, looking for his brother XXXX in XXXX 2002.\n- His brother was kidnapped and killed two days later.\n- The family received death threats for a year.\n- In XXXX 2004, some people killed his mother.\n- In XXXX 2004, he was kidnapped and assaulted by police officers.\n- He relocated to the state of Sonora, where he held various jobs for eight years.\n- In 2007, his other brother disappeared without a trace after leaving for Jalisco.\n- In 2012, two individuals in a vehicle with Guerrero licence plates came to his home and asked his wife about him.\n- He immediately fled to Cancun, in the state of Quintana Roo, and was able to work for four years without any trouble.\n- He got wind of continuing threats against him and, in spite of this, accepted an invitation from a colleague who had told him of the danger precisely where there was danger.\n- After the colleague in question was killed, the appellant and his family moved to XXXX, five hours away from Cancun, where he worked as a XXXX.\n[13] The RPD concluded that XXXX XXXX XXXX had not sought state protection or utilized legal support available to him.\n[14] The memorandum alleges that the RPD erred, as the account mentions the family's fruitless attempts to obtain police assistance.\n[15] The RPD asked XXXX XXXX XXXX for examples of instances when his family had approached the police authorities. He was unable to provide any evidence of complaints submitted. Moreover, he explained that he did not have such evidence in hand, since he had been threatened and wanted to avoid trouble. He further testified that additional or alternative efforts were not made given that the authorities had allegedly refused them. Once again, because they did not want trouble.\n[16] It seems paradoxical that XXXX XXXX XXXX family was threatened for making a complaint, but that they do not have copies of the complaints they were threatened because of. After being refused protection, they took no additional steps. This is even more intriguing since they had at least one contact within the public ministry, which would have helped XXXX XXXX XXXX obtain protection. Finally, it makes no sense that, after being met with numerous refusals from the authorities, one year later they would simply take the same steps that had previously failed.\n[17] The RPD's conclusion that XXXX XXXX XXXX did not approach the state in the wake of the incidents he suffered is correct. The finding that this undermines his credibility is also correct.\n[18] The RPD considered that the arrest and conviction of his mother's killer was an example of state intervention to protect its citizens and reinforced its finding that XXXX XXXX XXXX credibility had been undermined.\n[19] On appeal, it was submitted that the murderer had been paroled and that this demonstrates the shortcomings of the protection offered to XXXX XXXX XXXX. Although the evidence submitted has been rejected, it should be noted that the outcome of a criminal case following conviction, owing to appeals or the parole process, cannot be used to draw conclusions regarding the viability of existing protection.\n[20] The RPD's credibility findings are based, among other things, on the evidence of XXXX XXXX XXXX actions, some of which make no sense, and on prolonged periods of calm.\n[21] The arguments raised on appeal are insufficient to overturn the RPD's correct conclusions, which are based on numerous findings, omissions and contradictions put forward to XXXX XXXX XXXX.\nCONCLUSION\n[22] Pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the IRPA, the RAD dismisses the appeal and confirms the RPD's determination that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n(signed)\nRichard Sheitoyan\nMe Richard Sheitoyan\nDecember 17, 2019\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD File No. \/ No de dossier de la SAR : MB8-26706\nMB8-26707 \/ MB8-26708 \/ MB8-26709\nRAD.25.02 (April 4, 2019)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n7\nImmigration and\nRefugee Board of Canada\nRefugee Appeal Division\nCommission de l'immigration\net du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 du Canada\nSection d'appel des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s\nRAD.25.02 (April 4, 2019)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] Mr. XXXX, you state that you are a Rwandan citizen and that the authorities detained and threatened you in order to force you to perjure yourself and give false testimony in order to incriminate a couple who owned XXXX XXXX; the husband in this couple was already XXXX XXXX1\n[2] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) concluded that you had not established your identity. It also found that you were not credible with regard to your refugee protection claim, as your testimony contained inconsistencies and your allegations were implausible.2\n[3] On appeal, you have requested an oral hearing because of the errors made by the RPD, arguing that it erred in its assessment of your identity.3 You have also presented a document concerning your birth certificate.4\n[4] After conducting my own analysis of your record, I conclude that the evidence you have presented in your appeal is not admissible (I), that there is no cause to hold an oral hearing (II), and that the RPD did not err as you allege in analyzing your identity (III).\n[5] In the paragraphs below, I will explain my reasons. Given my conclusions, your appeal is dismissed.\nI. EVIDENCE PRESENTED IN YOUR APPEAL\n[6] Rule 29 of the Refugee Appeal Division Rules (RAD Rules) states that if an appellant wants to use a document or provide written submissions that were not provided with the appeal record, the appellant must make an application to the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) in accordance with rule 37.5 Such documents may not be used without the RAD's authorization.\n[7] Subrule 29(4) of the RAD Rules stipulates that, in deciding whether to allow an application, the RAD must consider any relevant factors, including the document's relevance and probative value, any new evidence the document brings to the appeal, and whether the person who is the subject of the appeal, with reasonable effort, could have provided the document or written submissions with their record.\n[8] In his letter of March 7, 2019, your lawyer informed the RAD that he had just received new evidence from you. He added that it was relevant because it indicated that authorities of the city of Kigali, in the district of Kagarama, had made a mistake when the certified copy of your original birth certificate was signed. He asked the RAD to allow this evidence, which could not have been presented sooner.6\n[9] I read the letter dated January 25, 2019, which was signed by a civil status officer in the district of Kagarama. According to the letter, a civil status officer made a mistake when signing the certified copy of your original birth certificate. The letter also states that the current authorities have now corrected the error and thereby issued your birth certificate, legally and in due form, with the required explanations.7\n[10] First, you did not request authorization to use the letter dated January 25, 2019, in accordance with rules 29 and 37 of the RAD Rules.\n[11] Second, although the letter states that your birth certificate was issued to you in due form, it appears that you have not provided this new version of your birth certificate to the RAD.\n[12] Third, the issue of your identity was identified as a determinative issue during the first session of your RPD hearing on September 27, 2016.8 At that time, you stated that you had obtained an attestation of birth a long time ago.9 Following the first session of your hearing, you filed that attestation of birth in evidence.10 You also filed a birth certificate11 and a certified copy of that birth certificate.12 During the second session of your hearing, you were questioned at length about these documents.13 At one point, the RPD confronted you about the fact that the certified copy of your birth certificate did not contain the signatures of the parties who appeared or the witnesses. You had no explanation for this.14\n[13] In my opinion, the sole purpose of the letter of January 25, 2019, is to correct an error that was identified by the RPD during the second session of your hearing. I find that it has no probative value. Moreover, you have not demonstrated that you made the necessary effort to provide the letter with your appeal record. After reviewing all of the relevant factors, as required by rule 29 of the RAD Rules, I conclude that there is no cause to allow this letter to be used in your appeal.\nII. ORAL HEARING BEFORE THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION\n[14] In your written statement, you request an oral hearing under subsection 110(6) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) because of the errors made by the RPD.15\n[15] It is the RAD's responsibility to determine whether the criteria set out in subsection 110(6) have been met.16 One of the criteria set out in this subsection is that evidence presented on appeal must have been deemed admissible. However, I have concluded that the evidence you have submitted in your appeal is not admissible. Therefore, it is not new evidence. Therefore, there is no cause to hold an oral hearing.17\nIII. ANALYSIS OF THE APPEAL\n[16] The RAD's role is not to carry out a de novo consideration of refugee protection claims, but to determine whether the RPD erred as alleged.18 I have conducted an independent analysis of the record to form my own conclusions,19 notably by reviewing the transcript of the RPD hearing20 and the documentary evidence. I conclude that the correctness standard must be applied.21 In the following paragraphs, I will explain why, in my opinion, the RPD did not err as you allege.22\n[17] In your memorandum, you argue that the RPD refused to acknowledge that you had established your identity, primarily by not giving them any probative value. You also argue that, with that mindset, the RPD concluded that your birth certificate and the certified copy of it were not genuine and had been fabricated for the purpose of your refugee protection claim-a harsh, unfair and arbitrary conclusion, given that it was not based on an expert analysis.23\n[18] In its decision, the RPD analyzed in detail the issue of whether or not you had established your identity.24 I have carefully reviewed that decision, the transcript of the first and second sessions of the hearing, and the documents you filed in evidence before the RPD. Based on my own analysis of your record, the RPD's conclusions are based on your testimony and the documents you filed in evidence before it.\n[19] It is well established that \"where the RPD is satisfied one or more of an applicant's identity documents have been fraudulently obtained or are otherwise inauthentic, the presumption that the applicant's remaining identity documents are valid can no longer be maintained.\"25\n[20] That said, although the RPD may set aside the presumption of the validity of documents presented to it to establish a claimant's identity, it must still consider and assess the authenticity and probative value of each document and give the claimant an opportunity to address its concerns.26 In your case, the RPD took care to consider and assess each document in evidence before it and gave you an opportunity to respond to its concerns. Therefore, it did not err.\n[21] Based on my own assessment of your case, your argument that the RPD erred with respect to your identity are unfounded. The RPD did not refuse to acknowledge your identity. On the contrary, it conducted a thorough assessment of your testimony and the documents in evidence before it. Therefore, in my opinion, it did not err in concluding that, on a balance of probabilities, you did not establish your identity.\n[22] As your identity was not established, there was no need to continue the analysis of your account or your allegations concerning your fear of persecution or a risk to your life.27\nCONCLUSION\n[23] For these reasons, I confirm the RPD's determination, namely, that you failed to establish your identity and that, as a result, you are neither a refugee under section 96 nor a person in need of protection under section 97 of the IRPA.\n[24] Your appeal is dismissed.\n(Signed)\nAlain Bissonnette\nMe Alain Bissonnette\nAugust 28, 2020\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\nKanawati v.

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] This is the appeal filed by XXXX XXXX, a citizen of the Kingdom of Morocco, regarding a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rendered on January 7, 2019, rejecting his claim for refugee protection.\n[2] These are the main issues that were noted in a Basis of Claim Form (BOC Form), and later amended before the start of the hearing.1 The appellant states that he fears for his life should he return to Morocco. He notes that since 2011, he has faced death threats, abductions and attacks from individuals who would go see him and threaten him at school. He submits that he was the target of assaults in 2011 and that he was injured and had to go to the hospital. He states that his family had to move several times, without knowing why or by whom they were being pursued; in 2011, they found out that his father, [translation] \"as part of his role as a XXXX, had convicted certain people. They were well positioned and against the government in power, including a person who is a judge in office and is part of the mafia (terrorist and drugs),\" which explained the death threats received. He states that he filed a complaint with the police and that his mother did the same with the Centre marocain des droits de l'homme [Moroccan centre for human rights], but to no avail. He then had a very hard time finding employment and lived in an unstable manner in various cities. He left Morocco for Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2015, with a Canadian visa issued on January 2, 2015. On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017, the appellant was arrested by the Montr\u00e9al police and was held at the Laval detention centre, at which time he filed a claim for refugee protection.\n[3] The Minister's representative intervened at the hearing before the RPD by filing documents in a notice of intervention2 regarding the appellant's credibility.\n[4] The RPD rejected the appellant's refugee protection claim because it found that there was a problem and a lack of credibility.\n[5] On appeal, the appellant submits the following arguments:\n1. [translation] \"The panel did not ask the appellant why he did not want to disclose the name [of the judge] in his BOC Form;\" he feared that an investigation would have consequences for his mother.\n2. [translation] \"The appellant completed his BOC Form while in custody...he is not proficient in French...and he has a very low education level,\" which explains certain omissions-like that regarding the assault of February 2011-which were rectified in his amended BOC Form; and he got the name of the hospital wrong due to the stress of the circumstances.\n3. [translation] \"It was only when he was arrested by Immigration Canada and during an interview with an immigration officer that the appellant learned that, due to his problems in Morocco, he could claim refugee protection, which he did.\"\n4. [translation] \"The appellant and his mother decided to file [the complaint with the Moroccan Centre for Human Rights], even without disclosing the judge's name, in an effort to document their case should a future opportunity arise and allow them to reveal the judge's name.\"\n5. [translation] \"The appellant did not allege to be a fervent political opponent, just that he had views against the Moroccan government, which he considers corrupt and unjust. ... This type of behaviour can cause problems for him in Morocco. ... The panel erred in setting aside this allegation made by the appellant simply because it did not believe the appellant's other allegations.\"\n[6] The appellant is asking the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) [translation] \"to allow this appeal of the RPD's decision; to order an oral hearing before deciding this appeal or to set aside the RPD's determination....\"\n[7] The appellant is not asking to present new evidence pursuant to subsection 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act3 (IRPA) and he is requesting that an oral hearing be held under subsection 110(6) of the IRPA, as written in the conclusions of the memorandum.\n[8] The Minister's representative did not intervene on appeal.\nDETERMINATION\n[9] Pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the IRPA, the RAD confirms the RPD's determination that XXXX XXXX is neither a \"Convention refugee\" nor a \"person in need of protection\" within the meaning of sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA.\n[10] The appeal is dismissed.\nSCOPE OF THE APPEAL\n[11] For questions of fact and law and questions of mixed fact and law, the RAD must apply the correctness standard in accordance with Huruglica.4\n[12] I conducted an independent analysis of all the evidence on the record, after listening carefully to the hearing, in order to form my own opinion on this refugee protection claim and determine whether the decision rendered by the RPD is correct.\nORAL HEARING BEFORE THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION\n[13] The appellant is requesting that the RAD hold an oral hearing under subsection 110(6) of the IRPA. Subsection 110(6) of the IRPA provides that the RAD may hold an oral hearing if, in its opinion, there is new admissible evidence that meets the three conditions set out therein.5 In this case, I find that there is no cause to hold an oral hearing as no new evidence was submitted and accepted and, consequently, found to be admissible under subsection 110(4) of the IRPA.\n[14] For these reasons, the request to hold an oral hearing before the RAD is rejected.\nANALYSIS\n[15] Having reviewed all of the evidence on the record, both testimonial and documentary, the RAD makes the same finding as the RPD, that the appellant is not credible.\n[16] The appellant argues that the RPD did not properly assess his credibility and that the impact on the decision is such that the appellant would not be persecuted in his country.\n[17] The appellant's credibility is the determinative issue in this case. The RAD would like to mention that the appellant did not directly answer the questions he was asked. Despite the instructions provided at the start of the hearing to listen carefully to the questions and answer them clearly, and to ask for them to be repeated as necessary, the RPD heard statements that did not correspond to the questions put forth. For example, the member asked him where he lived between February 2011 and July 2012, to which he responded: I abandoned my studies. Another example is the process for the Canadian visa and the documents to provide. The appellant's response was as follows: call to a person. Who? A person I worked with; he helped me. Who is he? I don't know his name. He gave me the documents and started the process. It was all nebulous, with no details or clear information. This significantly undermines his credibility and his case.\n[18] The first topic addressed in the memorandum pertains to the name of the judge, who is not identified in his written account, and he adds that he feared an investigation concerning his mother. The RPD raised the fact that the main agent of persecution in this case is not identified in his BOC Form or in the amendment he provided. What does his testimony reveal?\n[19] The RAD listened carefully to the recording and listened again to the part about the identity of the individual who allegedly threatened him. With regard to this claim that there could be consequences for his mother, the RAD did not hear this assertion from the appellant. The first-instance member properly assessed and addressed the topic regarding the person threatening the appellant. Given that there are two written accounts submitted in support of his refugee protection claim, the member rightfully requested that the appellant explain why the agent of persecution had not been identified. The first written account notes that he feared a person. In the amended account, he corrected it to state a person who is a judge in office. The answer provided was at first, I said a judge. His counsel intervened to ask the appellant to respond to the panel's question. The appellant answered: I did not see the value of putting the name. In response to his answer, the member raised the issue again about this obvious lack of a main player in this case, to which the appellant responded: I said that he worked for the government and the court. The information in the account states: My persecutors were powerful people who worked for the police and the corrupt government.\n[20] The panel notes a significant discrepancy between the written accounts submitted and the testimony heard. In addition, despite the appellant's allegations, the first written account does not mention that a judge is the agent of persecution; in the amended written account, he refers to a judge in office, and at the hearing he provided the name of a judge he claimed to fear. He testified that he did not want to provide the judge's name in his two written accounts. On reading the basic written account, one might believe that the appellant fears people with ties to the mafia, drugs and terrorism. The story switches in the amendment, and it is at this point that he includes a new player, namely, a judge in office with ties to the mafia.\n[21] The RAD is of the opinion that the appellant should have mentioned from the outset that he feared XXXX XXXX (ph), heard at the hearing, rather than dithering in his two accounts which are, on the whole, rather flawed and incomplete. The absence of the persecutor's name in both written accounts filed significantly undermines his credibility.\n[22] Consequently, the RAD is of the opinion that the RPD did not err in this regard.\n[23] The second topic addressed in the memorandum concerns the BOC Form that was completed while he was in custody. He states that he is not proficient in French and that his education level is very low, which would explain certain omissions and contradictions attributable to stress.\n[24] The fact that he is not proficient in French is not a factor to consider as it is understood that he used interpreter services to complete his BOC Form. Furthermore, during the hearing, the appellant sometimes began answering without waiting for the translation from the interpreter in the room. Moreover, in the IMM 5669, Schedule A6 document, at question 7 on education, the appellant reports that he had 15 years of school. This conflicts with the allegation that he has a very low education level. Despite these assertions, the RAD notes that the appellant made major errors in his initial written account.\n[25] His brief written account submitted includes many amendments, including the date of his father's death, a date change regarding the threats, the addition of an assault and lastly, the filing of a complaint with the Centre marocain des droits de l'homme. All of this relevant information should have been found in the initial written account, which suggests an oversight on his part. He referred to an error between the 1 or the 7 in the writing of the date of his father's death; the RAD cannot accept that response since the appellant was accompanied by his counsel and a person interpreted the content of his information form for him. In addition to this error regarding the date of his father's death, it is the alleged assault against him in 2011 that resulted in injuries requiring a hospital visit, which was not mentioned in the initial written account. This is significant. Moreover, it suffices to state that the appellant never shared with the panel the date of his assault. He only stated February 2011 and never mentioned the treatment received at the hospital. This significantly undermines his credibility.\n[26] The third point mentioned in the memorandum pertains to when the appellant learned that he could claim refugee protection. He states that it was only when he was arrested by Immigration Canada that he found out he could claim refugee protection. The RPD noted that he waited more than two years before claiming protection, at which time he was illegal.\n[27] At this stage of the analysis, a chronology of events is relevant. The appellant obtained his passport on November 4, 2014. He stated that this was a second residency document. A Canadian visa was issued on January 2, 2015. It is known that a visa is valid for six months. He arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2015, which means that his stay expired on July 31, 2015. He was subsequently illegal in Canada. He was arrested for intoxication on XXXX XXXX, 2017, by the Montr\u00e9al police, and after a check was conducted, he was taken to the Laval detention centre.\n[28] In addition to the fact that he did not submit an application to regularize or extend this visitor status, he testified that he did not know anything about the refugee protection process. Someone allegedly told him that if he got married, it would help his case. In all these years, he did not consult a counsel. When asked to mention when and how he knew he could claim refugee protection, the appellant testified that an immigration officer at the Laval detention centre had told him about this possibility.\n[29] A document filed by the Minister's representative7 mentions an interview with the appellant. The panel has cited an excerpt from this interview: \"He says his parents are dead and he has no home or job in Morocco. He says he wants to stay here and get a job and his residence but has done nothing in the past 2+ years. He then asks if he could claim asylum.\"\n[30] Contrary to his testimony, the appellant told the immigration officer that he wanted to seek protection in Canada. When asked about his statement reported in Exhibit M-4, he testified: I was scared, I told him, he told me that you can claim refugee protection; yes, I knew that. Disagreeing with these statements, the first-instance member asked him why he had waited more than two years to be arrested by the police, if he was aware of the refugee protection concept. He stated that he had no idea. This undermines the credibility of his testimony.\n[31] The RAD is of the opinion that the appellant was negligent because, since his arrival and in the period when he was illegal in Canada, he did not consult a counsel or gather information from anyone other than general information, as he put it. If the appellant had not been arrested by the police authorities, he would still be on the run. It was only when confronted by the authorities that he took steps to regularize his status in Canada.\n[32] As a result, the RAD is of the opinion that the RPD did not err in its assessment of this matter.\n[33] The fourth factor concerns the complaint with the Centre marocain des droits de l'homme. The appellant and his mother decided to file a complaint without disclosing the name of the judge, in order to document their case. The RPD noted a contradiction about this complaint, namely, that the appellant had been assaulted and threatened by strangers rather than by a judge.\n[34] The appellant stated that it was his mother who filed the complaint in August 2011.8 She reports in the document that her son [translation] \"was constantly beaten, assaulted and threatened by strangers and that there was a score to settle.\" It is paradoxical, to say the least, that the judge in question and his associates are not named in the text, which would give more weight to the complaint. The appellant testified that if his mother had mentioned the judge's name, the authorities would not have received the complaint. This statement is not supported by any of the documentary evidence. Furthermore, what good is reporting a situation if the authorities are not properly informed. The complaint as submitted is, to say the least, neutral and without information that could lead to an investigation and potential arrests.\n[35] The content of the complaint contradicts the appellant's testimony and written accounts that he suffered a single assault in 2011. When asked to explain this apparent contradiction, the appellant responded that he had focused on the assault from 2011. In addition to correcting his written account by indicating the date of the assault as 2011, it is understood through his testimony that he had been assaulted and threatened with death many times during his life. This, once again at the end of the hearing, adds an amendment to the written accounts. This text adds nothing new to the written account, but rather adds fog and confusion to the written accounts and his testimony. The RAD draws a negative inference from this document and the appellant's testimony.\n[36] The final point in the memorandum involves the appellant's behaviour and his ideas against the government, which he considers to be corrupt. The RPD mentioned that the appellant's allegation that he is subjected to a risk by reason of his anti-government political opinion has no weight given the member's non-credibility finding in this case.\n[37] The appellant noted in his written accounts that the government is corrupt and he no longer feels safe. His complaint was pointless and unsuccessful. This led him to oppose the government and the kingdom and to ultimately leave the country. His testimony mentions little about his views or his anti-government beliefs. When asked about his beliefs or objections to the state, he claimed the following: the fact that you file a complaint against someone means that you become an opponent. This was the only explanation offered to the panel in support of his political opinion against the state. The RAD finds that his explanations are very brief and that his views are pusillanimous.\n[38] The panel finds that if the state has set up an organization like the Centre marocain des droits de l'homme, it is certainly not to go after individuals who have filed complaints.\n[39] Accordingly, the RAD is of the opinion that the RPD did not err in its assessment of this matter.\n[40] For the reasons set out in this decision, the RAD is of the opinion that the RPD made the correct decision.\nREMEDY\n[41] In light of all the facts noted above and after reviewing all the evidence, the RAD for these reasons confirms the RPD's determination, namely, that XXXX XXXX is neither a \"Convention refugee\" under section 96 of the IRPA nor a \"person in need of protection\" within the meaning of section 97 of the IRPA.\n[42] The appeal is dismissed.\n(signed)\nMichel Jobin\nMe Michel Jobin\nSeptember 2, 2020\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD File No. \/ No de dossier de la SAR : MB9-03283\nRAD.25.02 (January 2020)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\nImmigration and Refugee\nBoard of Canada\nRefugee Appeal Division\nCommission de l'immigration\net du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 du Canada\nSection d'appel des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s\nRAD.25.02 (January 2020)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] XXXX XXXX (the Appellant), a citizen of Hungary, appealed a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD), dated June 26, 2018, rejecting his claim for refugee protection. The Appellant requests that the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) allow the appeal and find him to be a Convention refugee or person in need of protection. In the alternative, the Appellant requests that the RAD refer the matter back to a different member of the RPD for redetermination.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] The appeal is allowed. Pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(c) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), the RAD refers the matter to the RPD for redetermination by a differently constituted panel.\nBACKGROUND\n[3] The Appellant is a citizen of Hungary and alleges to be a homosexual of Roma ethnicity. He alleges that he faced discrimination at places of employment, restaurants, clubs, and he also received improper medical treatment by physicians. He also alleges that he was assaulted due to his sexual orientation, and the police did nothing when it was reported to police. The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration (the Minister) intervened and alleged that the Appellant is excluded from protection, pursuant to article 1F(b) of the refugee Convention for serious non-political crime.\n[4] The RPD determined that the Minister had not established the burden to demonstrate exclusion because the seriousness of the crime in Hungary had not been established. The RPD also determined that the Appellant had not credibly established his sexual orientation and that the credibility findings with regard to his sexual orientation extended to the events which he alleged occurred to him as a Roma man. Finally, while the RPD accepted that the Appellant is Roma, the RPD found that state protection applied with regard to the Appellant's general profile.\n[5] The Appellant alleges the following errors:\n(a) The RPD erred in assessing the Appellant's sexual orientation;\n(b) The RPD erred by extending the credibility findings about the Appellant's sexual orientation to the allegations about his problems as a Roma;\n(c) The RPD failed to conduct an assessment of cumulative discrimination amounting to persecution;\n(d) The RPD erred in assessing state protection because the assessment is tainted by the negative credibility findings; and\n(e) The RPD erred by failing to assess section 97.\n[6] The Appellant submitted one piece of new evidence. However, as I am returning this matter to the RPD, I am not assessing the admissibility of this evidence, as the issue is moot.\n[7] The Minister intervened on appeal and, while the Minister did not challenge the finding that exclusion had not been established, the Minister argued that the RPD's decision should be upheld for the following reasons;\n(a) Deference should be given to the RPD's credibility findings, which are properly made;\n(b) The state protection analysis is correct because the credibility findings are properly made;\n(c) State protection applies to the section 97 analysis; and\n(d) The Appellant's criminality in Canada undermines his claim.\nANALYSIS\n[8] The following issues are determinative of this appeal:\n(a) The RPD erred in extending the credibility findings about the Appellant's sexual orientation to the allegations about his problems as a Roma;\n(b) The RPD's credibility determination impacted the assessment of state protection; and\n(c) The matter must be returned to the RPD.\nThe RPD erred in extending the credibility findings about the Appellant's sexual orientation to the allegations about his problems as a Roma\n[9] The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in its assessment of his credibility generally and that it was also an error to extend the negative credibility findings about his sexual orientation to his allegations about his problems as a Roma. The Minister argues that deference should be given to the RPD's credibility findings, which are properly made. I agree with the Appellant that the RPD erred in finding that the credibility issues with the sexual orientation issues extended to the allegations of problems that the Appellant had as a Roma.\n[10] In making this finding, it is unnecessary for me to confirm or overturn the RPD's findings on the Appellant's sexual orientation. I find the error to be in treating the two relatively distinct issues as connected and finding that credibility concerns about the Appellant's same-sex relationships extended to allegations that he had problems as a Roma man.\n[11] I find that the Guney case highlighted by the Appellant is on point.1 In Guney, the Federal Court found that the RPD erred by disbelieving the entirety of a claim based on two different grounds where one ground was found not to be credible.2 The same error was made here. Accordingly, the RPD's finding that the problems with the credibility of the Appellant's sexual orientation \"undermines the credibility of his material allegations of a forward-looking risk of harm based on his Roma ethnicity\"3 cannot be sustained.\nThe RPD's credibility determination impacted the assessment of state protection\n[12] The Appellants argue that the RPD's credibility determination impacted the assessment of state protection. The Minister, on the other hand, argues that there was no problem with the state protection analysis because the RPD based its findings on the Appellant's personal circumstances.4 I am not persuaded by the Minister's argument.\n[13] The RPD acknowledges that the particular circumstances of an appellant must be considered in a state protection assessment, but in this case, the only personal circumstances the RPD accepted were that the Appellant was Roma and had been employed in some manner and had some healthcare. As the RPD found the Appellant's allegations were not credible, the RPD did not consider whether the Appellant's past experiences impacted on his ability to access state protection. This is necessarily true because the RPD did not accept these experiences as credible.\n[14] As I have found the RPD's approach to credibility to be incorrect, I also find that this approach to state protection cannot be sustained.\nThe matter must be returned to the RPD\n[15] Having found that the RPD's decision is wrong, I turned my mind to whether I could decide to confirm the determination of the RPD or substitute a positive determination. For the following reasons, I cannot.\n[16] I considered whether I could make an independent decision about the credibility of the Appellant's allegations of issues as a Roma man. If I was able to make a negative determination on this issue, I could possibly confirm the RPD's decision. If I was able to make a positive credibility determination, I could have possibly substituted a positive decision. Reviewing the record, I find that there is insufficient evidence on the record for me to make an independent decision about the credibility of the Appellant's allegations of issues as a Roma man. The Appellant alleged incidents of harassment by anti-Roma extremists, which were not explored at the RPD hearing.5 Furthermore, only limited questions were asked about an allegation of medical discrimination.6 Without hearing oral evidence about this, I cannot determine whether the Appellant's allegations of discrimination and persecution as a Roma are credible. Therefore, I cannot confirm the RPD's decision or substitute a different decision, as this assessment must be done.\nCONCLUSION AND DIRECTIONS\n[17] For the reasons given above, the appeal is allowed. Pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(c) of the IRPA, the RAD refers the matter to the RPD for redetermination by a differently constituted panel.\n[18] The RPD is directed to consider all of the evidence on the record and determine the issues, including the credibility of the Appellant's allegations of past discrimination and persecution as a Roma man.\n(signed)\n\"E.

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX (Principal Appellant) and XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, (Associate Appellants), citizens of Jordan, appealed a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD), dated October 9, 2018, rejecting their claims for refugee protection. XXXX XXXX, a third daughter of the adult Appellants, who was a minor associate claimant before the RPD, is a citizen of the USA. She made no claim against the USA before the RPD and is not named as an associate Appellant in this appeal.1\nDETERMINATION\n[2] The RAD dismisses the appeal and confirms the decision of the RPD that the Appellants are neither a Convention2 refugee nor a person in need of protection, pursuant to section 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).3\nBACKGROUND\n[3] The Appellants are a Sunni family from Jordan consisting of the husband, wife and three minor children. As noted above, the minor child XXXX, was born in the USA when the family lived there in 2016. The Appellants were living in Norway between 2012 and 2014 as refugee applicants when the Principal Appellant took an interest in the Shia faith. The family decided to return to Jordan in 2015. Their refugee claims were rejected in Norway. The principal Appellant was kidnapped and held for several days in Jordan when at a Shia shrine in Jordan. Fearing further harm from other Sunni religious activists and his own family because of his religious conversion, the principal Appellant fled to the USA and the associate Appellants joined him later in 2016. The family remained in the USA until coming to Canada and making refugee claims in 2017. Their claims were rejected by the RPD on October 28, 2018.\nRPD Findings\n[4] The RPD did not find the Appellants' evidence, including the religious conversion of the principal Appellant, to be credible. The RPD panel also found that the Appellants had not established a sur place claim in Canada.\nAppellants' Arguments\n[5] The Appellants argue that the RPD failed to consider the totality of the evidence and breached procedural fairness by not calling a witness at the hearing. The Appellants also argue they were represented before the RPD by incompetent counsel.\n[6] The Appellants' counsel asks that I consider the audio tape of the hearing as new evidence on appeal. The audio tape as well as the transcript of the proceedings are part of the record and while I will consider them I do not accept them as new evidence pursuant to section 110(4) of IRPA. The Appellants have submitted no new evidence under section 110(4) and there is no reason for me to consider conducting an oral hearing under section 110(6) of IRPA.\nANALYSIS\n[7] With respect to questions of fact and mixed fact and law, I have applied the standard of correctness as per Huruglica.4 When reviewing the RPD decision, I am required to independently determine whether the RPD was correct in relation to each alleged error of law,\nfact or mixed fact and law. I may defer to the RPD's credibility assessment of oral testimony if I find that the RPD had a meaningful advantage in the circumstances. Reasons will be provided in my analysis if I find that the RPD had a meaningful advantage.\n[8] It is the persons claiming refugee protection and not the RPD or the RAD that bears the onus of establishing the need for refugee protection. It is the responsibility of the RPD or the\nRAD to consider the applicable case law and weigh the documentary and testimonial evidence and to draw conclusions as to whether the evidence is sufficient to establish the Appellants' allegations.\nWas there a breach of procedural fairness?\n[9] The Appellants' current counsel argues that the Appellants' former counsel acted incompetently before the RPD by amending the Appellants' Basis of Claim (BOC) form at the outset of the hearing. The Appellants' current counsel further argues that there was a breach of procedural fairness because former counsel was provided an opportunity to meet with the Principal Appellant off the record to make BOC corrections and because the Member discussed procedural issues with the Appellants' former counsel in English (which was later summarized in Arabic) by the RPD panel through an interpreter.\n[10] The Appellants' current counsel also argues that the RPD panel breached procedural fairness because it did not permit the Appellants to call a witness.5\n[11] The Appellants' current counsel also appears to argue that it was inappropriate for the RPD panel to examine the Appellants in regard to inconsistencies between their BOC and other testimony.6\n[12] The Appellant's current counsel argues that there was a break in the audio tape which constitutes a breach in procedural fairness.7\n[13] The IRB Practice Notice on Allegations against Former Counsel (\"Practice Notice\") from the Board has not been followed by the Appellant's current counsel in this case.8 A key element in the Practice Notice is the requirement of the Appellants to provide \"a signed authorization releasing any privilege, including solicitor-client privilege, to the extent necessary to allow former counsel to respond to the allegations.\" According to the Practice Notice, and existing jurisprudence, it is required that former counsel be given notice and an opportunity to respond to the allegations made against him.9 As noted above, the Appellants' current counsel did not comply with the steps outlined in the Practice Notice. However I have included consideration of counsel competence as part of my independent analysis in regard to whether there has been a breach of procedural fairness in this case.\n[14] I find no merit in any of the Appellants' current counsel's arguments in regard to a breach of procedural fairness. Incompetence or negligence of counsel amounts to a breach of procedural fairness in limited circumstances where: (a) the negligence or incompetence is sufficiently specific and clearly supported by evidence; and (b) there is a fairly arguable case that the result would have been different.10 In this case I do not find that there is evidence that the Appellants' former counsel acted incompetently by assisting the Appellants in amending their BOC at the outset at the hearing or by deciding not to call a witness. Indeed, I find that the RPD panel was correct in enabling the Appellants and their counsel to take a few minutes off the record to make any last minute corrections to their written statement.\n[15] I find it was also open to former counsel to call or not to call witnesses on behalf of the Appellants at the hearing and there was opportunity for him to do so. In the absence of contradictory evidence it is reasonable to assume that the Appellants' former counsel's decisions were taken together with the Appellants and within the confines of solicitor-client privilege. I also find no error of procedural fairness in the RPD Member discussing procedural matters with the Appellants' counsel at the outset of the hearing and then asking the interpreter to provide a summary to the Appellants as was done in this case.11\n[16] I find no error in the RPD examining the Appellants in regard to inconsistencies it perceives to exist between the Appellants' BOC narratives and their testimony. Indeed it could be an error of law for the RPD not to bring such inconsistencies to the attention of the Appellants at the hearing if they were relevant to the decision. In this case the Appellants have not specifically pointed to where such questions were inappropriate or caused a breach of procedural fairness.\n[17] Finally, I note that there is a brief break in the audiotape recording between the end of the testimony of the principal Appellant and the initial questions asked of the adult Associate Appellant.12 The break appears to be about 5 minutes in length and it is unclear whether this break occurred because the RPD panel neglected to turn on the audio recorder after a pause in the proceedings or whether there was a technical glitch in the recording device. However, the Appellants have not made an argument in regard to what evidence was adduced during this part of the hearing that if recorded, would have changed the outcome of the RPD decision and they have not shown where the technical glitch was prejudicial to the Appellants.\n[18] The missing part of the audio-tape\/transcript appears to have included the opening question from the RPD member to the adult Associate Appellant. The part of the questioning that was recorded at that juncture was related to evidence provided by the adult Associate Appellant about why she did not report to the police that her husband was missing even after three days. There was mention of the Appellants fearing to seek state protection in the principal Appellant's BOC.13 At the hearing the RPD was inquiring about the reasons for the failure of the Appellants to seek police assistance in regard to the kidnapping and assault of the principal Appellant in Jordan.\n[19] This issue was addressed by the RPD panel in its reasons for decision (cite RPDR page 9). The RPD did not find it reasonable that the principal or associate Appellant would not have turned to the state for protection during or following the principal Appellant's kidnapping and did not accept the explanations that if they did so the police could have then in effect become the agents of persecution.14 I make the same finding as the RPD in this regard. There is no evidence that it is illegal to practice the Shia religion in Jordan and as noted by the RPD panel, it would have been possible to report the principal Appellants disappearance to police without revealing anything about religious conversion.\n[20] In carefully considering both the audio tape, transcript and the whole of the record in my independent analysis, I find that there was sufficient reason for the RPD to doubt the credibility of the principal Appellant's story regarding his kidnapping. I find that the Appellants have not met their onus under the SCC decision in Ward to provide \"clear and convincing\" evidence of a failure of the state to provide protection given the state was never approached for protection and there was no reasonable explanation for the failure of the Appellants to approach authorities. I find it reasonable to assume that if the portion of the record where the associate Appellant was asked about state protection had been properly recorded, it would have changed the outcome of the RPD overall finding that the Appellants' story lacked sufficient credibility.\n[21] I find no breach of procedural fairness because of this technical error in the audio recording. I also find no breach of procedural fairness in regard to any of the other matters raised by the Appellants linked to either the competence of former counsel or the conduct of the hearing by the RPD panel member.\nDid the RPD err in its Credibility Assessment?\n[22] The Appellants argue that the RPD erred in its credibility assessment about the genuineness of the principal Appellant's conversion to the Shia sect.15 Specifically, the Appellants' current counsel argues that the entire written narrative should be \"awestricken\" (sic) and that the RPD should have considered only the Appellant's testimony at the hearing in regard to when he converted to the Shia sect. In my independent analysis of the record I find no reason to disregard the Appellants' BOC narrative which clearly states that in Norway the principal Appellant became \"convinced of the Shia faith and decided to accept the Shia practice.\"16 However at the hearing the principal Appellant denied that he had converted to the Shia sect while in Norway.17 I find that it was incumbent upon the principal Appellant to clearly establish when and where he converted to the Shia sect given this is the central element of the Appellants' refugee claims.\n[23] At the hearing the RPD pointed out to the principal Appellant that later in the same narrative the Appellant stated that when he returned to Jordan he was \"struggling between living by the practices as a Sunni or a Shia.\"18 The explanation of the principal Appellant and now his\ncurrent counsel, was that the statement in the BOC was wrong. I find no error in the RPD determination that the principal Appellant's inability to clearly establish when he had converted to the Shia sect undermines the credibility of his evidence that such a conversion took place at all.\n[24] The Appellants also attack the RPD's credibility finding that there was an unresolved contradiction between the Appellants' narrative and his testimony in regard to the circumstances of the attack against the principal Appellant at the Shia shrine in Jordan. In his BOC the principal Appellant stated that \"When we arrived we found six or seven men awaiting us; We tried to exchange Salams (greetings) but they started yelling and cursing us.\"19 However at the hearing the principal Appellant stated that \"we initiated peace greetings. They did not respond.\" The principal Appellant went on to state that those who attacked him \"started to curse us when we started our rituals.\"20\n[25] When the RPD panel confronted the principal Appellant at the hearing with the above inconsistency, he stated that the BOC had been mistranslated. The RPD did not accept this explanation. I note that the principal Appellant's BOC, which includes the narrative, was translated to the principal Appellant as per his own declaration in the BOC form.21 Like the RPD, I find this inconsistency further undermines the credibility of the principal Appellant's testimony.\n[26] The Appellants have not contested the RPD finding that the Appellants have not established a sur place element to their refugee claim because of the principal Appellant's religious activities in Canada. I find there is no persuasive evidence that the principal Appellants religious activities in Canada would come to the attention of authorities in Jordan and if they did that he or the associate Appellants would be persecuted in Jordan for that reason.\n[27] The Appellants have not met their onus in regard to establishing persecution for religious or imputed religious opinion based on the testimony of the principal and adult associate Appellants and on their BOC or documentary evidence they have submitted. I note that the RPD has also examined the objective circumstances of the Shia minority in Jordan. In its analysis the RPD clearly considered the evidence contained in the National Documentation Package.22 I will also briefly address the objective documentary evidence in my independent analysis.\n[28] The objective evidence on the record establishes that over 97 per cent of Jordan's population are Sunni Muslim; the Shia Muslim population is estimated to be considerably less than one percent.23 Reports of discrimination contained in the evidence do not include discrimination against those converting from the Sunni to the Shia sect of Islam.\n[29] I accept that there is documentary evidence in regard to discriminatory treatment of the Shia minority generally; against converts from Islam (which is prohibited by Sharia law); and against the portion of the Shia minority in Jordan who are Iranian or Iraqi Shites. However, I do not find that the evidence on the record establishes that overall, Shias are persecuted in Jordan or prohibited from practicing their faith in accordance with the Jordanian constitution.24\n[30] I find no error in the RPD's analysis. The RPD decision stands.\nCONCLUSION\n[31] The RAD dismisses the appeal and confirms the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection, pursuant to section 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\n(signed)\n\"Richard Jackson\"\nRichard Jackson\nMay 15, 2019\nDate\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD File \/ Dossier de la SAR : VB8-06434\nVB8-06435 \/ VB8-06436 \/ VB8-06437\nRAD.25.02 (April 04, 2019)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n10\nImmigration and Refugee\nBoard of Canada\nRefugee Appeal Division\nCommission de l'immigration\net du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 du Canada\nSection d'appel des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s\nRAD.25.02 (April 04, 2019)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] XXXX XXXX, (the principal male Appellant), referred herein as the Appellant, XXXX (the principal Appellant's spouse), XXXX XXXX (the oldest minor son of the two adult Appellants), XXXX XXXX, (the youngest minor son of the two adult Appellants), and XXXX XXXX XXXX, (the minor daughter of the adult Appellants), are citizens of Guyana. They appeal a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) denying their claims for refugee protection. The Appellants respectfully request that the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) set aside the decision of the RPD and the appeal be allowed. The Appellants request that the RAD find that they are Convention refugees or persons in need of protection.\nMemorandum of Appeal\n(i) The panel's decision did not reflect the appropriate assessment of the best interests of the children and constituted a major reviewable error.\n(ii) The panel's negative credibility findings were based on incomplete examination and negligence of the provided supporting evidences and constituted a reviewable error.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] Pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), the RAD confirms the determination of the RPD and dismisses the appeal. The RAD determines that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees, nor persons in need of protection, pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.\nBACKGROUND\n[3] The adult male Appellant and the minor Appellants rely on the female Appellant's (FA) Basis of Claim (BOC) narrative. The principal female Appellant acted as the designated representative (DR) for the minor Appellants.\n[4] The Appellant outlined her family situation in China before she and her current spouse immigrated to Guyana in XXXX 2001 and became citizens in XXXX 2011. The minor Appellants were born in Guyana and are Guyanese citizens.\n[5] The FA described the working conditions when they worked in a friend's restaurant. She described a criminal incident in December 2003 and the resulting incarceration of the perpetrators. She outlined other incidents and how the police were ineffectual in dealing with the harassments they suffered. The FA described her son being hit by a car driven by a drunk Guyanese driver in 2007. She described a robbery in March 2010, an incident not reported to the police. An incident, in 2013, regarding a car collision was reported to the police but nothing was done. In addition to the above, her sons often experience discriminatory treatment when at school.\n[6] On XXXX XXXX, 2014, a Guyanese male grabbed their daughter and they paid XXXX USD to have her released; an incident that was not reported to the police. An incident occurred on December 20, 2014 while the FA was on a shopping trip with her children. The perpetrator was one of the men who had put a gun to her in the restaurant in 2003. He made a handgun signal, pointed the gun to his neck, and laughed. The police refused to take the report in that there was no evidence.\n[7] Feeling unsafe in Guyana, they decided to leave. They did not like the conditions in China if they chose to return there. In February 2015, the family moved away to live in a new place.\n[8] The RPD hearings were held on June 24, 2016 and August 4, 2016. In a decision of September 2, 2016, the RPD found that the Appellants were neither a Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n[9] The RPD decision was appealed to the RAD and in a decision of February 13, 2017, the RAD confirmed the RPD decision and found that the Appellants were neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n[10] The RAD decision was appealed to the Federal Court, and in a decision of September 20, 2017, Justice Campbell allowed the judicial review, setting aside the RAD decision, and remitting it to a differently constituted panel of the RAD for re-determination.\nAdmissibility of Evidence Submitted on Appeal\n[11] Subsection 110(4) of the IRPA provides that the Appellants may present only evidence that arose after the rejection of their claim or that was not reasonably available, or that they could not reasonably have been expected1 in the circumstances to have presented at the time of the rejection.\n[12] It is for the Appellants to make full and detailed submissions in their Memorandum about how any proposed new evidence meets the requirements of subsection 110(4), and how that evidence relates to the Appellants.2\nApplication of Subsection 110(4)\n[13] Subsection 110(4) establishes a disjunctive test.3 The RAD must first consider whether the proposed new evidence arose after the rejection of the refugee claim. If it did, the evidence meets the requirements of the section. If it did not, the RAD must consider whether the evidence was reasonably available for presentation to the RPD prior to the rejection of the claims. If it was not reasonably available at that time, it meets the requirements of subsection 110(4). If the evidence did not arise after the rejection, and it was reasonably available, the RAD must consider whether the Appellant could reasonably have been expected, in their circumstances, to have presented the evidence to the RPD prior to the rejection of their claim. If they could not have been expected to do so, the evidence meets the requirements of the section.\n[14] If the evidence did not arise after the rejection of the claim, was reasonably available, and could reasonably have been expected, in the circumstances, to be presented to the RPD prior to the rejection of the claim, the evidence does not meet the test in subsection 110(4). The RAD does not have the discretion to admit such evidence.4\n[15] As the RAD understands it, subsection 110(4) provides the Appellant with an opportunity to present evidence that could not have been submitted to the RPD.\n[16] Subsection 110(4) does not provide an opportunity for the Appellant to complete a deficient record submitted to the RPD; rather, it allows for the correction of errors of fact, errors in law, or mixed errors of fact and law.5\n[17] In considering whether the evidence arose after the rejection of the claim, the RAD will not restrict its analysis to the date on the proposed new evidence. In the RAD's view, a document's \"newness\" cannot be tested solely by the date of its creation; what is important is the event or circumstance sought to be proved by the evidence.6 Old evidence remains old evidence, even if it is placed in a new document with a recent date.\nAssessment of Evidence that Meets the Requirements of Subsection 110(4)\n[18] Where a document meets the test in subsection 110(4) as discussed above, the RAD will conduct a further assessment of that evidence. While subsection 110(4) provides the RAD with factors to consider in assessing a document's \"newness,\" these factors alone cannot determine the admissibility of new evidence in an appeal. To put it simply, if a document is lacking in credibility or is irrelevant, it would make little sense to admit such a document, even if it meets the test in subsection 110(4).\n[19] In Singh,7 the Federal Court of Appeal (FCA) held that there is no valid reason the RAD cannot apply the criteria set out in Raza8 to the assessment of new evidence. While Raza predates the introduction of the IRPA's subsection 110(4), it is based on the nearly identical wording of section 113(a). In that case, the FCA held that new evidence should be considered for its credibility, relevance, newness, and materiality, in addition to any express statutory provisions.9 In Singh, the FCA found that the criteria from Raza are necessarily implied in the wording of subsection 110(4).10\n[20] Where evidence meets the test in subsection 110(4), the RAD will go on to assess it for credibility. While this is a factor set out in Raza, there are also other reasons to apply to it. Subparagraph 171(a.3) of the IRPA allows the RAD to receive and base a decision on evidence that is adduced in the proceedings and considered \"credible or trustworthy in the circumstances.\" This provision makes it clear that, in addition to the factors in subsection 110(4), the RAD must consider the credibility or trustworthiness of the proposed new evidence.\n[21] Relevance is a basic condition for the admissibility of any piece of evidence.11 The RAD Rule (3)(3)(g)(iii) requires the Appellant's Memorandum to include full and detailed submissions about how any proposed new evidence \"relates to the Appellant.\" It would be highly inefficient for the RAD to admit irrelevant evidence, and contrary to subsection 162(2) of the IRPA, which requires that all divisions of the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) \"deal with all proceedings before it as informally and quickly as the circumstances and the considerations of fairness and natural justice permit.\"\n[22] In addition to credibility and relevance, the factors in Raza include \"newness\" and \"materiality.\" Newness is implicitly incorporated into subsection 110(4) and does not require additional analysis. The FCA has also found materiality to be redundant, as it is also found in subsection 110(6) of the IRPA, which describes when the RAD may hold an oral hearing.12\nNew Evidence\n[23] The Appellants' referred to evidence submitted for the RPD hearing in regards to an oral hearing being held at the RAD. Although the Appellant's position on whether this evidence is new is unclear, the RAD will examine the documents referred to.\n[24] The documentation13 referred to in the Memorandum of Appeal14 was submitted on June 1, 2015, to the RPD and was considered in its decision. The RAD finds that this evidence does not meet the criteria of section 110(4) of the IRPA and will not accept it as new evidence.\n[25] Documentation15 referred to and referenced above in the Memorandum of Appeal was submitted to the RPD on May 12, 2016, and considered in its decision. The RAD finds that this evidence does not meet the criteria of section 110(4) of the IRPA and will not accept it as new evidence.\n[26] Documentation16 referred to and referenced above in the Appellant's Memorandum of Appeal was submitted to the RPD on May 18, 2016, and considered in its decision. The RAD finds that this evidence does not meet the criteria of section 110(4) of the IRPA and will not accept it as new evidence. In that no new evidence has been accepted, the RAD will not hold an oral hearing according to section 110(6) of the IRPA.\nROLE OF THE RAD\n[27] The Appellant made no submissions regarding the provisions outlined in the decision of the FCA in Huruglica,17 which provides guidance in relation to the appropriate standard that must be applied by a specialized tribunal, such as the RAD, to decisions of the first-level administrative tribunal.\n[28] The FCA stated that, with respect to findings of fact (and mixed fact and law), which raised no issue of credibility of oral evidence, the RAD is to review RPD decisions by applying the correctness standard. Pursuant to paragraph 111(2)(b) of the IRPA, the RAD may refer the matter back to the RPD for redetermination if it is \"of the opinion\" that it cannot make a decision confirming or setting aside the RPD's decision without hearing the evidence presented before the RPD. For questions of fact, mixed fact and law, and law, I have applied the standard of correctness, as per Huruglica. In assessing issues involving credibility of oral testimony, I have applied the RAD modified standard of reasonableness in those situations where the RPD enjoys a meaningful advantage in making a particular finding, as per the decision in X (Re), 2017 CanLII 33034 (CA IRB). It further indicates that, although the RAD should sometimes exercise a degree of restraint before substituting its own determination, the issue of whether the circumstances warrant such restraint ought to be addressed on a case-by-case basis.\n[29] Accordingly, the RAD will conduct its assessment of the RPD's decision on the basis of the principles outlined above.\nMerits of the Appeal\nBest Interests of the Children (Minor Appellants)\n[30] The Appellant submit that the RPD only mentioned the Board's Child Guidelines but made no analysis of the best interests of the children. They reference the Chairpersons Guideline 3: Child Refugee Claimants: Procedural and Evidentiary Issues,18 the general principal. The Appellant's also reference Federal jurisprudence19 to support its submissions.\n[31] The RAD in reviewing the Chairpersons Guideline 3 makes the following findings. Under the heading of Scope of Application of the Children's Guidelines, it states that the principle of \"best interests of the child\" is a general principle for determining the appropriate procedure for processing the claim of a child. It goes on to state that the focus will remain the procedural and evidentiary issues as referred to in section 97(1)(a)(b) of the IRPA.\n[32] In reviewing the information providing it in the BOC narrative20 and testimony, the RAD finds that the alleged persecution in this case was primarily against the adult Appellants and perpetrated by criminal elements. The references to the children were an alleged automobile accident, and an alleged attempted abduction in order to obtain money from the parents.\n[33] IRPA, section 167(2) states that \"If a person who is the subject of proceedings is under 18 years of age or unable, in the opinion of the applicable Division, to appreciate the nature of the proceedings, the Division shall designate a person to represent the person.\" The RPD must appoint a designated representative whose responsibilities are to retain and instruct counsel to make decisions for the child with respect to the procedures. The DR also has a responsibility to inform the child about the various stages of the proceedings, to assist the child in obtaining evidence in support of the claim, and to provide evidence and be a witness in the claims and to act in the best interests of the child.\n[34] According to the documentation on file, the FA, the children's mother, was appointed as the DR at the RPD and did acknowledge her awareness of the duties as outlined above. This confirmation of the DR was continued at the RAD. The RAD finds that the appropriate procedures were followed to look after the \"best interests of the children.\"\nIncomplete Examination of Supporting Evidence\n[35] The Appellants submit that the RPD, either unintentionally or intentionally, minimized the impact of crime and violence in Guyana by failing to completely consider the countries documentary evidence regarding Chinese businessmen.\n[36] The Appellant's referenced the National Documentation Package (NDP) documentation21 to outline the ineffectiveness of police and racial polarization between the Indo-Guyanese and the Afro-Guyanese community. He submits that the ethnic Chinese in Guyana are actually the sandwich of the two racially polarized communities and that Chinese businessmen are criminally and discriminately targeted by both sides thanks to their wealth.\n[37] The Appellants referred to a Ministry of Home Affairs (MoHA) article, referenced above, and submits that the RPD's consideration of documentary evidence on crime and violence was incomplete and incorrect. The Appellants' submit that the RPD only considered the risk to Chinese in Guyana and neglected to state that the adult Appellants are Chinese businessmen in Guyana who were constantly targeted and politically discriminated against by both the Indo-Guyanese and the Afro-Guyanese communities.\n[38] The RAD finds that the Appellant's submission, quoting NDP documentation, that refers to the ineffectiveness of police and relating it to racial polarization, is speculative and no documentation was submitted to support this submission. As will be outlined below, the incidence of crime and criminal activities in Guyana is rampant against all Guyanese.\n[39] The RAD references NDP documentation22 that refers to the racial tension that existed prior to the 2011 elections. The tensions noted, were between the Afro-Guyanese population and the Indo-Guyanese population. The United States 2015 Crime in Safety Report that ethnic and religious diversity have not been directly linked to incidents of violence in recent years.23\n[40] NDP documentation24 states that the police force is predominantly Afro-Guyanese and that Indo-Guyanese business owners tend to rely on private security providers with their own weapons for protection rather than the police force. The RAD finds that the security environment for business owners in Guyana is precarious. The documentation referenced above state that conflicts have existed primarily between the Afro-Guyanese and Indo-Guyanese. No documentation was presented to support the Appellant's speculation that they were caught in the middle of these two groups. Also there is no documentation in NDP documentation to suggest that ethnic Chinese were being targeted because of their race. The documentation focuses on the fact that people of perceived wealth or money are targeted. The adult Appellants are restaurant owners, and would reasonably be perceived as people of wealth or having money. The RAD finds, on a balance of probabilities, that they were targeted because they were restaurant owners and perceived to be wealthy and\/or have money.\n[41] NDP documentation25 states that violent crime against everyone is a major problem and that robbery and murder are on the rise. Figures for robbery, indicate that there are an average of three armed robberies per day. No probative evidence was submitted that robberies against Chinese indicated a disproportionate targeting of Chinese people, given that there were probably 3000 robberies in Guyana during this time. The RAD finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the fact that Chinese businessmen are victims of crime does not, in and of itself, indicate that Chinese businessmen are disproportionately victimized or that they are targeted because of their race.\n[42] The Appellants presented an article from the Stabroek News that states that the Home Affairs concerned at persistent robberies against Chinese, dated March 6, 2013.26 The article refers to a surge in robberies and attacks against Chinese and suggests that the attacks were politically inspired. No information is given concerning this political motivation. The RAD prefers the NDP documentation on the situation in Guyana with respect to crime and the Chinese population. In addition, nothing in the article suggests that the Appellants were involved in the attacks mentioned.\n[43] A second article was given in documentation,27 Attack on Chinese investment is an attack on all Guyanese, dated August 19, 2014. The RAD finds that the article appears to be political in nature, refers to the then existing governments policies, and makes a political statement to support a portion of the electorate. There is nothing in the report to personalize the circumstances of the Appellants.\n[44] The Appellants submitted an article,28 the August 25, 2014, where the Commissioner and Commander of police stated that there had been a surge in criminal attacks on Chinese nationals and businesses in Guyana. The same article notes the high level of gangsterism in Georgetown without specifically naming any racial group. The chief goes on to speculate why he believes they have been attacked and their vulnerability particularly in Georgetown. The RAD finds that this article is not probative in supporting the Appellants submissions that Chinese businessmen are targeted more than others. As stated above, the RAD prefers the NDP documentation that gives a balanced approach to the problem of criminality in Guyana.\nOther Issues\nIn the alternative-Generalized Risk\n[45] In the alternative, the RPD found that the Appellants are also disqualified under the \"generalized risk\" clause in sub-paragraph 97(1)(b)(ii) of the IRPA. The RPD stated that risk may only lead to refugee protection if, \"the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country.\"\n[46] The RPD reasoned that the Appellant's risk is that of being robbed or burglarized in the context of a common crime targeting business owners and people of money. The RPD stated there is no agent of persecution identified other than common criminals, and there is no indication of escalating harm, repeat victimization by anyone, or risk of future reprisals.\n[47] The RPD found that the risk faced by the Appellants was faced by the population generally, or even a significant group of the population. In the RPD's view, business owners and people with money are a significant group within the population. As found above, robberies in Guyana are common and widespread, and the RPD rejected that the Appellants were in any way personally targeted.\n[48] The RPD found, pursuant to the IRPA that the Appellants' claim was not based on a genuine fear or risk of serious harm in Guyana.\n[49] The Appellants, in its Memorandum, did not address this issue specifically but made general references to the persecution faced by Chinese businessmen in Guyana.\n[50] The RAD concurs with the RPD that this claim would fall under the category of \"generalized\" risk for the following reasons. The RAD finds that the Appellants were not personally targeted, and the risk is one that is generally faced by others in Guyana i.e. individuals perceived to be wealthy or have money.\n[51] The RAD as stated above and quoting NDP documentation,29 finds that violent crimes continue to rise, and that there is no indication in the sources that the risk is higher for ethnic Chinese people. The fact that a person or group of people may be victimized repeatedly or more frequently by criminals, for example, because of their perceived wealth or because they live in a more dangerous area,30 or that they continue to be pursued after reporting to police or relocating (Rodriguez Perez,),31 or that they face retaliation for not complying with the demands of the criminals,32 does not remove the risk from the exception if it is one faced generally by others. Thus, the consequential harm faced in these circumstances does not mean that the risk is not a generalized one.33\n[52] The Appellant and her husband were business owners, and the documentation quoted above clearly indicates that business owners are targeted by criminals in Guyana. The RAD considered the NDP documentation and finds that serious crimes, including murder and armed robbery are common. The documentation also states that are robberies occur regularly especially in businesses and shopping districts and that they are becoming increasingly common. The RAD also found nothing in the documentation to indicate that these robberies are motivated by ethnicity, but rather are criminal acts against individuals perceived to have money.\nConclusion\n[53] With respect to the specific robberies testified to the panel by the Appellants, the police, according to the documentation presented,34 visited the scene, interviewed the family, but no useful report was taken. The RPD found the Appellants credible, and stated in its decision, that there may have been some racial motivation by the local police. The RAD cannot agree with this comment in the RPD decision. The RAD finds that the RPD relied upon the testimony of the Appellants, testimony that the RAD finds, is speculative. No documentary proof has been provided to support such a conclusion; it relies on the credible testimony of the Appellants, but testimony that is speculative in nature, and is the personal opinion of the Appellants. The RPD prefers the NDP documentation quoted over the personal opinion and speculation of the Appellants.\nPersons in Need of Protection\n[54] The RPD found that, under subsection 97(1) of the IRPA, that the Appellants would not be subjected to a risk personally since they are victims of general crime. They identified no agents of harm other than common criminals and looking forward, testified they fear only common criminals. They have not established a motive for the robberies other than money. The RPD found that any harm, they would face in the future would be crime for which they are not personally targeted. As a result, the RPD found the Appellants were not persons in need of protection.\n[55] The Appellants did not specifically address this issue, on appeal.\n[56] The RAD reviewing the documentation and testimony at the hearing, finds, on a balance of probabilities, that there was no evidence that the Appellants were targeted personally.\nDisposition\n[57] The RAD finds that the Appellants are not Convention refugees, nor persons in need of protection, and dismisses the appeal, and confirms the RPD's decision according to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the IRPA.\n(signed)\n\"Robert S.

In XXXX 2018, the Taliban held the appellants and their employees hostage in Kurram Agency, Federally Administered Tribal Area (FATA) near the border of Afghanistan. The Taliban accused the appellants of being in Afghanistan and demanded 50% of their profits. They held them for about 40 days.\n[6] The appellants escaped to Peshawar, their hometown. The Taliban called them and demanded further money to secure the release of their employees. The employees eventually escaped. The appellants paid the Taliban XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX United States Dollars (USD) for their safety in XXXX 2019.\n[7] In XXXX 2019, the appellants received a further ransom demand in the form of a letter. They were escorted to a house by the Taliban and the police. The appellants were forced to sign an agreement, stating that they would deliver XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX USD to the Taliban by XXXX 2019.\n[8] The same month the appellants fled to the United States (USA) and then to Canada, where they made a refugee claim.\nThe Role of the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD)\n[9] I am required to examine the record independently and determine if the RPD arrived at the correct decision.1\n[10] The RPD found the appellants to be credible witnesses and that they had a viable internal flight alternative (IFA) in Hyderabad or Islamabad.\n[11] I find IFA to be determinative.\nNo new evidence; no oral hearing\n[12] The appellants are not filing any new evidence, which is a pre-requisite for an oral hearing. They are not requesting an oral hearing.\n[13] As there is no new evidence, I have no jurisdiction to convene an oral hearing.\nThe RPD was correct to find that the appellants would be safe in the IFAs\n[14] The appellants argue that the RPD was incorrect to find they would be safe from the agents of persecution in the IFA. The Taliban are present throughout Pakistan, including Islamabad and Hyderabad. The RPD also erred by presuming that the appellants are ordinary citizens. This is not the case; their work in XXXX means they will be easily located by the Taliban.\n[15] I disagree with the appellants' arguments for the following reasons. In brief, I find that the Taliban are not motivated to locate the appellants in the IFA and that the appellants are citizens with everyday profiles. They have failed to establish that their work in XXXX fundamental to their idenity.\nThe agents of persecution: the Taliban\n[16] The Taliban or the Tehrik-e-Taliban (the TTP) is a group that has taken up arms against the Pakistani state and carries out violent attacks inside the country. The organization is an umbrella with groups coming and leaving. The TTP is closely allied with the Afghan Taliban in their fight against the Afghan troops. Reports state that there has been a decline in the activity of the TTP, attributed to increased military offences by the Pakistani state. 2\n[17] Islamabad is the Federal Capital Region of the country and under the control of the state. Hyderabad is in Sindh Province, which generally see less armed, organized violence. In KP and the FATA, the Taliban are waging an insurgency, though their strongholds in FATA may have been mostly eliminated. 3\n[18] The appellants had their first encounter with the Taliban in the FATA close to the Afghan border and their second in Peshawar, KP. Both these areas are home to the Taliban. The persecutors have not accused the appellants of blasphemy or any other anti-Islamic activity. The IFAs are not located in a Taliban-stronghold. They are geographically removed from both KP and FATA. Geographical distance alone does not render the IFA safe but is nonetheless a factor in my analysis.\n[19] In January 2016, the TTP was believed to have 35,000 core volunteers and conscript fighters.4 There may be overlap in the membership of these militant groups. The TTP was formed in 2007 in the South Waziristan Agency of the FATA, when 13 militant groups united under the leadership of Baitullah Mehsud. The TTP has spread into all four provinces of Pakistan. Baitullah Mehsud was killed in a drone strike in 2009. After a power struggle Hakimullah Mehsud took control until his death in 2013. He was followed by Mullah Fazlullah, who does not belong to the Mehsud tribe nor is he from the FATA (the Mehsud tribe from the FATA constitutes the core membership of the TTP). This upset the internal balance of TTP. Since 2014, the TTP has been internally divided. 5 Fazlullah died in 2018 in a United States drone strike. Mufti Noor Wali Mehsud is the current leader; he is from the Mehsud tribe.6\n[20] The TTP is not a monolithic organization. It is a loose agglomerate of approximately 40 Islamist factions and Pashtun tribal factions from the FATA and KP. It is ethnically diverse. In 2014 and then in 2017, the Pakistani state launched major offensives against the TTP, further reducing the ability of the Taliban to plan and execute operations. In 2014, many TTP militants fled into Afghanistan to escape the military offensive.7\n[21] The TTP's most common form of attack is bombings. Preferred targets are security forces and other symbols of the state that the TTP considers \"un-Islamic\", such as schools that educate girls or the children of Pakistani security forces. The TTP also conducts hit-and-run raids against the security forces to wear down morale. 8 The TTP are also known to raise funds from criminal activities, such as the extortion experienced by the appellants.\n[22] About a half of the Pakistani Taliban coalesce under the umbrella of the TTP. The other half are loosely affiliated with the TTP or have no association at all. While there are divisions within the TTP and between the TTP and the Pakistani Taliban, the factions refrain from fighting each other. The TTP is closely allied with Al-Qaeda, providing shelter to its members. In return, they receive logistical guidance. 9\n[23] In major cities, the TTP is present and extorts business owners, maintaining control over cities, particularly Karachi. 10\nThe appellants' interactions with the TTP\n[24] I find that the TTP are fragmented due to recent attacks by the military and internal issues. I find that they are strongest in the FATA and KP, where they did target the appellants. However, this does not mean that the appellants would not be safe in the IFAs.\n[25] There is no evidence to any attempts on part of the Taliban to locate the appellants since their departure in XXXX 2019. There is no evidence that the Taliban made any threats after the appellants failed to pay the ransom in XXXX 2019. They have not sought the appellants in Peshawar or through their colleagues in the XXXX XXXXandXXXX XXXX XXXX. They have not publicly stated that the appellants are enemies of the Taliban and\/or their interpretation of Islam.\n[26] I find that the appellants were targets of convenience in the FATA and Peshawar. This does not mean that the Taliban is motivated to locate the appellants throughout Pakistan. If they were motivated, the evidence establishes that the persecutors could locate the appellants through their connections with the police and\/or the tenant registration system. The appellants' evidence is devoid the persecutors attempting to locate them through friends, family, social media etc.\n[27] While the Taliban had connections with the police in Peshawar and they may have connections with the police in the IFAs, there is no evidence that the Taliban have used their connections to issue warrants or reports against the appellants or to ascertain their present whereabouts.\n[28] I find that the appellants have failed to establish that the persecutors are motivated to locate the appellants throughout Pakistan.\nThe RPD was correct to find the IFAs reasonable\n[29] The appellants argue that the RPD was incorrect to find the IFAs reasonable (the second prong of the IFA test).\n[30] They allege that the IFAs are unreasonable because the Taliban are present in Islamabad and Hyderabad. I have addressed this argument. I have found that while the Taliban are present throughout Pakistan, they are fragmented. Their strongholds are in the FATA and in KP. Furthermore, they are not motivated to track the appellants in the country.\n[31] They argue that IFA is unreasonable as they will be unable to secure employment. The co-appellant does not speak the local language. The appellants are employed in a niche and therefore easy to locate. I will address this argument in my next section.\n[32] The appellants both speak English, Urdu, and Pashto. English and Urdu are the two official languages of Pakistan. Pashto and Urdu are spoken by 8% of the population each; Sindhi by 12%. 11 While neither appellant speaks Sindhi, this hardship is mitigated by the appellants' mastery of English and Urdu. The appellants are both Sunni Muslim; 85 to 90% of the population is Sunni Muslim. Finally, a second IFA was proposed by the RPD: Islamabad, which is not in Sindh Province.\n[33] The principal appellant has six years of university education12 and the co-appellant 12 years of formal education, 13 which is more than the average nine years of education received by males in Pakistan. 14 Their higher-than-average education mitigates against the unreasonableness of the IFAs.\n[34] The unemployment rate in Pakistan is 6%15 though much of the population is engaged in the informal work sector. This low figure is not considered realistic.16 Unemployment is higher among women and among youth.17 The appellants are correct in their allegations that wealth is not equally distributed within Pakistan, 18 but this fact does not render the IFA unreasonable.\n[35] The test for unreasonableness in IFA is often described as unduly harsh conditions or conditions that jeopardize the health and safety of the appellants.\n[36] While relocation to Hyderabad or Islamabad will be difficult and disconcerting (securing employment, finding a new place to live), there is no evidence that it jeopardizes the health\/safety of the appellants. Hyderabad and Islamabad are both large cities in Pakistan with services and infrastructure.\n[37] The appellant argue that it was unfair of the RPD to ask if there would be any issues to relocating to the IFAs if it were not for the Taliban. However, they do not explain how this question is unreasonable. The question asked by the RPD is correct. IFA means that while there may be persecution\/risk in one part of the country, there may be other parts of the country that are safe and reasonable for the same individuals.\n[38] I find the proposed IFAs to be reasonable.\nI find that the Qaddafi case as argued by the appellants is not applicable\n[39] In the Qaddafi case, the RAD found that the individuals had a viable IFA in Hyderabad, where they would be safe from the Taliban. The Federal Court allowed the judicial review of the RAD decision and found that the RAD's finding that the individuals did not have a profile sufficient to be targeted by the Taliban was in error.\n[40] In Qaddafi, the principal applicant had done well for himself in Islamabad. It was unclear to the Federal Court if similar opportunities existed in Hyderabad. Finally, the applicants would struggle to re-establish themselves in an alien city in war-torn country.\n[41] First, I find that the appellants do not share the same profile as the principal applicant in Qaddafi, who had worked for the United Nations in aid work for ten years. Such work is often perceived as western or un-Islamic by the Taliban, particularly if the work involved assisting women. The threat letter left by the Taliban does not accuse the appellants of going against Islam; instead, it demands money. 19\n[42] Second, while the appellants will have difficulty in locating to either IFA, this struggle does not rise to an unreasonable level. Hyderabad and Islamabad are not in war-torn parts of Pakistan. Rather, it is parts of the FATA and KP which exist in states of lawlessness at times.\n[43] The appellants argue that they will be easily located because of their profession.\n[44] The appellants have not established that they are unable to practice any other profession or perform any other work. I accept that XXXX XXXXand XXXX is a small community of workers and that ethnic Afghans are involved in this work. I find that the appellants could seek employment in other sectors. There is no evidence to establish that their work is fundamental to their identity, as it could be for a doctor, a journalist, or a religious leader. The appellants' inability to work in their professions is not persecutory.\nConclusion\n[45] There is no serious possibility of persecution or risk to life or cruel and unusual punishment or treatment or danger of torture in the IFA. There is no undue hardship for the appellants to relocate to the proposed IFA.\n[46] I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection. 20\n(signed)\n\"R.

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] The Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship and the Minister of Public Safety appeals the June 25, 2018 decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) granting refugee status to XXXX XXXX XXXX. The Minister asks the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) to set aside the positive determination of the RPD. The RAD dismisses the appeal and confirms the decision of the RPD that the Respondent is a Convention refugee.\nBACKGROUND\n[2] According to his Basis of Claim Form (BOC),1 the Respondent was born in 1994. The Respondent alleges that his problems in Cameroon arise from his political activities and those of his family members. The Respondent's father was involved with the Social Democratic Front (SDF) but later he became a strong supporter of the Southern Cameroons National Council (SCNC).\n[3] The Respondent's sister, XXXX, has been active in the SCNC since 2001. The Respondent was heavily influenced by XXXX philosophy and actions in forming his own political opinion. XXXX was arrested in May 2003 and asked to cease her political activities. She continued to be involved with the SCNC and was targeted again in December 2006 but was warned by women in the village. XXXX was detained again in March 2007. She was interrogated, threatened, and beaten. Finally, she was detained again at the end of September 2010 and managed to escape. She fled to the United States in XXXX 2010 where she made a successful asylum claim.\n[4] The Respondent became active in the SCNC in 2011. He was detained by the police in January 2014 and asked to refrain from any political activities with the SCNC. He was questioned about his sister's whereabouts and her political activities. After his release, the respondent made plans to leave Cameroon. He applied to study at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in Surrey, British Columbia on March 30, 2014. During this time he continued his political activities. He was detained again in April 2014. The Respondent applied for a visa to study in Canada on May 19, 2014 and it was issued in July 2014. During this time the Respondent hid at a friend's home in Ekona. In July the authorities came to his father's home asking for him. His father told him he was visiting relatives in another city.\n[5] Since he left Cameroon, the authorities have continued to look for the Respondent. The Respondent arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2014 and made a claim for refugee protection on March 16, 2015. The Minister intervened before the RPD, the claim was heard on May 15, 2015 and the RPD made a positive determination on July 14, 2015. The Minister appealed and on January 21, 2016 the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) allowed the appeal and referred the matter to the RPD for redetermination by a differently constituted panel. On May 1 and June 25, 2018 the RPD reheard the claim and made a positive determination on July 9, 2018.\nSCOPE OF THE RAD REVIEW\n[6] The RAD reviews decisions of the RPD on a standard of correctness after conducting an independent assessment of the evidence before it. The exception to this rule is where the RPD enjoys a meaningful advantage in assessing and weighing the oral testimony heard, which in particular cases attracts deference. 2 Unless specifically stated below, I have applied the correctness standard.\nANALYSIS\n[7] The RPD found that the evidence demonstrated that the Respondent has a well-founded fear of harm if he were to return to Cameroon due to his political opinion and as a member of particular social group, being that of a family who are known to be political activists. The RPD found that the Respondent had already been targeted and will be targeted again for his ongoing support for the secession of Southern Cameroon and as the state is the persecutor, there can be no state protection or internal flight alternative.3\n[8] The Minister submits that the RPD's credibility findings were made without regard to the evidence before it and demonstrated an eagerness to find the Respondent credible notwithstanding the contradictions, inconsistencies and omissions in the evidence. Specifically, Minister argues that the RPD:\n* Failed to reconcile the testimony of the Respondent and the SCNC Chairman and the documentary evidence relating the authenticity of his SCNC membership card;\n* Did not take account of inconsistent evidence about the year the Respondent became a member of the SCNC, details of his alleged detentions in January and April 2014, and of visits by the authorities to the Respondent's father's home;\n* Misconstrued the evidence about the Respondent's failure to state the goals of the SCNC in his BOC;\n* Made excuses for the Respondent's incoherent testimony about his participation in a January 2, 2017 demonstration in front of the US Consulate in Vancouver; and\n* Erred in concluding that the Respondent is a member of a particular social group-family who are known to be political activists-in the absence of evidence of that the Respondent was targeted or has been targeted in Cameroon based on his family status.\n[9] I have reviewed the record including the Respondent's testimony, the testimony of his two witnesses, the documentary evidence including the new evidence submitted by the Appellant,4 and the objective evidence. I have considered the arguments of both the Appellant and the Respondent and undertaken my own analysis to find that, while the RPD made some errors, they are not determinative. The RPD correctly found that the Respondent has established, on a balance of probabilities, that he is a member of the SCNC and there is a serious possibility that he would be persecuted if he were to return to Cameroon.\nSCNC Membership Card\n[10] The RPD found that the authenticity of the Appellant's SCNC membership card is not an issue because there is so much evidence \"from the [SCNC] Chair and from the [Respondent] and from his sister XXXX and the father's evidence which all indicate the [Respondent] has been a member of the SCNC for years now.\"5\n[11] The Appellant argues that in reaching its conclusion on the SCNC membership card, the RPD erred by failing to reconcile and assess the conflicting evidence related to the membership card, including forensic evidence, and its implications on the credibility of the Respondent and the SCNC Chair. There was conflicting testimony relating to whether or not the SCNC Chair and the Respondent signed the SCNC membership card. The forensic report concluded that the SCNC Chair probably did not sign the membership card.\n[12] I agree with the Appellant about the conclusions of the forensic report and that both the Respondent and the SCNC Chair gave conflicting evidence about signing the SCNC membership card. They both said that they signed the card when the Respondent joined the SCNC in 2012 and subsequently changed their testimony. The Respondent said that he forgot to sign his card and that the SCNC Chair told him that sometimes the secretary signed the cards and that the secretary was with him the day he issued the membership card to the Respondent.\n[13] The determinative issue is whether the Appellant's legitimate concerns about the testimony and forensic evidence relating to the signing of the SCNC membership card are sufficient to undermine the credibility of the testimony of the SCNC Chair, the Respondent, and that of his sister XXXX about the Respondent's membership in the SCNC. I find that the RDP canvassed this issue at length, clearly addressed the Appellant's concerns and concluded that the Respondent was a member of the SCNC. Following my own assessment of the evidence, I agree with the RPD that, on a balance of probabilities, the Respondent is a member of the SCNC.\nInconsistent evidence\n[14] The Appellant also argues that inconsistent evidence was given by the Respondent, the SCNC Chair, and the Respondent's father about when the Respondent joined the SCNC and the details of his detentions in 2012. The Appellant submits that this inconsistent evidence affects the credibility of the Respondent and the SCNC Chair.\nBOC\nSchedule A6\nSCNC Chair Affidavit7\nFather's affidavit8\nResp. testimony9\nSCNC Chair testimony10\nDate of joining SCNC\nSoon after enrolling at XXXX XXXX XXXX\nSeptember 2011\nOctober 4, 2012 through XXXX XXXX structure\nWhile at the XXXX XXXX XXXX\n2012, I became a full member at the XXXX XXXX XXXX\nOctober 2012\nDate of starting XXXX XXXX XXXX\nSeptember 2013 amended to 2012\nSeptember 2013 (2012\/07-2013\/08 unemployed in Bamenda also living in Buea from 2012\/10)\nNot stated\nNot stated\nSeptember 2012, amended BOC at July 14, 2015 hearing\nNot stated\nDetention\nXXXX 2014, XXXX, 2 days\nXXXX 2014, XXXX, 5 days\nXXXX 15-17, 2014, XXXX\nXXXX 7-12, 2014, XXXX\nArrested in XXXX 2014 and XXXX 2014\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, 2 days\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 5 days\nDetained on XXXX 15, 2014 for 2 days and on XXXX 7, 2014 for 5 days\nDate of detention not discussed\n[15] Following my review of the evidence, as summarized above, I find that the only material inconsistency relates to the date that the Respondent started at the XXXX XXXX XXXX. I note that at the outset of the July 14, 2015 RPD hearing the Respondent amended the date he started at the XXXX XXXX XXXX from September 2013 to September 2012 in his BOC narrative saying that it had been a typographical error. The Respondent's counsel is identified as having assisted in the preparation of the BOC and the other application forms, which explains why the error also shows up in the Schedule A.\n[16] With respect to the Respondent's first detention, the Appellant submits that the Respondent testified that he was taken to the police station in Buea while his father's affidavit says he was taken to Batibo. As noted above the Respondent said he was taken to Batibo in both his BOC and his Schedule A. I have reviewed the transcript of the Respondent's testimony at his hearing on July 14, 2015 and note that, while the Respondent referenced SCNC meetings in Buea, he did not say that he was arrested in Buea and taken to the police station there. The evidence is not clear11 and the Respondent was not asked to clarify his evidence. The Appellant also notes that the Respondent's BOC and his father's affidavit omit to mention that the SCNC Chair tried to assist in the release. Again, the Respondent was not asked to explain the omission.\n[17] The Appellant also argues that the father's affidavit did not corroborate the Respondent's BOC evidence about visits to his father's house by authorities. The Appellant appears to have missed the statement in the Respondent's father's affidavit where he says: \"Security forces of La Republic De Cameroon [sic] have appeared at my home in August, September, November, 2014 and in January and April 2015.\"12\n[18] For the reasons outlined above, I am satisfied that the one material inconsistency relating to the date the Respondent started at the XXXX XXXX XXXX was corrected at an early opportunity and reasonably explained. I am not satisfied that the other issues raised by the Appellant are inconsistencies. In some cases, the Respondent was not afforded the opportunity to explain or clarify his evidence.\nGoal of the SCNC\n[19] The Appellant argues that the RPD misconstrued the Respondent's explanation why he failed to state the goal of the SCNC in his BOC when it found that that failure was an oversight. The Appellant argues that the Respondent's evidence was that he did not know why this was not in his BOC; it was not an oversight and it should have resulted in a negative credibility finding.\n[20] I have carefully reviewed the Respondent's evidence on this question 13 and find that when asked about the major goal of the SCNC he answered \"the major goal of the SCNC is to create independence for Southern Cameroon.\"14 When asked why he did not talk about that goal in his BOC, the Respondent seemed confused and said \"I guess that was part of my story. I say it in my story...Because I always say that in my story that SCNC is an organization that advocates for the separation of Southern Cameroon.\"15 When the RPD pointed out again that it was not in his BOC, the Respondent said \"I just explain my position in the SCNC and the reasons why I believe in in the SCNC, so I didn't...put it inside, I don't know why, but I didn't put it inside.\"16\n[21] The Respondent's evidence is that he was under the impression that the independence goal of the SCNC was in his story, his BOC. It was when the RPD pointed out again that it was not, in fact, part of his BOC that the Respondent said that it he did not know why he did not include it. The Appellant is right when it argues that the Respondent said he did not know why it was not in his BOC. However, the Respondent's evidence which preceded this statement suggests that he thought it was included so the RPD was not wrong when it characterized the omission as an oversight.\n[22] I am not sure that the distinction is material as the issue can only relate to the credibility of the Respondent's claim to be a member of the SCNC and is not sufficient to undermine the credibility of the testimony of the SCNC Chair, the Respondent, and that of his sister about the Respondent's membership in the SCNC. As detailed above, I agree with the RPD that, on a balance of probabilities, the Respondent is a member of the SCNC.\nJanuary 2, 2017 protest\n[23] The Appellant argues that the Respondent submitted evidence of his participation in a protest on January 2, 2017 in front of the US Consulate in Vancouver, which protest was contrived for the sole purpose of bolstering the Respondent's refugee claim. To support this argument the Appellant submitted evidence17 that: January 2, 2017 was a statutory holiday and the US Consulate was not open; there was no media coverage of the protest; there was no warning issued by the US Consulate relating to the protest; the media did report anti-Trump protests in front of or close to the Vancouver consulate on January 30, 2017 and February 5, 2017; the Southern Cameroonian community held demonstrations in the cities of Toronto, Ottawa, Quebec City, and Montreal on February 10, 2017 visiting the French and British Embassies.\n[24] The Respondent argues that the Appellant's evidence does not contradict the Respondent's testimony, and the fact there was not any media coverage of a small protest does not refute the Respondent's testimony that he participated in the demonstration on January 2, 2017.18 I note that the Respondent testified that protests took place in Calgary and Toronto but not on the same date.19\n[25] The Appellant is correct that the Respondent did testify that the January 2, 2017 protest was in response to \"what was happening back in Cameroon. There was a mass killing after the 1st day of October of 2017 (Indiscernible) National Day of the Southern Cameroon.\"20\n[26] The RPD addressed this point directly and found that the Respondent misstated the date as October 2017 because it did not make sense in the context of the January 2, 2017 demonstration which \"was in protest to action that had taken place several months earlier in October 2016.\"21 I note that the objective evidence is clear that the crisis faced by Anglophones in Cameroon began in October, 2016 resulting in violence, arrests and at least six deaths before the end of the year.22\n[27] Based on the foregoing I find that, on balance of probabilities, the Respondent participated in a demonstration in Vancouver on January 2, 2017 to protest the evolving crisis in Anglophone Cameroon, which started in October 2016.\nMembership in a social group\n[28] Following a detailed review of the evidence, the RPD concluded that the Respondent has \"a well-founded fear of harm if he were to return to Cameroon due to his political opinion and as a member of a particular social group, being that of a family who are known to be political activists. Because he's already been targeted, he will be targeted again for his ongoing support for the secession of South Cameroon from Cameroon itself.\"23\n[29] The Appellant submits that the RPD erred in mixed fact and law when it concluded that the Respondent is a member of a particular social group-family who are known to be political activists. The Appellant argues that there was no evidence before the RPD that the Respondent was targeted in Cameroon on the basis of his family status.\n[30] The Respondent argues that his evidence, and that of his father and sister XXXX, of numerous visits by the Cameroon authorities to his father's home demonstrates that their family has been targeted. I agree with the Appellant that there is no evidence that the Respondent's siblings or his mother have been targeted by the authorities based on their family status and that the family members are targeted because of their SCNC membership and activism and not because of their status as members of the XXXX family. The RPD may have erred in finding that the Respondent has a nexus to membership in a particular social group.\n[31] As detailed above, however, I agree with the RPD that the Respondent is a member of the SCNC. Based the testimony of the Respondent, the SCNC Chair and the Respondent's sister XXXX, supported by the documentary evidence from the Respondent's father and the objective evidence cited by the RPD in its reasons, I find that, on a balance of probabilities, the Respondent has established his claim that he has a well-founded fear of persecution if he were to return to Cameroon due to his political opinion as an Anglophone secessionist and SCNC member.\nCONCLUSION\n[32] The RAD dismisses the appeal and confirms the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is a Convention refugee.\n(signed)\n\"Susan Brown\"\nSusan Brown\nJanuary 28, 2019\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD File \/ Dossier de la SAR : VB8-04009\nRAD.25.02 (September 18, 2018)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n12\nImmigration and Refugee\nBoard of Canada\nRefugee Appeal Division\nCommission de l'immigration\net du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 du Canada\nSection d'appel des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s\nRAD.25.02 (September 18, 2018)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] XXXX XXXX (Appellant), a citizen of China, appeals a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD), dated January 14, 2021, rejecting his claim for refugee protection.\nDECISION\n[2] The appeal is dismissed. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nBACKGROUND\n[3] The Appellant alleged before the RPD that he fears returning to China because he is a Falun Gong practitioner and was sought by the Public Security Bureau (PSB).\n[4] The Appellant's application for refugee protection was heard on December 8, 2020. By a written decision on January 14, 2021, the RPD rejected the claim. The RPD found that the determinative issue was credibility.\n[5] The Appellant submits that the RPD erred in its credibility findings by failing to provide him with his rights to natural and fundamental justice and procedural fairness, and by failing to correctly consider and apply the relevant law.\nROLE OF THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION (RAD)\n[6] My role is to look at all of the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.1\nANALYSIS\nThe RPD erred in some of its findings but not in its overall conclusions\n[7] The RPD found that:\n(a) Due to the Appellant's ability to exit China using his own genuine passport, he was not of interest to Chinese authorities, on a balance of probabilities;\n(b) Due to the Appellant's failure to demonstrate a level of knowledge commensurate with the amount of time he alleged to have been practicing Falun Gong, he was not a Falun Gong practitioner in China and is not practicing Falun Gong in Canada, on a balance of probabilities; and\n(c) With regard to the sur place aspect of the claim, the Appellant's unsworn letters from fellow practitioners in Canada were awarded no weight. The RPD found, on a balance of probabilities, that owing to the credibility concerns, the Appellant engaged in Falun Gong activities in Canada for the purposes of bolstering a refugee claim and not because he is a genuinely committed Falun Gong practitioner. The RPD also found, on a balance of probabilities, that if the Appellant is practicing Falun Gong in Canada, this has not come to the attention of Chinese authorities.\n[8] The Appellant's arguments are detailed in the analysis below.\nThe Appellant's exit from China\n[9] The Appellant argues that the RPD's error arises from two assumptions underpinning its findings which are not dealt with in its reasons. First, the Appellant submits that no summons was issued and the RPD assumed that the PSB's interest in him would translate into a nationwide alert that would have caused the authorities at the border to detect that he was attempting to depart the country. In the absence of prima facie evidence of a summons or arrest warrant, the RPD's assumption that the Appellant would be registered in the database as a person of interest was based on speculation. Second, given the evidence of corruption in China and the Appellant's evidence that he used a smuggler to circumvent the government's border controls, the RPD failed to properly account for evidence that indicates smugglers conspire with border officials to facilitate the entry and exit of contraband, including humans.\n[10] I am persuaded by the Appellant and find that the RPD erred based on the second of the two assumptions argued. Given the Appellant's testimony that the smuggler paid money to assist in the Appellant's departure from China,2 and given the country conditions evidence that corruption and bribery of government officials is a problem in China,3 I find that the RPD erred in failing to account for this evidence in its analysis.\n[11] In my independent assessment of the record, I find that, based on the country conditions evidence, the Appellant's ability to exit from China using his own genuine passport, and the assistance he received from a smuggler, there is insufficient evidence to find that he is not of interest to Chinese authorities. I therefore find that the RPD's finding on this point cannot stand.\nThe Appellant's Falun Gong Identity\n[12] The RPD:\n(a) drew a negative credibility inference because the Appellant was unable to articulate the occasion for a parade he attended as part of his Falun Gong activities in Canada; the Appellant was unable to give details of what he studied despite his testimony that his Falun Gong activities included studying Falun Gong, and the RPD found that someone who had been practicing since February 2017 would be able to answer the RPD's questions;\n(b) drew a negative credibility inference concerning the authenticity of the Appellant's Falun Gong practice because he did not understand the reason or the method for sending righteous thoughts, though he testified that he had read two Falun Gong books and did send forth righteous thoughts;\n(c) found, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant did not know the purposes of the exercises other than exercise two and drew a negative credibility inference regarding the Appellant's assertion that he is a committed Falun Gong practitioner and that he had been practicing for over three years;\n(d) drew a negative credibility inference from the Appellant's inability to correctly articulate the three main principles of Falun Gong, given his testimony that he had studied and practiced Falun Gong for three years; and\n(e) found that the Appellant did not demonstrate a level of knowledge commensurate with the amount of time he alleged to have been practicing Falun Gong. The RPD acknowledged that the Appellant was nervous but noted that he was unable to answer even the most basic questions about Falun Gong. The RPD drew a negative credibility inference and found, on balance, that the Appellant was not a Falun Gong practitioner in China and that he is not practicing Falun Gong in Canada.\n[13] The Appellant concedes that he had some difficulty in responding to the RPD's questions about Falun Gong; however, he submits that he was able to respond to many related questions from his own Counsel. The Appellant submits that the RPD could have observed his difficulty was not his inability to answer but the paralysis that overcame him due to the process. He submits that the RPD erred by failing to adequately consider how his nerves could be a significant inhibiting factor. He also submits that the RPD erred by failing to consider whether he is perceived as a Falun Gong practitioner by virtue of his association with other practitioners.\n[14] I reject the Appellant's arguments and find that the RPD did not err.\n[15] In assessing the Appellant's testimony, I have kept in mind that the Federal Court has stated that claimants can be questioned about their religious knowledge, not to determine the \"theological soundness\" of their answers or as a test on religious trivia, but in order to determine the genuineness of the beliefs they allege.4 The decision-maker, in assessing the genuineness of the beliefs, can consider \"...whether the claimant holds a level of religious knowledge that would be expected of someone in the claimant's position...\"5 Keeping in mind that the Appellant has limited formal education, I find that his testimony does not reflect what he might reasonably be expected to know as a genuine, committed Falun Gong practitioner who had been practicing regularly since 2017, and including since 2018 in Canada.\n[16] Though the Appellant testified that he was nervous, which was considered by the RPD,6 there is no medical evidence on record regarding the Appellant's mental health and whether it impacted upon his testimony.\n[17] Based on my independent assessment of the record, I do not find that the Appellant's nervousness is a reasonable explanation for his testimony. At the time of the hearing, he had allegedly been practicing Falun Gong for over three years, including over two years in Canada. He was able to answer some questions correctly, such as the purpose of exercise two, some basic information about other exercises,7 and the meaning of karma.8 However, there were far more questions that he was unable to answer. In addition to those assessed by the RPD, the Appellant did not know how practitioners get rid of karma, which is another important teaching in Falun Gong.9 In my view, assessing the genuineness of the Appellant's Falun Gong identity is not only based on whether he answered correctly to more questions than not. I am also considering the types of questions he was unable to answer. In his case, he was unable to answer several very basic questions about Falun Gong's central teachings, such as the three main principles, the reason or the method for sending forth righteous thoughts, and how to get rid of karma. I agree with the RPD's assessment that an individual who had allegedly been practicing Falun Gong for over three years would have been able to answer these questions despite being nervous.\n[18] Though Falun Gong is a knowledge-based practice, it is also a way of life. I find that, if the Appellant had actually been a committed practitioner for over three years, he would have been able to answer the basic questions from the RPD and his Counsel irrespective of his nervousness, on a balance of probabilities. Moreover, the Appellant had been informed at the start of the hearing that he could have requested a break; however, he did not do so. I therefore reject his submission that \"paralysis overcame him due to the process.\" Instead, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant memorized some information for the purpose of his refugee claim, which he then had difficulty recalling during the hearing. This is confirmed in his testimony when he stated that he could not \"recall those things I have learned about Falun Gong.\"10\n[19] Therefore, based on the above, I do not find that the RPD erred in considering how the Appellant's nerves impacted his testimony. I further find that the Appellant did not demonstrate a level of knowledge commensurate with the amount of time he alleged to have been practicing Falun Gong.\n[20] I find that, on a balance of probabilities, the above-noted negative credibility findings, taken cumulatively, lead to the conclusion that the Appellant's knowledge is inadequate to demonstrate that he was\/is a sincere Falun Gong practitioner in China or Canada.\n[21] Therefore, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant was not a Falun Gong practitioner in China and that he is not a genuine Falun Gong practitioner in Canada.\n[22] Turning to the second part of the Appellant's argument, I am persuaded that the RPD erred by failing to consider whether he is perceived as a Falun Gong practitioner by virtue of his association with other practitioners. I consider this issue further below.\nThe Appellant's friend's Detention Notice\n[23] The Appellant alleged that he was introduced to Falun Gong by his friend, Mr. XXXX XXXX.11 The Appellant also submitted Mr. XXXX Detention Notice.12\n[24] Although the RPD did not make any findings on this document, I have concerns about its authenticity, and therefore, too, the Appellant's credibility. I also note that the Federal Court has determined that the RAD is not required to give an appellant notice of inconsistencies in their own documents. They are reasonably expected to be aware of the contents of the documents that they themselves provided.13\n[25] I have three concerns with this document. First, it refers to Mr. XXXX as a female. Second, there is no address provided for the detention centre, which is meant to be included.14 Third, the document cites \"Article 91 of the Criminal Procedure Law of People' Republic of China [sic];\"15 however, that Article does not seem to be relevant to the document and scenario.\n[26] Article 91 states:\nWhere public security organs feel that a person in custody needs to be arrested, they shall submit it to the people's procuratorate for review to approve arrest within 3 days of taking the person into custody. In special circumstances the time for submitting for review for approval of arrest may be extended by 1-4 days.\nThe time for submitting for review for approval of arrest may be extended to 30 days for those suspected of committing crimes across multiple regions, committing multiple crimes, or cases of gang crimes.\nThe people's procuratorate shall issue a decision to approve arrest or not approve within 7 days of having received an arrest certificate submitted for approval by a public security organ. Where the people's procuratorate does not approve arrest, the public security organ shall immediately release the suspect upon receiving notification, and promptly notify the people's procuratorate of the enforcement circumstances. Where it is necessary to continue investigation and the requirements for release on guarantee pending further investigation or residential surveillance are met, they should be released on guarantee or put under residential surveillance in accordance with law.16\n[27] I also note that, although not all of the samples in the National Documentation Package (NDP) refer to a particular article number, three documents titled \"NOTICE OF DETENTION\" refer to Article 80 of the Criminal Procedure Act of the People's Republic of China.17\n[28] Article 80 states: \"Arrest of suspects or defendants must be decided upon by a people's procuratorate or people's court and will be enforced by public security organs.\"18\n[29] In my assessment, Article 80 appears to be more relevant as it grants the PSB the jurisdiction to detain.\n[30] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that a genuine and official document would not contain these errors.\n[31] The errors I have noted, on their own, may not support a finding that the document is not genuine. Yet, the Federal Court has recognized that differences in small or microscopic details may be the way that a forgery is exposed. Whether those small differences are sufficient to conclude that a document is not authentic will depend on the facts of each case.19\n[32] When the errors are viewed together with the RPD's findings, which I have upheld, and the widespread availability of fraudulent documents in China,20 I find, on a balance of probabilities, that there is a sufficient basis to find that the Appellant's friend's Detention Notice is not genuine.\n[33] The Appellant's submission of a fraudulent document to support his claim leads me to conclude, on a balance of probabilities, that he is not credible overall, that he is not a bona fide Falun Gong practitioner, and that he is not wanted by the PSB.\nThe Appellant's Sur Place Claim and his Falun Gong activities in Canada\n[34] The RPD noted the Appellant's testimony that he practiced Falun Gong and attended a parade in Canada. The RPD awarded no weight to the letters from fellow practitioners,21 which claim that the Appellant is a \"real\" practitioner, because the letters are not sworn, the authors did not testify, and the letters could have been written by anyone from anywhere. The RPD found, on a balance of probabilities, that owing to the credibility concerns, the Appellant engaged in Falun Gong activities in Canada for the purposes of bolstering a refugee claim and not because he is a genuinely committed Falun Gong practitioner. The RPD also found, on a balance of probabilities, that if the Appellant is practicing Falun Gong in Canada, this has not come to the attention of Chinese authorities.\n[35] The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in failing to give any weight to the letters. He submits that, while a sworn statement and the production of a witness may carry more weight than the unsworn letters, the failure to provide these does not mean that the letters should have been given no weight. The Appellant also submits that the RPD erred by failing to consider the content of the letters. The Appellant argues that the RPD also erred in initially concluding that he was not practicing Falun Gong in Canada, then later concluding that he had practiced but that his practice is not genuine. He submits that, where the RPD has made two contradictory findings, the finding that is favourable to him must be preferred; thus, the RPD's finding that he does not practice Falun Gong is in error and must be completely disregarded. The Appellant also submits that the RPD erred in its sur place analysis by misapprehending the law and creating an erroneous evidentiary burden on him, as a successful sur place claim does not require that he demonstrate that his activities in Canada have come to the attention of the authorities in China.\n[36] I am persuaded by the Appellant and find that the RPD erred in its analysis of the letters and in its sur place assessment. Based on my own independent assessment of the record, I find that I am able to make a determination on both of these issues.\n[37] With regard to the letters, I first note that they are very similar. The first is dated October 10, 2019 and is written by XXXX, XXXX. The second is dated October 10, 2020 and is written by XXXX, XXXX, although his first name appears to be misspelled as \"XXXX\" in the body of the letter. Both letters contain the same phone number for the author. The content of both letters is quite similar. Therefore, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the letters were written by the same individual.\n[38] I find that the RPD erred in failing to award any weight to the letters. The letters purport to corroborate that the Appellant practices Falun Gong in Canada. I find that the letters merit some weight in corroborating the Appellant's allegations. However, given my cumulative credibility findings above, I find that the weight given to the letters, as well as the Appellant's photographs,22 is insufficient to overcome or outweigh the credibility findings.\n[39] With regard to the Appellant's sur place claim, I note that the Federal Court has held that the Board must be allowed to import its credibility findings when considering the sur place aspect of a claim and that it is permissible to assess an appellant's genuineness and sur place claim in light of credibility concerns relating to the original authenticity of a claim.23\n[40] On this basis and having found that the Appellant submitted a fraudulent document and failed to establish his Falun Gong identity, on a balance of probabilities, I import these findings into my sur place analysis. I find that the Appellant failed to establish a sur place claim, as there is no persuasive evidence that his Falun Gong activities in Canada have or would come to the attention of Chinese authorities or that he would be perceived to be a genuine practitioner upon his return to China. I further concur with the RPD that, on a balance of probabilities, the Appellant engaged in Falun Gong activities in Canada for the purposes of bolstering a refugee claim and not because he is a genuinely committed Falun Gong practitioner, and I find that he would not practice Falun Gong upon return to China, on a balance of probabilities.\n[41] Lastly, with regard to whether the Appellant would be perceived as a Falun Gong practitioner by virtue of his association with other practitioners, I do not find that this has been established. I have not found the Appellant credible overall, nor do I find that he has established his allegations. Although he testified to practicing in Canada, attending a parade, and although there is a letter from one individual who allegedly practices with the Appellant, and some photographs with other individuals, there is no evidence that the Chinese authorities have or would become aware of any of this evidence. Therefore, I find that there is no persuasive evidence that the Appellant would be perceived as a Falun Gong practitioner by virtue of his alleged association with other practitioners.\nCONCLUSION\n[42] For the above reasons, and after conducting its own analysis of the record, the RAD finds that the RPD did not err in rejecting the Appellant's claim. The RAD finds that the Appellant has not established his allegations, on a balance of probabilities. As a result, the RAD finds that he has not established that he faces more than a mere possibility of persecution, as per section 96, or that he faces harm, on a balance of probabilities, under section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).24 Therefore, the RPD's final determination that the Appellant is not a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection is correct, and this appeal is dismissed.\n[43] The RAD dismisses the appeal and confirms the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection, pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the IRPA.\n(signed)\nInderpreet K.

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX (Appellant), a citizen of China, appeals a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD), dated April 24, 2019, rejecting his claim for refugee protection.\nDECISION\n[2] The appeal is allowed. I substitute my own decision that the Appellant is a Convention refugee.\nBACKGROUND\n[3] The Appellant alleged before the RPD that he feared returning to China because he would be detained again, given that he previously refused to accept the government's compensation offer for the expropriation of his property.\n[4] The Appellant's application for refugee protection was heard on March 26, 2019. By a decision of April 24, 2019, the RPD rejected the claim. The RPD found that the determinative issue was the objective basis of the risk feared by the Appellant.\n[5] The Appellant submits that the RPD erred by breaching natural justice and procedural fairness, erred in its assessment of the objective basis, and erred by failing to consider relevant evidence.\nROLE OF THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION (RAD)\n[6] My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision.1\nANALYSIS\nThe Appellant has established a serious possibility of persecution\n[7] The RPD found the Appellant's allegations to be credible and accepted that the government wanted to expropriate his property, that he refused the accept the compensation offered, that he was detained for a period of a week, and that his property was demolished after he left China. The RPD also found that the Appellant's fear of persecution was not objectively well-founded as he would not be considered a political opponent, on a balance of probabilities, and he is not of interest to Chinese authorities. The RPD found that the Appellant's statement that he would be detained because he wants to fight back if he returns to China2 was speculative as the Appellant did not know exactly what he would do and had not formulated a course of action.\n[8] The Appellant argues the RPD erred by denying the Appellant natural justice and procedural fairness by failing to convoke a resumption hearing. As counsel ran out of time at the hearing during his examination of the Appellant, he submitted an affidavit from the Appellant and requested another hearing if the RPD had questions for the Appellant about his affidavit. The Appellant submits the RPD erred by not convening a resumption hearing to examine the Appellant about its concerns about statements made in his affidavit. He argues the RPD was unfairly dismissive of the Appellant's sworn declaration to fight back against the Chinese government authorities and that the RPD denied the Appellant an opportunity to respond to concerns prior to issuing a negative decision, which constitutes a breach of natural justice and procedural fairness. With regard to the objective basis, the Appellant argues any further actions he takes to fight back against the government would be viewed as anti-government by the authorities, and would result in his detention, where physical abuse is known to occur. He also argues his opposition to the demolition of his property without fair and reasonable compensation was also a factor underlying his first detention, and not that it was only due to a scuffle, as decided by the RPD in error.\n[9] I have reviewed the record and conducted an independent assessment of the evidence. I am persuaded by the Appellant's arguments.\n[10] I find the RPD breached the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness by not holding another hearing to question the Appellant about his affidavit.3 The RPD found that given the Appellant had not formulated a course of action, it would be speculative that he would be detained in China. However, had the RPD convened a hearing and given the Appellant an opportunity to respond to its concerns, the RPD may not have made this finding. Though I do not share the RPD's concern that the Appellant had not yet formulated a plan, I find that whether or not the Appellant had a plan is not the point. The breach existed in not giving him an opportunity to respond to the RPD's concern, especially since it was specifically requested by his counsel. Further, considering the Appellant had been detained in the past on the same issue, a future detention as a result of \"fighting back\" is not speculative. Therefore, I find the RPD erred and its decision cannot stand.\n[11] I also find the RPD erred in its assessment of the objective basis of the risk feared by the Appellant. The Appellant has a history of refusing to cooperate with the authorities by repeatedly refusing their compensation offer, which resulted in his detention, all of which the RPD found credible. Information in the National Documentation Package (NDP) and submitted by the Appellant indicates that individuals who seek legal redress or protest state land expropriation often face violence from police or hired thugs, or can find themselves arrested and placed in Re-education Through Labour (RTL) Centres, which is \"a form of 'imprisonment lasting up to 3 years that does not require any legal proceedings,'\" or can be sent to \"'black jails,' where allegations of torture and mistreatment have been documented by human rights organizations.\"4 Further, those who petitioned the government, faced restrictions, harassment, and detention, where they were subjected to violence.5 Based on this evidence and the Appellant's history and intentions, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that he would be viewed as anti-government by the Chinese authorities.\n[12] On the basis of the evidence, the Appellant's circumstances, and in considering that the RPD accepted the Appellant's allegations as credible, I find his risk in China is objectively well-founded. As the assessment of risk is forward-facing, based on the above findings, I find that the Appellant has established a serious possibility of persecution based on his perceived anti-government political opinion.\n[13] I also find that the issues of state protection and Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) are moot as the state is the agent of persecution and I find the Appellant's risk exists all over China.\nCONCLUSION\n[14] The RAD finds that there is a serious possibility that the Appellant would suffer persecution should he return to China because of his perceived anti-government political opinion. For this reason, the RAD cannot uphold the decision of the RPD.\n[15] The appeal is allowed. Pursuant to section 111(1)(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), the RAD sets aside the determination of the RPD and substitutes its own determination that the Appellant is a Convention Refugee.\n(signed)\nInderpreet K.

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] The Principal Appellant, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and the Associate Appellant, her husband XXXX XXXX XXXX, appeal a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) dated April 29, 2019, rejecting their claims for refugee protection. The Appellants ask the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) to substitute a finding that they are Convention refugees or persons in need of protection, or refer the matter back to the RPD for redetermination.1\nDETERMINATION\n[2] Pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA),2 I am setting aside the decision of the RPD and substituting it with my own decision. Specifically, on the evidence before me, I find that the Principal Appellant is a Convention refugee and the Associate Appellant is a person in need of protection.\nBACKGROUND\n[3] The Appellants fear returning to Nigeria as the Principal Appellant has avoided female genital mutilation (FGM) for many years and believes that upon her return, her immediate family consisting of her mother, grand-mother, and aunties, along with the larger community, will force her to undergo the rituals. The Principal Appellant along with her husband allege having moved and hid from her agents of persecution numerous times over the years in Nigeria, each time being located and threatened with harm or harmed. The husband has been assaulted as the agents of persecution blame him for not bringing forward his wife for the procedure, one he opposes as he views it as barbaric. The Appellants fled to the USA in late 2017 and eventually made their way to Canada in XXXX 2018, where they initiated claims for refugee protection.\nROLE OF RAD\n[4] In circumstances where the RAD determines that the RPD had a meaningful advantage in assessing the credibility of oral testimony, I may defer to the RPD findings. 3 In this case, I find that the RPD did not benefit from a meaningful advantage in any manner in assessing the Appellant's evidence. As such, I have considered the RPD's findings on the correctness standard.\nNO NEW EVIDENCE AND NO ORAL HEARING\n[5] The Appellants have not stated anywhere in their memorandum that they wish to have new evidence entered for the purposes of this appeal despite both of them submitting affidavits, parts of which address the alleged errors of the RPD. They have not explained, as it is their obligation to do so pursuant to RAD Rule 3(d)(i), that they are relying on new evidence nor have they explained how this new evidence meets the requirements of section 110(4) of IRPA to be admitted. As a result, I decline to admit the affidavits as new evidence. Given the lack of admissible new evidence, I must proceed without holding an oral hearing.\nANALYSIS\n[6] While the RPD raised some credibility concerns relating to a possible lack of subjective fear, the RPD was clear that the determinative issue in this case was the availability of an internal flight alternative (IFA) to either Benin City or Port Harcourt.4\n[7] The Appellants argue that the RPD made errors in its credibility assessments as well as the IFA analysis and findings. Specifically, it is argued that the Appellants have discharged their burden of establishing that the proposed IFA's are unreasonable under both IFA prongs.5\nThe RPD Did Not Err Re: Credibility Findings\n[8] As part of its analysis, the RPD found certain actions of the Appellants' undermined their subjective fear.\nAppellants Attend Traditional Marriage Ceremony and Mother Attends Church Ceremony\n[9] The RPD found that the invitation of the Principal Appellant's mother to her own church wedding in XXXX 2012, after she was already aware of her mother's intention to have her undergo FGM and after attending and escaping from the mother's village after the traditional wedding in XXXX 2012 in order to avoid the FGM ritual, undermined the Appellants' subjective fear. The RPD was of the view it would be reasonable to expect the Appellants to avoid the Principal Appellant's mother as she was one of the agents of persecution.\n[10] The Appellant argues that the RPD misconstrued the evidence as the Principal Appellant's mother was not the main agent of persecution and while her mother informed her of the intended FGM in 2009, she was not \"hell bent\" on the Appellant undergoing the process at that time.6\n[11] I have independently reviewed the evidence and I find no errors in the RPD's analysis or findings. I agree that, given the mother's stated intentions in 2009 to have the Principal Appellant undergo FGM after her traditional marriage, it would be reasonable to expect the Appellants to avoid the traditional ceremony in XXXX 2012 given the associated risk of FGM. Similarly, I agree with the RPD that after literally escaping the FGM ritual in XXXX 2012 and fleeing her mother's village, it is indicative of a lack of subjective fear for the Appellants to then invite her mother to her church wedding ceremony. The Principal Appellant testified that this was done as her siblings wanted close family members to attend so that the Principal Appellant's husband's family would respect her.7 I reject this explanation as it would be reasonable to expect her to prioritize her personal safety and not invite the agent of harm to her wedding given her mother's stated intention to have her undergo FGM even if that somehow disrespected her husband's family, especially in light of her husband's staunch support opposing FGM.\nFailure to Claim Asylum in the USA\n[12] The RPD found the Appellants' explanation for failing to claim asylum in the United States insufficient. Specifically, while acknowledging the Appellants spoke to a lawyer who advised them it may not be beneficial to claim asylum in the USA, the RPD found that there was no evidence the United States did not permit hearings of asylum claims and noted the country is a signatory to the 1951 Convention.\n[13] The Appellants make a legal argument that the RPD failed to consider the provisions of Regulation 159.5 of IRPA, which refers to eligibility criteria for those who have family members in Canada. More accurately, it does not make one ineligible to make a claim under section 101 of the IRPA if that individual has a family member in Canada. It is argued that this exempted the Appellants from the \"safe third country agreement and [they] were not under any legal obligation to make an asylum claim in the US\".8\n[14] With respect, I reject the Appellant's argument as it confuses eligibility to make a refugee claim with the refugee law principle that an individual ought to claim asylum in the first safe country they arrive in, subject to certain conditions of course. While it is true the Principal Appellant's husband has a brother in Canada, the Appellants intention was not initially to come to Canada from the United States because of the family connection. They also had family in the USA as they resided with the husband's sister for 4 months and it was only after seeing videos on YouTube about Canada accepting refugees that they decided to come here to make a claim.9\n[15] Furthermore, the Appellants' stay in the USA was not brief in the sense of simply transiting or sojourning through the USA on their way to Canada. As pointed out by the RPD, the USA is a signatory to the Convention and there is no evidence that they stopped processing asylum claims at any point while the Appellants were there. Having said that, the Appellants' stay was not egregious or exceptional as to find it determinative of their claim, but the failure to claim in the USA does indicate some lack of subjective fear.\n[16] In summary, much like the RPD, I too find these actions undermine to some degree the Appellants' subjective fear and credibility. I note, however, that while finding some concerns with their actions, the RPD did not reject the claim on the basis of credibility but rather, as mentioned above, on the basis of a viable IFA. Specifically, the RPD found the Principal Appellant's fears of her family's capacity to find her to be speculative.\nInternal Flight Alternative to Port Harcourt or Benin City - 1st Prong Analysis\nDo the Appellants Face A Serious Possibility of Persecution or a Risk to Life in the Proposed IFAs?\n[17] The RPD found that despite the Appellant's allegation that they have been found and persecuted in at least three different locations in Nigeria, they have failed to provide sufficient evidence that the family members who are the agents of persecution have the capacity to find the Appellants in Port Harcourt or Benin City. The RPD went on to consider the size and populous of Nigeria generally, the multilingual and multiethnic characteristics and significant populous of Port Harcourt and Benin City, and also considered the Appellant's personal circumstances, concluding that the Appellants \"may be able to safely establish themselves\" in these locations.10\n[18] The Appellants argue that they have already attempted to seek refuge in various regions of Nigeria without success. The Appellants, having been located, threatened and even harmed in various parts of Nigeria far from the agents of persecution, are not expected to continue to relocate, especially to the proposed IFA locations in the southern parts of Nigeria that are in close proximity to Akwa Ibom state where the agents of persecution are located. Finally, it is argued that if the Appellants were to relocate to the proposed IFA locations, they would have to go into hiding and by doing so they can not be considered safe.\n[19] I have independently reviewed the evidence, I agree with the Appellants. They have provided written evidence, as well as testimony, of having relocated numerous times within Nigeria and to numerous locations for various durations, all of which proved futile as they were located by those acting on behalf of the agents of persecution from the community. Specifically, the Appellant's evidence was that due to the constant threats they faced, they moved: to the northern region of Nigeria to Kaduna state in 2014 where they were located by three individuals from the Principal Appellant's home community who gave them an ultimatum to return to the village for the FGM ritual or they would return and forcibly take the Principal Appellant for the procedure;11 relocated to the capital city of Abuja but were located within one month, threatened, and the Appellant's husband was beaten by a group of people who blamed him for not allowing his wife to conduct the ritual, so much so that he spent a week in hospital;12 they moved to Ibadan and continued to receive threats which they reported to police;13 and were ambushed and there was an attempt to kidnap the Principal Appellant in XXXX 2016 by men she recognized from her mother's community.14\n[20] It must be noted that many of these incidents were reported to local police and the police extracts have also been provided by the Appellants.15 Further, this evidence, both documentary and testimonial, was either not considered by the RPD, or was considered but the RPD did not explain what weight, if any, was given to this evidence. What is clear is that the RPD did not make any negative credibility findings regarding these incidents. Given sworn testimony is presumed to be true and no negative findings were made in respect to the documentary evidence presented, I find that these various incidents occurred as alleged and I give this evidence significant weight. Moreover, this is evidence of the Appellants' efforts to relocate and being found and harmed by the agents of persecution. While the Appellants are unable to explain how they were found, in my respectful view, it is not incumbent upon them to know the tactics or processes utilized by their agents of harm to locate them throughout Nigeria.\n[21] Finally, given the Appellants' relocations far from the location of the agents of persecution, to northern, central, and western Nigeria proved fruitless in avoiding further threats and harm, I agree with them that the only way that they may be able to avoid future harm is to live in hiding. As pointed out by the Appellants, living in hiding does not equate to a safe or viable IFA location, and it is even questionable that this would be effective given the prior history of the agents of harm finding the Appellants after they relocated.\n[22] As a result, for the above stated reasons, I find that the Appellants have met their burden and established that they face a serious possibility of persecution or risk to life throughout Nigeria. As the IFA test is disjunctive, I will not consider the 2nd prong of IFA analysis.\nNo State Protection Available to the Appellants in Nigeria\n[23] The objective documentary evidence indicates that there are essentially no successful prosecutions of those who engage in FGM, despite national legislation banning the practice some years ago.16 The Violence Against Persons Prohibition (VAPP) is not enforced and many individuals, including local police, do not know or have a good understanding of the legislation, with still a lot of work being undertaken by NGO's to educate the public and law enforcement officials against the practice of FGM as it is largely viewed as a family customary or traditional issue which the police do not wish to get involved in.17\n[24] The Appellants' experience is very similar, as when they approached the police for help, the police seemed uninterested as this was a domestic family matter involving tradition.18 Also, corruption is still a significant issue in Nigeria and endemic in many aspects of governance, and the Nigerian police force is not immune to this societal issue.19 Similarly, the Appellants were told by the police that they could not protect them, however, for a significant bribe, the police would assign them an officer for their personal security.20\n[25] In my view, in a country with police corruption and bribery commonplace, and where the attitudes of law enforcement regarding FGM is to view it as a family or traditional matter not to be interfered with, I do not believe the Appellants can obtain adequate state protection.\n[26] In summary, I find that the Principal Appellant has established a serious possibility of persecution. In my view, the Principal Appellant would be subjected to FGM at the hands of her mother and those from her mother's community who believe she must undergo the FGM rites. I find her nexus to a Convention ground to be that of a member of a particular social group, specifically a woman facing gender-related persecution. I do not find a nexus to a Convention ground for the Principal Appellant's husband, XXXX XXXX XXXX. However, I find based on his experiences of being threatened with death and beaten due to his opposition to his wife undergoing FGM and the ongoing threat from the agents of persecution, that he has established on a balance of probabilities that he faces a risk to his life from the Principal Appellant's family members and community. As such, I find him to be a person in need of protection.\nCONCLUSION\n[27] The RAD, pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(b) of the IRPA, sets aside the decision of the RPD and substitutes a decision that the Principal Appellant is a Convention refugee and the Associate Appellant is a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\n\"Christopher Marcinkiewicz\"\nChristopher Marcinkiewicz\nJune 19, 2020\nDate\n5Exhibit P-2, Appellant's Record, Appellant's Memorandum, p. 13, paras. 33-34.\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD.25.02 (January, 2020)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\nImmigration and Refugee\nBoard of Canada\nRefugee Appeal Division\nCommission de l'immigration\net du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 du Canada\nSection d'appel des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s\nRAD.25.02 (January, 2020)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] These are my reasons for allowing the appeal of XXXX XXXX XXXX (the \"appellant\") of Zimbabwe from a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (the \"RPD\") to reject his claim for refugee protection. The appellant claims to face persecution, a danger of torture, a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment if he returns to Zimbabwe.\n[2] Pursuant to subsection 111(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the \"IRPA\"),1 the RAD sets aside the RPD's determination and refers the matter to a differently constituted RPD panel. The appeal is allowed.\n[3] The determinative issues in this case are whether the RPD erred in its credibility findings or whether there has been a breach of procedural fairness.\nBACKGROUND\n[4] The appellant fears persecution and harm in Zimbabwe on the basis of his political opinion as a member and supporter of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC).\n[5] In XXXX 2014 the appellant was interrogated and beaten following a police raid on a church with links to the MDC. In XXXX 2016 the appellant's family home was raided and threats were made against the appellant. The appellant was again arrested in XXXX 2016 during protests against the government political party but the appellant was able to escape custody. Following this incident the appellant left Zimbabwe for South Africa and travelled onward to Canada in XXXX 2016 when he made a claim for refugee protection.\nNEW EVIDENCE AND ORAL HEARING\n[6] The appellant neither seeks to enter new evidence nor requests an oral hearing in this appeal.\nROLE OF THE RAD\n[7] With respect to questions of fact, mixed fact and law, I have applied the standard of correctness as per Huruglica.2 In assessing issues involving credibility of oral testimony, I have applied the RAD's modified standard of reasonableness.3\nTHE RPD DECISION\n[8] The RPD did not find the appellant's evidence to be overall credible. Specifically the RPD found that:\n(a) the appellant had exhibited an interest in coming to Canada prior to 2016 and that his evidence in regard to his travel history was inconsistent;\n(b) the appellant's evidence in regard to his support and membership in the MDC was inconsistent;\n(c) the appellant's acccount of his escape from authorities was implausible;\n(d) the appellant having a Facebook profile was inconsistent with the behaviour of a fugitive;\n(e) there were contradictions and inconsistencies between the testimonies of the appellant and a witness; and,\n(f) the appellant is neither a Convention4 refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nAPPELLANT'S ARGUMENTS\n[9] In his memorandum of argument the appellant:\n(a) attacks the conclusions in the RPD's assessment of the refugee claim;\n(b) asserts that the RPD erred in regard to its treatment of the evidence; and,\n(c) asserts there has been a breach in the appellant's right to procedural fairness.\n[10] I will address the appellant's arguments in my analysis below.\nRAD ANALYSIS\n[11] In this appeal, I find that the RPD did not have any real advantage in assessing the credibility that would lead to deference to its finding regarding it. The RPD does not state that there were any difficulties with the appellant's testimony where the RPD would have been in a better position than the RAD to judge it.\n[12] In my independent analysis after reviewing the entirety of the record including the audio recording of the hearing, I find there are critical errors in the RPD decision that leads me to the conclusion that the decision must be set aside. Given the import of these errors it is not necessary for me to address all of the credibility concerns raised in the RPD reasons for decision. Therefore, I will only be dealing with the following issues that I find determinative of the appeal.\nDid the RPD err in making plausibility findings?\n[13] The appellant is entitled to the presumption of truthfulness;5 before the RPD can impeach a claimant's [appellant's] credibility, it must set out its concerns in clear and unmistakable terms. The need for clear reasons is particularly important when the RPD makes findings of implausibility; the panel must clearly articulate why the evidence is outside the realm of what could reasonably be expected in the specific circumstances.6\n[14] Implausibility findings should be made only in the clearest of cases. The RPD must be careful in rendering a decision on implausibility because refugee claimants come from diverse cultures, and actions that might appear implausible when judged from Canadian standards might be plausible in the refugee claimant's milieu.7\n[15] The RPD did not believe the claimant's [appellant's] evidence that he simply walked out of a police station without being re-apprehended because the station was so busy with many arrested demonstrators. In its reasons for decision the panel stated that, \"I find the claimant's description of an effortless escape from the police to lack plausibility.\"8\n[16] In reviewing the audio recording of the hearing9 the appellant described quite spontaneously and in some detail, the circumstances of his being able to simply walk out of the station. He stated that the police holding cells were full and that detainees from the rally were kept sitting on the floor in offices. The appellant went on to explain that because he was dressed more formally than the detained demonstrators, although his shoes and belt had been confiscated, he thought he could walk out of the station undetected and that he was successful in doing so. I do not find this explanation implausible and I find that the RPD has failed to explain why it disbelieved the appellant's account.\n[17] The RPD did not dispute the account of the appellant in regard to this incident when it was described at the hearing. In this case the RPD concluded, without evidentiary basis, that it would be implausible for someone, without shoes or a belt, to walk out of a police station unnoticed by authorities. I find no basis in the evidence for this conclusion.\n[18] The Federal Court has stated that plausibility findings should be made where the facts are so far outside the realm of what could reasonably be expected that it could not happen as described, or where there is documentary evidence or other evidence that demonstrates that events could not have happened as described.10 In my independent assessment of this evidence, including a review of the hearing audio-tape, I do not find the description of events by the appellant at the hearing could not have reasonably occurred as he stated. The police station was full of detainees from the rally and it is reasonable to assume that police would be both highly occupied and distracted when the appellant simply walked out the door.\n[19] This RPD plausibility finding was important to the overall credibility assessment of the RPD because it impugns the entirety of the appellant's evidence in regard to his fears that the police and or the Zimbawe African National Union - Patriotic Front (ZANU - PF) are searching for him and would harm him if he returned to Zimbabwe. I find that the RPD has unjustifiably doubted the truthfulness of the appellant's assertions of facts that remain without inherent contradiction.11 I also find the RPD erred in not establishing a persuasive evidentiary basis, or providing an adequate explanation for making this particular plausibility finding.\n[20] The RPD also concluded that the appellant had not \"reasonably explained\"12 why he would have a Facebook page updated to his location in Canada when he was a fugitive from Zimbabwe who's security authorities could learn of his whereabouts. While in this instance the RPD did not use the word \"plausibility,\" in my view this is another plausibility finding based on the RPD's assumption that a fugitive in one country would not engage in social media activities in another country. Again, there is simply no basis in the evidence for this implausibility finding. The RPD failed to explain why it concluded that the appellant, if he genuinely feared for his life would not engage in social media exchanges. In this case the social media exchanges were neither political nor anti-government in nature. As the appellant has noted in his Memorandum of Argument,13 he felt safe in Canada and his whereabouts did not constitute a risk from authorities in Zimbabwe. The RPD did not refer to any objective evidence about whether the authorities in Zimbabwe monitor Facebook or other social media communications outside the country, and simply appears to have made this finding on the basis of its own view of how an appellant should behave in these circumstances. This too was an unreasonable finding.\nDid the RPD err in its assessment of the evidence?\n[21] The appellant claimed that he fears persecution because he is a supporter and member of the MDC; that he had been arrested and escaped from authorities and; that he had a previous record of arrest that would have brought him to the attention of authorities. He further claims that ZANU - PF and other authorities came to his family home.\n[22] In his witness testimony by phone, the appellant's father was asked to verify a number of the appellant's allegations including the visit of police and ZANU - PF activists to the family home. While the witness confirmed critical evidence provided by the appellant in regard to his political activity and the assault he suffered from ZANU - PF thugs, he referred to dates in regard to vandalism by ZANU - PF on the family home and the appellant's departure from Zimbabwe that were different, by one month, than the date submitted by appellant.\n[23] In listening to the audio recording of this exchange14 I find that there were serious difficulties in the establishment of a clear telephonic connection with the witness. In addition in the questioning of the appellant by his counsel and in the submissions of the appellant's counsel at the hearing15 it is noted that the appellant's father is elderly and can forget details.\n[24] The appellant points out that the contradiction in dates was not brought to the appellant's attention at the RPD hearing. Consequently, there was no opportunity for the appellant to explain why the witness testified to events happening on a different date than the date that was provided by the appellant. The appellant argues this was a breach of procedural fairness.\n[25] There is a general duty for the RPD to confront a claimant with inconsistencies and give them an opportunity to respond.16 Whether or not the inconsistency must be explicitly put to the claimant depends on the facts of each case.17 The Federal Court has held that the duty of fairness does not require a panel to \"alert a claimant to a potentially adverse credibility finding in every case or in matters of trivial importance.\"18\n[26] In my independent assessment of the evidence in this case, I find this was a situation where the appellant should have been given an opportunity to respond to the inconsistency. This was not a matter of trivial importance. The RPD found that the appellant was not credible and concluded that the evidence of the witness further undermined the credibility of the appellant's evidence. As the appellant pointed out on appeal, there could be an explanation for the inconsistency but the appellant was never given an opportunity to provide it. Perhaps the witness\nwas confused or did not think the detail of the date was important. These might or might not be sufficient explanations - but in the particular circumstances of this case, any such explanations should have been solicited, considered and weighed by the RPD.\n[27] Although it was not the only inconsistency found, the RPD's credibility finding with respect to this contradiction in the evidence was significant to the determination of the appellant's refugee claim. The RPD found that the appellant's father had contradicted the appellant's evidence in regard to the dates he left Zimbabwe and when his family home was attacked. It was also at this point in the RPD reasons19 that the RPD concluded that the appellant was generally lacking in credibility.\n[28] In these circumstances, as in Tanase,20 the duty of fairness is strong. In Ngongo v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] F.C.J. No. 1627 at paragraph 16, the court established a list of factors that should be weighed in determining whether a refugee claimant should be confronted with inconsistencies in his or her testimony before the Immigration and Refugee Board:\nIn my view, regard should be had in each case to the fact situation, the applicable legislation and the nature of the contradictions noted. The following factors may serve as guidelines:\n1. Was the contradiction found after a careful analysis of the transcript or recording of the hearing, or was it obvious?\n2. Was it in answer to a direct question from the panel?\n3. Was it an actual contradiction or just a slip?\n4. Was the applicant represented by counsel, in which case counsel could have questioned him on any contradiction?\n5. Was the applicant communicating through an interpreter? Using an interpreter makes misunderstandings due to interpretation (and thus, contradictions) more likely.\n6. Is the panel's decision based on a single contradiction or on a number of contradictions or implausibilities?\n[29] I find the RPD breached procedural fairness by failing to confront the principal appellant with the inconsistency in the witness testimony and then making a negative credibility finding without considering the appellant's explanation. There were unquestionably some technical problems in regard to the telephone connection and the witness interview was cut short. However, it was open to the RPD to confront the appellant about discrepancies following the witness interview or to reconvene the call if further testimony were required.\n[30] The RPD erred in its treatment of the above noted credibility concerns, and as such the overall credibility determination cannot stand. I must also consider, however, whether this error is fatal to the determination of the appellant's refugee claim.\n[31] The appellant was denied procedural fairness when the RPD failed to confront the appellant with a significant inconsistency. The RPD also made two findings based on unsubstantiated plausibility findings. The resulting overall credibility finding permeates the rest of the RPD's decision.\n[32] The RPD made other credibility findings that, as I have noted, are not necessary for me to address given the findings above. It is clear from the RPD's reasons that the implausibility findings I have noted and the lack of evidence and analysis in regard to the witness testimony formed significant parts of the RPD's overall credibility analysis, and key components of its finding with respect to the appellant's fear of authorities in Zimbabwe. Those findings are in error and the RPD's determination must consequently be set aside.\n[33] In this case I am not in a position to substitute my own determination of the appellant's refugee claim. There remain credibility concerns, and the RPD did not undertake an analysis of country conditions or the level of risk to the appellant upon return. Such an analysis might be necessary if the appellant is found to be credible.\nCONCLUSION\n[34] Pursuant to subsection 111(1) of the IRPA, the RAD sets aside the RPD's determination and refers the matter to a differently constituted RPD panel. The appeal is allowed.\n(signed)\n\"Richard Jackson\"\nRichard Jackson\nFebruary 7, 2018\nDate\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SAR :\nRAD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SAR : VB6-04783\nRAD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SAR : VB6-04783\n",

He has submitted no new evidence in support of his appeal. The Appellant asks the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) to set aside the determination of the RPD and either find him to be a Convention refugee or return the matter to the RPD for redetermination.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] Pursuant to section 111(1)(c) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), the RAD refers the matter to the Refugee Protection Division for redetermination by a differently constituted panel.\nBackground\n[3] The Appellant alleged before the RPD that he was and will be persecuted in Azerbaijan because of his support for an opposition political party.\n[4] The Appellant's application for refugee protection was heard on May 13, 2016. By a decision of June 22, 2016, the RPD rejected the claim. The panel cited a number of credibility concerns and determined that the Appellant was generally lacking in credibility.\n[5] The Appellant submits that the RPD erred by ignoring country conditions, misinterpreting evidence, and taking unfounded negative inferences.\nANALYSIS\nThe Role of the RAD\n[6] While the IRPA sets out grounds for appeal as well as possible remedies, it does not specify the standard by which the RAD is to review the decision of the lower tribunal.\n[7] The Appellant submits that it is the role of the RAD to intervene when the RPD is wrong in law, in fact, or in fact and law, and as such correctness is the standard of review. It is his position that the nature and extent of the errors in the RPD's decision leave little room for deference by the RAD.\n[8] It is settled law that the RAD is not to review decisions of the RPD in the manner of a judicial review.1\n[9] The RAD is a creature of statute and so is the appeal before it; its role and jurisdiction are best determined by looking at the legislative provisions creating the RAD and the appeal.2 Such an appeal\n(i) is directed at the decision of the RPD, (ii) unless new evidence is accepted, is to be entertained on the basis of the record as it was constituted at the time of the RPD's decision, and (iii) is to be concerned solely with the errors of law, of fact or of mixed fact and law that, according to the appellant, the RPD made. This is the statutory configuration of an appeal before the RAD.3\n[10] According to the Federal Court of Appeal, the RAD is to carefully consider the RPD's decision and then carry out its own analysis of the record to determine whether, as submitted by the Appellant, the RPD erred. It is then to provide a final determination, either confirming the RPD's decision or setting it aside and substituting the RAD's own determination of the refugee claim. If the RAD cannot provide such a final determination without hearing the oral evidence already presented to the RPD, the matter can be referred back to the RPD.4\n[11] With respect to findings of fact and of mixed fact and law, the RAD is to review the RPD's decision applying a standard of correctness.5 When applying that standard, the RAD will not show deference to the RPD's reasoning process; it will rather undertake its own analysis of the question. The analysis will bring the RAD to decide whether it agrees with the determination of the RPD; if not, the RAD will substitute its own view and provide the correct answer.6\n[12] There are, however, cases where the RPD enjoys a meaningful advantage over the RAD in making findings of fact or mixed fact and law, because such findings require an assessment of the credibility or weight to be given to oral evidence heard by the RPD.7 The Federal Court of Appeal, in discussing the standard of review to be applied by the RAD to the RPD's decision, has declined to provide the scope and degree of deference to be shown by the RAD:\nThe RAD should be given the opportunity to develop its own jurisprudence in that respect; there is thus no need for me to pigeon-hole the RAD to the level of deference owed in each case.8\n[13] While it is clear that some level of deference is warranted, it is less obvious how much deference is owed, and to what findings. As the Federal Court observed in Akuffo:\n[T]here also appears to be a consensus that when no hearing is held before the RAD, the latter owes deference to the RPD's credibility findings. The opinions rather diverge on: i) the level of deference that is owed or its exact definition; and ii) the scope of the questions of fact and questions of mixed fact and law for which deference is owed.9\n[14] The RAD will show deference to the RPD's findings where the RPD was in an advantageous position to reach such conclusions. The RPD's advantage comes from seeing claimants and witnesses and hearing oral testimony. As such, credibility findings arising from that oral testimony are deserving of deference, as are other findings of fact based on oral evidence, as are findings based on the RPD's specialized knowledge of a particular matter where the RAD does not have its own specialized knowledge with respect to the same factual issue. The RPD's advantage may even extend to personal documents in situations where it has questioned the claimant or witness about such documents and where the resulting testimony gives rise to credibility concerns.\n[15] Not every finding relating to credibility warrants deference. Where the RPD has made a finding of implausibility, for example, it has no advantage where the determination of plausibility is based on the RPD's own reasoning, or on objective documents, and does not arise directly from the oral evidence.10 Similarly, where the RPD draws an inference - a credibility finding based on deduction and reasoning, rather than a contradiction in evidence - the RAD may see no reason to show deference, as the appellate tribunal can be expected to have equal expertise in the inferential process.11\n[16] How much deference is owed by the RAD to findings of the RPD? In Huruglica, the Federal Court held that the RAD can\nrecognize and respect the conclusion of the RPD on such issues as credibility and\/or where the RPD enjoys a particular advantage in reaching such a conclusion but it is not restricted, as an appellate court is, to intervening on facts only where there is a \"palpable and overriding error\".12\nThis passage has subsequently been endorsed by other decisions of the Court.\n[17] Although the Court did not explain what level of deference is established by recognizing and respecting a conclusion of the RPD, it has repeatedly upheld decisions in which the RAD applied a reasonableness standard to decisions of the RPD.13 In the RAD's view, this suggests that \"recognize and respect\" is indeed somewhat similar to reasonableness.\n[18] In Dunsmuir, the Supreme Court discussed two elements of a deferential review: process and outcome. 14 Despite the difference between judicial review and a RAD appeal, the RAD finds this framework helpful in considering its own approach to deference.\n[19] Even where the RAD is to show deference to findings of the RPD, those findings must still be the result of a comprehensible reasoning process. The RAD must be able to read the RPD's decision and understand how the RPD's conclusions were reached.\n[20] Further, the outcome of that process must be a result that is based on and supported by the evidence that was before the RPD. For this reason, it is particularly important that the RAD engage in its own review of the evidence in the RPD's record, in order to determine whether the RPD's finding is supported by that evidence.\n[21] The RAD will apply a standard of correctness to its consideration of the RPD's decision: it will conduct its own review of the evidence and undertake its own analysis of the question. If this does not lead the RAD to the same conclusion as the RPD, the RPD's finding is wrong.\n[22] However, the RAD will not interfere with the RPD's findings where such conclusions result from the RPD's distinct advantages or from a comprehensible reasoning process whose premises are rooted in such advantages. If either the process or the outcome does not meet these requirements, the RAD will determine the findings to be in error.\n[23] Having done this, the RAD will provide a final determination, either by confirming the RPD's decision or setting it aside and substituting its own determination. If it cannot do so without hearing oral evidence that was already heard by the RPD, it will refer the matter back for redetermination.\nThe RPD's Findings\n[24] The Appellant argues that the RPD made numerous errors in rejecting his claim for protection.\nEmployment\n[25] The RPD found an evidentiary discrepancy with respect to the Appellant's employment. A medical document from Azerbaijan showed that he had no employment at the time he was treated for an injury; however, he completed immigration forms in Canada which indicated that he was employed in construction during the time of the medical report. The Appellant explained to the RPD that he did not have formal employment but was working for his father. The RPD did not find this explanation satisfactory and found that the evidentiary inconsistency remained unexplained.\n[26] The Appellant argues on appeal that the medical document did not show his employment because he did not have official work. He points out that the RPD provided no reason for rejecting his explanation. The RAD agrees that the RPD's finding here was not clear, and therefore was an error. The Appellant testified that he was not formally employed, and this would appear to explain why the medical document did not list a job; it is not possible to ascertain from the RPD's reasons why the panel did not believe this explanation.\nPolitical Party\n[27] The RPD's reasons suggest that the Appellant had some difficulty in providing the correct name of the political party, which he described in his Basis of Claim narrative as \"the Azerbaijan Popular Front political party....\"15 The RPD noted that, in his testimony, the Appellant called the party the \"Front Party of Azerbaijan\" and the \"Azerbaijan People's Front Party.\" He denied that the party's name included the word \"Popular.\" The RPD drew a negative inference, and was particularly concerned that the Appellant used the word \"People's\" instead of \"Popular.\"16\n[28] Evidence in the RPD's record shows that the party is known as both \"the People's Front of Azerbaijan Party\" and as the \"Azerbaijan Popular Front Party.\"17 Although counsel referred to this evidence in his written submissions to the RPD, the RPD's reasons do not appear to acknowledge or consider this. The RPD erred by making a negative credibility finding with respect to the Appellant's testimony about the party name, as objective evidence establishes that the party is known by different names.\nTime in Hiding\n[29] The RPD found another \"crucial evidentiary discrepancy\" with respect to the Appellant's alleged time in hiding. It noted his evidence that he left his family home in Baku, hid elsewhere in the city, and then spent some time between the house of an aunt and that of a cousin. The RPD found his testimony \"not believable,\" observing that the Appellant's immigration forms indicated that he stayed at his own home during this entire period. The RPD concluded that:\nI am not satisfied that it has been established on a balance of probabilities that the claimant was in hiding. His subjective fear of serious harm at the time, therefore, has not been demonstrated on the balance of probabilities. If the claimant had indeed gone into hiding as alleged, then, in my view, more likely than not, his evidence in this area would have been provided to Canada's immigration and refugee authorities in much more consistent and reliable fashion.18\n[30] The Appellant points out on appeal that he in fact fled the country during the time period in question. After two months of hiding, he went to Russia and remained there for more than a year. His time in Russia was corroborated by a false Russian passport in his name with a genuine U.S. visa issued in Moscow. The U.S. visa, and the Appellant's presence in Moscow, was verified by a biometrics report in the RPD's record.19\n[31] The RPD's analysis, inexplicably, does not seem to take into account the Appellant's travel to Russia. The RPD found that the Appellant had not demonstrated a subjective fear of persecution; it was an error to reach such a conclusion without considering reliable evidence that the Appellant had in fact left the country entirely a short time after the alleged incident.\n[32] Although the Appellant alleges that the RPD made further errors in rejecting his refugee claim, it is not necessary for the RAD to consider these arguments. The RPD's finding that the Appellant lacked credibility was based on a cumulative consideration of his credibility.20 For reasons set out above, the RPD erred in a number of its credibility findings. As such, its cumulative credibility determination cannot stand.\nRequest for an Oral Hearing\n[33] The Appellant asks the RAD to convene an oral hearing to consider his credibility. The RAD must proceed without a hearing unless there is new evidence. The Appellant has not submitted new evidence in support of his appeal and the RAD therefore has no discretion to order an oral hearing.\nCONCLUSION\n[34] Pursuant to section 111(1)(c) of the IRPA, the RAD refers the matter to the Refugee Protection Division for redetermination by a differently constituted panel. This appeal is allowed.\n(signed)\n\"Edward Bosveld\"\nEdward Bosveld\nOctober 17, 2016\nDate\nsee also M.C.I. v. Huruglica, Bujar (F.C.A., no.

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (the appellant) is a citizen of Haiti who alleges that he experienced two incidents in Haiti, in XXXX 2015 and in 2016, which involved the same criminals, who robbed him because he was considered to be wealthy, having travelled outside of Haiti. The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejected the appellant's refugee protection claim because it noted inconsistencies regarding his status in the United States, because he gave contradictory testimony regarding the incidents in 2015 and 2016, because the objective documentary evidence indicates that Haitians returning to Haiti after living abroad do not face any specific risks solely because they are returning to the country, because the appellant never filed a complaint with Haitian authorities for the two incidents in 2015 and 2016, and because his behaviour was inconsistent with that of people who fear for their lives since he did not seek asylum in the United States.\n[2] The appellant argues on appeal that the RPD erred because it did not consider the presumption of the truthfulness of allegations set out in Maldonado, that the appellant's expatriate status was the only reason for the attacks and their repetitive nature, and that the inconsistencies identified with regard to his status in the United States and stays in Haiti are explained by the fact that he destroyed his documents before entering Canada. In addition, the appellant argues that the RPD erred in law in concluding that the personal risk to which the appellant would be subjected should he return to Haiti is part of a generalized risk faced by Haiti's population.\n[3] The Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) concludes that, although the RPD erred in its analysis of the appellant's allegations regarding his status in the United States, it did not err in its analysis or in its findings that the appellant's allegations regarding the incidents he allegedly experienced in Haiti in 2015 and 2016 were not credible.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] The RAD dismisses the appeal. The RPD was correct to determine that the appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nANALYSIS\n[5] The RAD must conduct a probing, thorough, comprehensive and independent review of all the evidence submitted in light of the appellant's arguments on appeal.1 In this case, the RAD listened to the recording and applied the standard of correctness.\nStatus in the United States and stays in Haiti\n[6] The RPD concluded that the appellant failed to establish that he lived in the United States for 14 years and that he travelled to Haiti several times until 2016,2 but the RAD notes that the RPD erred in its analysis for the following reasons.\n[7] The appellant testified that he obtained permanent residence in the United States in XXXX 2003, that he left Haiti at the time to move to the United States, and that he returned to Haiti several times for visits. The appellant explained that his permanent resident status was withdrawn and changed to temporary residence due to tax fraud, and that ultimately, he was required to leave the country after receiving a deportation order. The RPD noted that the appellant did not provide documentary evidence to support his allegations regarding the acquisition and subsequent loss of his status in the United States and his stays in Haiti over the years.3 The RPD also noted that, in his forms, he failed to mention that he had obtained permanent resident status in the United States.4\n[8] However, the RAD notes that the appellant explained that he had ripped up all his documents concerning his status in the United States before arriving in Canada because he did not want to be deported by United States authorities, and that was why he did not provide evidence in that regard. The RPD noted his explanation but did not draw a conclusion on it.5 The RAD considers that the appellant's explanation is sufficient to justify the lack of evidence concerning his status in the United States and that the RPD erred in failing to comment on the appellant's explanations. In the RAD's opinion, although the timeline of his gradual loss of status in the United States was not completely clear, his testimony on when he obtained the status, the fact that he had lost his status in the United States gradually and the reason why he lost it-tax fraud-was consistent. In addition, the RAD notes that, although the appellant did not tick the box in the Schedule A form to declare that he had obtained permanent resident status in the United States, he wrote further down on the same page that his \"Green Card\" was withdrawn by United States authorities.6 He wrote the same thing in the IMM 0008 form.7 Therefore, in the RAD's view, the RPD erred in concluding that the appellant did not establish that he had lived in the United States. The RAD notes that, although there is no evidence apart from his testimony on his status in the United States, the appellant did provide the RPD with a driver's licence issued by the state of Florida in XXXX 2013,8 which indicates that he was in the United States at that time. The same document indicates that the card was replaced on XXXX XXXX, 2015,9 which means that the appellant was in the United States before his alleged trip to Haiti in XXXX 2015, as he stated in his Basis of Claim Form (BOC Form).\n[9] The RAD considers that the RPD erred in concluding that there was no evidence that he returned to the United States after his stay in Haiti ending on XXXX XXXX, 2016. The RAD notes that the appellant was consistent in his immigration forms10 and testimony regarding the fact that he arrived in the United States in XXXX 2003 and that he arrived in Canada via the United States in XXXX 2017. Although there is no United States entry stamp in his passport following his departure from Haiti, his passport indicates that he was in Haiti until XXXX XXXX, 2016, and his consistent statements in his immigration forms confirm that he was in the United States prior to arriving in Canada. These elements demonstrate that the appellant must have returned to the United States after leaving Haiti on XXXX XXXX, 2016, even though the exact date of his return to the United States is not established, and that he subsequently left for Canada in 2017.\nContradictory testimony regarding the time of the 2015 and 2016 incidents\n[10] The RAD agrees with the RPD that the appellant's testimony was contradictory regarding the dates of his trips to Haiti in 2015 and 2016, when he was allegedly attacked by criminals, and that his responses changed.11 The appellant initially stated that he had travelled to Haiti in XXXX 2015 for eight days and that he went to Haiti in XXXX 2016 for eight days. At the request of the RPD, the appellant confirmed that the trip in 2016 had taken place in XXXX, but when the RPD mentioned that it had his passport before it, the appellant stated that his trip to Haiti in 2016 had taken place in XXXX and that the one in 2015 had taken place in XXXX, which contradicts his BOC Form regarding his trip in 2015. When the RPD confronted him with the fact that his new passport had been issued in XXXX 2016 in Port-au-Prince, the appellant again stated that his trip to Haiti in 2016 had taken place in XXXX. Finally, the appellant stated that his trip to Haiti in 2016 had taken place in XXXX, after the RPD explained that he had to have been in Haiti in XXXX 2016, given that his passport had been issued on XXXX XXXX, 2016, and he had obtained the passport in Port-au-Prince, and that he must have left the country on XXXX XXXX, 2016, since his passport contained an exit stamp from Haiti with that date.\n[11] In addition, the appellant stated that his trip in 2016 had only lasted four days because he had to leave the country quickly after being attacked on his way to his aunt's funeral. However, the RPD noted that the appellant stated that he had obtained his passport around XXXX XXXX, 2016, in Port-au-Prince, and that, according to his passport, he left the country on XXXX XXXX, 2016, which was clearly more than four days. When the RPD confronted him with this contradiction with the information in his passport, the appellant initially stated that he had obtained his passport on an urgent basis. He then changed his answer and stated that he had started taking steps to obtain the new passport while he was in Florida, and that he had actually stayed in Haiti for eight days in 2016 and four days in 2015, which contradicted the testimony he gave at the beginning of the hearing. The RAD agrees with the RPD that the timeline provided by the appellant regarding his trips to Haiti in 2015 and 2016 and their duration was inconsistent.\n[12] The RAD notes that the incidents allegedly experienced by the appellant in Haiti during his trips to the country in 2015 and 2016 form the basis of his refugee protection claim. The fact that he was unable to consistently state the date or duration of these trips during which the incidents allegedly occurred undermines the credibility of these allegations. In the RAD's opinion, the appellant's responses were inconsistent and changed as the RPD confronted him with the consistencies. As a result, the RAD concludes that the RPD did not err in drawing a negative credibility inference owing to these inconsistencies.\nReasons he was targeted\n[13] The RAD considers that the RPD did not err in concluding that the appellant did not establish that he had been targeted by criminals in Haiti in 2015 and 2016 because they considered him to be wealthy.12 Although the appellant argues on appeal that the RPD should have considered his particular circumstances-that he had been attacked twice by the same criminals-before concluding that his fear was based on a generalized risk,13 the RAD notes that the RPD did exactly what the appellant is asking. The RPD noted that he stated that he had earned US$XXXX every two weeks and that he had had to seek social assistance in the United States. It asked the appellant if he had interacted with the criminals in any way during the incidents in question, and he answered no. The RPD asked whether his family or friends in Haiti perceived him as being wealthy, or if he, his family or friends had told people in Haiti that he was wealthy, and he answered no to both questions. The appellant explained that he believes the criminals attacked him because they perceived him as being wealthy given that he had returned from abroad. The RPD asked the appellant how the criminals could have known that he had returned from abroad, and he stated that it was possible that someone had informed them. In the RAD's view, the appellant was clearly speculating as to why the criminals targeted him since he had not spoken with them. The RPD noted that the documentation in the National Documentation Package (NDP) on Haiti indicates that a person does not face a specific merely because they have returned to Haiti from abroad, that a person arriving in Haiti from abroad was neither automatically nor systematically targeted, and that people face only if inner circle is aware that they returned from abroad and believe they have a lot of money.14 Since the appellant stated that his family and friends do not consider him wealthy, the RPD concluded that the appellant had not rebutted the contents of the documentary evidence.\n[14] The RAD notes that, since the RPD's decision, the document in the NDP on Haiti that the RPD referred to has been updated. The RAD therefore sent a notice to the appellant inviting him to provide submissions concerning the information in the updated document and the document's implications on his claim.15 However, the appellant did not answer within the required time frame, and, as at the date of this decision, the RAD has not received a response from the appellant.\n[15] The RAD notes that the updated document states that:\n...people returning from abroad are not automatically categorized as such by society in general, because there is no way for their fellow citizens to know that they are returnees, unless there is media coverage; according to him, any [translation] \"indexing\" is only by their inner circle.16\nThe document reports that Haitians who are repatriated or deported to Haiti are often regarded by their fellow citizens as criminals or wrongdoers.17 The document repeats what was in the previous version, namely that \"a person returning to Haiti after having lived abroad for a long time will not necessarily or automatically face risks in Haiti.\"18 However, the RAD notes that, according to another source cited in the updated document, \"Haitians returning to Haiti after a long stay abroad risk being targeted by criminals...because they are considered to be wealthy...or to have access to money because of their foreign connections.\"19 Nevertheless, people still have to know that the individuals have returned from abroad and, as indicated in the updated document, unless their return is covered by the media, their fellow citizens could not know where they have returned from. In addition, the updated document states that \"[s]ome sources have stated that relatives of a returnee could, in some cases, pose a threat to that person whose return deprives them of their former remittances.\"20 However, in this case, the appellant testified that his family and friends in Haiti do not consider him to be wealthy. Finally, the updated document states that the risk that people returning from abroad would be targeted by criminals is \"particularly high in the vicinity of...the Port-au-Prince airport...where thieves [target] returnees perceived as having access to money.\"21 However, the appellant stated that the two incidents he experienced in 2015 and 2016 had taken place near the city of Saint Marc, which is not near the Port-au-Prince airport. Therefore, the RAD notes that, even in light of the updated documentation, the appellant did not establish that he had been targeted by criminals because he returned from abroad and that he was perceived as being wealthy solely because he had returned from abroad.\n[16] Consequently, the RAD notes that the RPD did not err in concluding that the appellant did not establish, on a balance of probabilities, that he was targeted by criminals because he had returned from abroad. Although the appellant stated that the criminals who robbed him in 2016 were the same as those who had robbed him in 2015, given that he recognized their car, the RAD notes that he stated that the two incidents with the criminals took place on the road near the city of Saint Marc and that he had never spoken to them. He therefore did not establish that he was personally targeted by the criminals in question, or that it had not been by chance that he was robbed on the same road and by the same criminals. Therefore, what remains is that the appellant was a victim of the generalized violence that persists in the country to this day. The objective documentation in the NDP indicates that, in Haiti, insecurity has persisted in the country for years and criminal violence is just one manifestation of this insecurity.22 However, this type of violence is something that all people in Haiti risk encountering; therefore, it cannot constitute a basis for protection under subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nNo complaint to Haitian authorities and return to Haiti after the 2015 incident\n[17] The RPD concluded that the appellant did not rebut the presumption of state protection in Haiti since he had not even tried to obtain it.23 It noted that the appellant stated that his fear in Haiti had begun in 2015 after the first incident with the criminals but that he had returned a few months later in 2016, and that this behaviour was inconsistent with that of people who fear being persecuted or who are at risk of personal harm in their country of nationality. The appellant does not challenge these conclusions, and the RAD finds no error in the RPD's analysis or conclusion in this regard and agrees with it.\nFailure to seek asylum in the United States\n[18] The RPD found that the appellant's explanations for not seeking asylum in the United States following the incident in 2016 were not credible since, with the temporary status he had in the United States in 2016, he knew that he could be deported to Haiti, and he did not seek asylum in the country even though he had [translation] \"almost died\" in Haiti in 2016.24 The RPD concluded that this behaviour was inconsistent with that of people who have a well-founded fear of persecution or who face a risk of personal harm in their country of nationality.25 The appellant is not challenging this conclusion on appeal, and the RAD considers that the RPD did not err in its analysis or conclusion and agrees with it.\nCredibility findings\n[19] Although the RAD considers that the RPD erred in analyzing the appellant's allegations regarding his status in the United States, the RAD notes that the RPD did not err in analyzing the credibility of the appellant's allegations concerning the incidents with the criminals in 2015 and 2016. The appellant was unable to establish, on a balance of probabilities, when the key incidents of his refugee protection claim took place or the duration of his stays in Haiti when the incidents allegedly took place, owing to his contradictory and evolving testimony on those points. The appellant also failed to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the criminals targeted him because he had returned to Haiti from abroad and was considered to be wealthy, since, throughout the hearing, his testimony demonstrated that his allegations on that point were based entirely on speculation. Finally, the appellant did not file a complaint with Haitian authorities following the incident with the criminals in 2015 or after the incident in 2016, and did not seek asylum in the United States after the incident in 2016 even though he only had a temporary status in that country at the time. The RAD agrees with the RPD that these elements also undermine the credibility of his allegations.\nCONCLUSION\n[20] For all these reasons, the RAD agrees with the RPD's conclusion that the appellant failed to establish that there is a serious possibility that he would be persecuted on one of the Convention grounds, and that he also failed to establish that, on a balance of probabilities, he would be personally subjected to a danger of torture, a risk to his life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment should he return to Haiti.\nDECISION\n[21] The RAD dismisses the appeal and confirms the RPD's determination that the appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nMiriam McLeod\nMe Miriam McLeod\nOctober 16, 2020\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD File No. \/ No de dossier de la SAR : MB9-21267\nRAD.25.02 (January 14, 2020)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n4\nImmigration and Refugee\nBoard of Canada\nRefugee Appeal Division\nCommission de l'immigration\net du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 du Canada\nSection d'appel des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s\nRAD.25.02 (January 14, 2020)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] XXXX XXXX (Appellant) is an ethnic Tibetan. He was born in India to Tibetan parents on XXXX XXXX, 1975. His parents had fled to India when the Chinese Government invaded and occupied Tibet in 1959. He claims to be a citizen of China and does not have Indian citizenship.\n[2] The Appellant has worked for the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) in exile in India. He fears that the Chinese government might target him because of his association with the CTA, his religious beliefs and his political positions against the occupation of Tibet.\n[3] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) determined that the Appellant is not a Convention refugee, nor a person in need of protection. The RPD concluded that the Appellant is, according to the statute of the Indian Citizenship Act, a citizen of India by birth. The RPD found that the Appellant had not established a significant impediment preventing him from exercising his citizenship rights. The RPD also found the Appellant has not made reasonable efforts to obtain the protection of India.\n[4] The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in finding that he is an Indian citizen. Despite changes in policy, there are in practice significant impediments to being recognized as an Indian citizen or to obtain a passport. The Appellant also argues that he made reasonable effort to have his citizenship recognized by applying for a passport at the Indian Consulate in Toronto.\nDECISION\n[5] I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither Convention refugees nor a person in need of protection. The Appellant would not face significant impediments in exercising citizenship rights in India and he has not made reasonable efforts to overcome the existing impediments. The appellant does not face a serious possibility of persecution or a risk to their life, of torture or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if he was to return to India.\nNEW EVIDENCE\nThe evidence presented by the Appellant is accepted\n[6] According to the law,1 I can only accept evidence that:\ni. arose after the RPD decision; or\nii. was not reasonably available at the time of the decision; or\niii. that you could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to bring to the RPD before the decision.\n[7] If the evidence meets one or more of these requirements, I must decide if the evidence is new, credible and relevant before I can accept it.2\n[8] The Appellant request to admit the complete, 3-page article of the October 3, 2017 issue of the Tibet Sun. The Appellant explains that, only 2 of the 3 pages were submitted as evidence to the RPD due to a clerical error.\n[9] I grant the request to admit the complete Tibet Sun article. I accept that, in the circumstances, it is likely that the Appellant realized only after the RPD decision that a page was missing from the article. The article is published by a credible news organization. The extra page of the article presents relevant information on the passport application process in India. The extra page of the article also provides new evidence in the sense that it is proving the state of affairs in India.\nOral hearing\n[10] The Appellant does not request an oral hearing. The onus is on the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) to determine whether the requirements for an oral hearing set out in subsection 110(6) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) have been met.3 I do not find that the new evidence I have admitted is potentially dispositive of the refugee protection claims, nor is it central to the credibility of the Appellant. The article provides more detailed evidence for an argument that was already made by the Appellant. It also does not raise a serious issue with respect to the credibility of the Appellant who's evidence I find credible. For these reasons, there is no need for an oral hearing.\nANALYSIS\n[11] The right to Indian citizenship is articulated thus in Section 3(1) of the Indian Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003:\nCitizenship by birth.- (1) Except as provided in sub- section (2), every person born in India,\n(a) on or after the 26th day of January, 1950 , but before the 1st day of July, 1987 ;\n(b) on or after the Ist day of July, 1987 , but before the commencement of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003 and either of whose parents is a citizenof India at the time of his birth;\n(c) on or after the commencement of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003 , where-\n(i) both of his parents are citizens of India; or\n(ii) one of whose parents is a citizen of India and the other is not an illegal migrant atthe time of his birth, shall be a citizen of India by birth.\n[12] Upon reading the Act, I would agree with the RPD that by virtue of the law, the Appellant, who was born in India in 1975, is an Indian citizen by birth.\n[13] However, before coming to a definitive conclusion, I must first analyse if the Appellant has demonstrated that a significant impediment preventing him from exercising his citizenship rights exists and if reasonable efforts were made to overcome it.4\n[14] The appellant possesses the following identity documents: a valid \"identity certificate\" (IC) issued by the Indian Government establishing his birth in India in 1968 - a \"No Objection to Return\" (NORI) is stamped on his IC; a copy of a Registered Foreigner's Certificate (RC) issued by the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA); a copy of the Non-Availability certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths and a copy of his \"Green Book?.\n[15] The Appellant alleges that he faces significant impediments in exercising the citizenship right of obtaining Indian passports. He asserts that he would be unable to obtain a passport due to the Indian government's treatment of passport applications from Tibetan refugees. According to the Appellant, the secretariat of the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA), no longer issues No Objection Certificates (NOC) to Tibetan applying for Indian Passports. NOCs are required by the Indian government to obtain a passport. The Appellant submits that he made reasonable efforts to overcome these impediments.\nThe article in Tibet Sun does not establish a significant impediment preventing the Appellant from exercising his citizenship rights\n[16] The Appellant asserts, relying on the October 3, 2017 article of the Tibet Sun (the article), that Regional Passport Authorities (RPOs) discriminate against Tibetans in processing their applications. The article cites examples of Tibetans who in practice face significant impediment to being recognized as Indian citizens, after the Delhi High Court judgment of September 2016, and the March 2017 Memorandum of the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA). The Appellant also submit that the RPD erred when it found that, if harassed while applying for an Indian passport, he could seek a remedy through the courts.\n[17] I do not dispute that Indian bureaucracy surrounding the issuance of passports is complex and decentralized. I acknowledge that the article provides evidence of Tibetans facing barriers in their application process. However, I cannot determine from the article the extent of the practice - is it generalized, frequent or merely anecdotal. I note, from another article that the Appellant submitted to the RPD, that not all Tibetans suffer such obstacles. Apparently, \"since the court order, some have obtained passports, while others are encountering various obstructions?.5 Counsel points to a quote from \"Advocate Sawhney? stating that \"RPOs all over India are ignoring the Office Memorandum dated 17 March 2017?. Unfortunately, it is too vague and does not provide an indication of the scale of the problem. It says nothing of the frequency or of the number of cases. I can only conclude that there is a mere possibility that the Appellant would face harassment if he were to file a passport application at an RPO. However, the Appellant as not established on the balance of probabilities that he would personally face obstruction as in the reported cases. He does not establish either that the new policies, stemming from the Delhi High Court decision and the MEA memorandum, are not being followed generally by the Regional Passport Authorities. On the contrary, I agree with the RPD that since 2010 and more so after the Delhi High Court decision there has been significant progress for Tibetans, and that their citizenship rights are being recognized6. The reports in the article are not sufficiently probative to call into question the general policies and procedures that are applicable when applying for passports. Indeed, complications in passport applications are something that many Indians face when applying and are by no means exclusive to the Tibetan community.7\n[18] With regard to litigation. The RPD did not impose \"an obligation on the Appellant to incur [...] litigation?. The RPD found there was insufficient evidence the Appellant would personally face harassment if he applied for a passport. Litigation would be a remedy for an event that the RPD determined, on a balance of probabilities, was not likely to happen. Having concluded that the Appellant had not established he would face harassment, an analysis of possible remedies was not necessary and may have been speculative. Nevertheless, this does not invalidate the correct conclusion of the RPD that the Appellant had not proven that he would be harassed by an RPO in his own particular circumstances.\nOnly a mere possibility that a NOC will be necessary to obtain an Indian passport\n[19] The Appellant claims that that the CTA's refusal to issue NOCs prevents him from exercising his citizenship rights. This claim is based on a letter by the Kashag8 and an article published in the Tibet Sun on August 3, 2017, reporting that the Kashag, Topgyal Tsering, ordered all the departments under the CTA's authority to stop issuing NOCs9.\n[20] The letter from the Kashag does not order the departments to stop issuing NOCs. It needs to be placed in the context of the MEA's new memorandum concerning the issuance of Indian passports to Tibetans born in India. The Kashag writes: \"the Tibetan administration is under no circumstance to object to the Indian government's guidelines. It must be made known that henceforth, proof of no objection from the Department of Security and important offices within the Tibetan administration is no longer required.? The Kashag seems to be of the opinion that, in compliance with the Indian government guidelines, the CTA no longer needs to issue NOCs. The Kashag's letter lists the required documents for the issuance of a passport. The NOC is not part of that list. Moreover, the Tibet Sun article indicates that NOCs are not always required to apply and obtain a passport because the rules are not \"uniform? throughout India. The Kashag's letter and the article do not establish that the Appellant would not be able to obtain a NOC from the CTA nor that he would need one to apply for a passport. I find that it is a mere possibility that the Appellant could be asked for a NOC by the Indian authorities and that the CTA would refuse to issue one.\n[21] The Appellant also bases his argument regarding the CTA's issuing of NCOs on the case law, but these decisions predate major changes in country conditions. The courts and the executive branch of the Indian government have unequivocally affirmed that Tibetans born in India are citizens and that passport should be issued to them10. Evidence presented by Appellant demonstrates that many Tibetans have obtained Indian passports since11. The RAD gives more weight to the Ministry of External Affairs' (MEA) memorandum ordering the issuance of passports to Tibetans born in India during the relevant time period than to anecdotal reports in news articles.\n[22] The application process is not the same in India and abroad. The documented cases and the controversy involving the Kashag reported in the Tibetan Sun articles do not pertain to applications made abroad. A NOC is not required for a passport application in Canada.12 The CTA's policy regarding NOCs is certainly relevant, the Appellant might return to India and only then apply for a passport. However, claiming that the possible non-issuance of a NOC by the CTA is a significant impediment has less weight when we consider that the Appellant could apply for a passport in Canada where consular guidelines do no mention NCOs.\nInsufficient efforts to obtain a passport\n[23] Before coming to Canada, the Appellant had never applied for an Indian passport. He had not done so because he thought that an Indian birth certificate was required. The RPD member suggested that any common identity documents could be used instead, and asked the Appellant if he had ever tried to get any of them. The Appellant admitted that he had never tried to obtain common identity documents such as a PAN or an Aadhar card. He also stated that even if he could obtain Indian citizenship without a birth certificate, he was not prepared to do. The appellant wanted to remain in his home in the Tibetan settlement and wanted his children to attend Tibetan schools. Asked by the RPD if he could find work and provide for his family outside of the Tibetan settlement, the Appellant answered that it was difficult for non-citizens in India to obtain employment.\n[24] I agree with the RPD that giving up Tibetan benefits is not a significant impediment. The argument presented by the Appellant is circular: he will not leave the Tibetan settlement and forgo the benefits to obtain Indian citizenship because non-citizens cannot easily find employment to provide for themselves and their families. Relinquishing special benefits from the CTA, such as living in Tibetan settlements and receiving monetary subsidies, does not constitute a serious impediment to obtaining Indian citizenship. The Appellant will be getting all of the protections associated with citizenship in exchange for giving up benefits to which other Indian citizens do not have access. The RPD noted, correctly in my opinion, that by seeking Canada's protection the Appellant would logically have to abandon the CTA's benefits, and the opportunity of living and raising his children within the Tibetan settlement.\n[25] The Appellant has never tried to acquire full Indian citizenship while in India. He merely speculates that he would not succeed because he lacks an Indian birth certificate. It is clear that efforts in India were nonexistent13.\n[26] On XXXX XXXX, 2018, the Appellant went to the Tibetan Consulate in Toronto and presented a copy of his Registered Foreigners' Certificate (RC) and a copy of his birth certificate issued by the CTA. He was told, allegedly, that he is not entitled to an Indian passport.\n[27] The Indian consulate in Toronto processes applications for passports on-line14 and has been specifically requested to process the applications of Tibetans who were born in India during the relevant period.15 Simply presenting two documents to an attendant does not appear to be the correct procedure to apply for a passport and it is unclear what the result would have been if the Appellant had followed the correct procedure, and applied for a passport on-line. There is no indication that he made any additional efforts to obtain an Indian passport. I do not find that his visit to the consulate and conversation with an attendant establishes that he would not be able to obtain an Indian passport here in Canada. Approaching the consulate without following procedure is not a reasonable effort. The RPD's conclusion was correct.\n[28] For the above reasons, I conclude that the Appellant has not made reasonable efforts, both in India and in Canada, to overcome any impediments he may face.\nThe Appellant does not face a well-founded fear of persecution in India\n[29] The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in not considering his well-founded fear of persecution in India. The Appellant does not have a valid RC. he had not renewed it since coming to Canada. He claims he could be deported to China, where he faces persecution for his religion and political opinions. By deporting the Appellant to China, India would breach the non-refoulement principle and carry out an act of persecution.\n[30] The onus is on the Appellant to establish his allegations on a balance of probabilities. He provided no evidence that the Chinese government is aware of his existence and that it would target him, nor has he established that the Indian government would deport him to Tibet. The Appellant refers to a report on Tibetan refugees in India that documents cases of Tibetans who were deported to China because they did not have an RC. However, the report was published before the MEA memorandum and relates incidents that happened between 2013 and 2015. The report indicates that deportations of Tibetans for not having RCs were confined to the state of Himachal Pradesh, a state bordering Tibet. The report does not provide sufficient details to conclude that the Appellant would face similar circumstances if he were to return to India.\n[31] Most importantly, the RPD has correctly concluded that the Appellant is a citizen of India and that no significant impediment to exercising his citizenship exists. It is not necessary, in my opinion, to analyze the risk of deportation to Tibet. The Appellant has not demonstrated that the Indian government deports its citizens to Tibet. The report does not present cases of Tibetans who have exercised their citizenship rights being deported to Tibet. I find that the Appellant has not established a serious possibility of persecution, nor has he established, on a balance of probabilities, that he faces any risks outlined in section 97 of IRPA.\nCONCLUSION\n[32] I dismiss the appeal, and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\nGuerlain Guerrier\nGuerlain Guerrier\nSeptember 21, 2020\nDate\n2Canada (Citizenship and Immigration v.

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nOVERVIEW\n[1] The Appellant, XXXX XXXX, a citizen of Pakistan, alleged that he would face a serious risk of persecution and a probable risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment due to an incident stemming from an altercation with a local politician in his hometown. He acknowledged that he had, at one time, been a permanent resident of XXXX but he lost that status after being out of the country for over a year. The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) concluded that it would have been possible for the Appellant to apply for reinstatement of his status in XXXX. Therefore, based on the criteria set out by the Federal Court of Appeal in Zeng1, the RPD determined that the Appellant was excluded from protection under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the Act). The Appellant challenges this decision on two grounds. Firstly, the RPD created a reasonable apprehension of bias by exploring the issue of exclusion even though it was aware that the Minister of Public Security (the Minister) would not be intervening in the proceeding. Secondly, the RPD misunderstood the process the Appellant would have to follow to have his permanent resident status reinstated and erroneously assumed that the process would automatically result in his being able to return to XXXX as a permanent resident.\n[2] I find that the Minister's decision not to intervene in the RPD's proceeding had no impact on the tribunal's authority to enquire into the issue of whether the Appellant was excluded from the Act's protection. Indeed, it was incumbent upon the RPD to satisfy itself that the application satisfied the requirements of Zeng and therefore appropriate that it questions the Appellant on his efforts to reacquire permanent resident status in XXXX.\n[3] I also find that the RPD was correct in stating that there exists a process which was available to the Appellant to have his permanent resident status in XXXX reinstated. The fact that XXXX consular officials failed to inform him of that process is immaterial, as he had ample opportunity, following his arrival, in Canada to obtain information about the process and undertake efforts to pursue it. The onus on the Appellant to establish that his status could not be reinstated is not fulfilled merely by pointing out that the process is cumbersome and that a favourable outcome cannot be guaranteed.\n[4] The appeal is therefore dismissed.\nBACKGROUND\n[5] The Appellant testified that he left Pakistan in 2004 and established himself in XXXX, where he was eventually granted permanent resident status. He stayed in XXXX for nine years, moving to Canada in 2013, on a temporary work permit. He returned to Pakistan in XXXX 2015, with the intent of opening a XXXX in Rawalpindi and living there permanently. He was unaware at the time that he had lost his permanent resident status in XXXX as a result of having been outside that country for longer than 12 months.\n[6] Shortly after returning to Pakistan, the Appellant started to encounter difficulties over his refusal to hire an acquaintance of a local Member of the Provincial Assembly for the Punjab (MPA) as a partner in his business venture. He was initially threatened and subsequently beaten. He tried to file a complaint against the MPA with the police but the reaction was one of derision. The threats against the Appellant persisted and he was prevented from finishing XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. He abandoned his plans and returned to Canada in XXXX 2016, as his work permit was still valid at the time.\n[7] At the outset of the RPD's hearing, the tribunal notified the Appellant that the issues it would be considering included the question of whether he was excluded from protection under the Act2 because he had previously been a permanent resident in XXXX3. At that point, the Appellant's counsel raised an objection, stating that the Minister had been previously alerted by the RPD to the issue of a possible exclusion and responded that he would not be intervening in the proceeding. The Appellant's counsel argued that, by pursuing consideration of the issue of exclusion in the absence of the Minister, the RPD \"would be doing the work of the Minister's representative\" and therefore creating an appearance of bias4. The RPD member replied that the objection would be addressed in the written decision. The tribunal then proceeded to question the Appellant about his efforts to try to reacquire permanent resident status in XXXX.\n[8] The Appellant testified that, in XXXX 2016, he went to the XXXX consulate in Montreal. He asked about the possibility of returning to XXXX, as his work permit in Canada was about to expire. He was told that he could not go to XXXX because he was no longer considered a permanent resident status of that country. He was also provided with a document which explained how long-term absences from XXXX result in the loss of permanent resident status5.\n[9] In its written decision6, the RPD explained why it overruled the objection from the Appellant's counsel. It cited the Federal Court decision in Ahmed7, which describes the RPD as an inquisitorial body with an obligation to determine if a claimant is excluded \"whether or not the Minister elects to intervene in a given case\".\n[10] The RPD concluded that permanent residents in XXXX have the same rights and obligations as XXXX citizens and are therefore considered to be persons excludes from the Act's protection, pursuant to section 98 of the Act and article 1E of the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (the Convention). The Appellant's loss of his permanent resident status of XXXX was considered to be involuntary, in that he did not knowingly relinquish it. However, the RPD concluded that the Appellant had failed to demonstrate that he could not obtain a re-entry visa for XXXX or that his residency status could not be renewed. It found that there was a valid procedure in place to recover permanent residency in XXXX, that this procedure was \"simplified\" and that there was no evidence that the recovery of status would be denied to him. Therefore, the RPD concluded that the Appellant did not take the appropriate steps to renew his status.\n[11] The appeal is based on two grounds. Firstly, it is argued that the RPD violated principles of natural justice by considering the issue of exclusion even though the Minister had notified the RPD that he would not be raising this issue. Secondly, the Appellant disputes the RPD's finding that the simplified process was available to him, claiming that it was only intended for citizens of European Union (EU) member states. The different, more cumbersome, process which he would have to rely upon contained many steps. He describes it as complex, discretionary and offering no guarantee that it would lead to a successful outcome.\nRULING ON REQUEST FOR A RAD HEARING\n[12] The Appellant seeks a hearing before the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD). However, subsection 110(6) of the Act only allows the RAD to hold a hearing if there is new evidence to consider. The Appellant did not present any new evidence. Therefore, I cannot grant his request for a hearing.\nDETERMINATIVE ISSUES\n[13] The two issues to be decided in this appeal are as follows.\n* Did the RPD breach the rules of natural justice by raising the issue of exclusion despite the Minister having informed the Board that it would not be intervening in the proceeding?\n* Was the RPD correct in stating that the Appellant failed to meet his burden of proof with respect of the issue of exclusion?\nANALYSIS\nDid the RPD breach the rules of natural justice by raising the issue of exclusion despite the Minister having informed the Board that it would not be intervening in the proceeding?\n[14] I disagree with the Appellant's characterization of the RPD member's approach at the hearing as having been prosecutorial in nature and to have somehow usurped the role that would otherwise have fallen upon the Minister's representative. I also disagree with the suggestion that it was for the Minister to decide, rather than the tribunal, whether or not the Appellant was excluded from the Act.\n[15] The Appellant relies on the Supreme Court of Canada's statement in Ezokola8 that \"[t]he evidentiary burden falls on the Minister as the party seeking the appellant's exclusion\". However, that statement was made in the context of a proceeding in which the Minister was a party. It does not necessarily follow that a tribunal is precluded from ever addressing the issue of exclusion if the Minister chooses not to intervene. Instead, the RPD is always under an obligation to satisfy itself that the application which is before it meets all of the requirements set out in the Act. Specifically, the RPD's jurisdiction is limited by section 98, which reads: \"A person referred to in section E or F of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention is not a convention refugee or a person in need of protection\". Article 1E of the Convention indicates: \"This Convention shall not apply to a person who is recognized by the competent authorities of the country in which he has taken residence as having the rights and obligations which are attached to the possession of the nationality of that country\".\n[16] While it may be fair to read into the Minister's decision not to participate in the proceeding a tacit recognition on his part that the Appellant is not excluded from the Act, the Minister's opinion would need to be substantiated before the RPD could ever consider finding on that basis alone that the Appellant was not excluded. In other words, it is possible that the Minister was simply wrong in his assessment of the situation.\n[17] In proceeding to question the Appellant about efforts to reacquire permanent resident status in XXXX, the RPD was merely conducting the analysis required by Zeng, specifically the following:\n[28] Considering all relevant factors to the date of the hearing, does the claimant have status, substantially similar to that of its nationals, in the third country? If the answer is yes, the claimant is excluded. If the answer is no, the next question is whether the claimant previously had such status and lost it, or had access to such status and failed to acquire it. If the answer is no, the claimant is not excluded under Article 1E. If the answer is yes, the RPD must consider and balance various factors. These include, but are not limited to, the reason for the loss of status (voluntary or involuntary), whether the claimant could return to the third country, the risk the claimant would face in the home country, Canada's international obligations, and any other relevant facts.\n[emphasis added]\n[18] It might have been helpful for the RPD member to have issued an oral ruling at the hearing explaining the reasons why she was rejecting the Appellant's objection, rather than waiting until the written decision before explaining herself. Nonetheless, the member did not overstep the bounds of what was acceptable conduct on the part of an independent and impartial tribunal when she questioned the Appellant about his efforts to reacquire his status in XXXX. The manner in which she went about doing so did not violate the Appellant's right to a fair and unbiased hearing. Having reviewed the transcript of the RPD's hearing in its entirety, I am satisfied that the RPD member maintained her objectivity at all times and adopted an appropriate and unbiased tone throughout the proceeding. At no point did the RPD member say anything which could be construed as her having adopted a closed mind on the issue of exclusion.\n[19] Therefore, I conclude that the Appellant has simply misstated the law in arguing that the RPD did anything other than comply with its responsibility to apply the law and verify that it had jurisdiction to consider granting the application for asylum.\nWas the RPD correct in stating that the Appellant failed to meet his burden of proof with respect of the issue of exclusion?\n[20] The starting point of any analysis on the issue of exclusion is that \"[t]he refugee claim process is not intended to provide a route to better protection when there is existing and available protection elsewhere\"9. What needs to be considered is whether there is a reasonable opportunity for the Appellant to have his permanent resident status in XXXX reinstated. It does not matter whether the process is simple or complex, nor that there is no guarantee of a positive outcome, so long as there is a process which is available to the Appellant and which could potentially result in his being readmitted to XXXX as a permanent resident.\n[21] In his appeal submissions, the Appellant does not dispute the fact that he had acquired permanent resident status in XXXX. Before the RPD, this appeared to be an open question, as the Appellant had amended his Basis of Claim form to indicate that his residency in XXXX was temporary, not permanent10. The RPD addressed this matter at paragraph 20 of its decision and I am satisfied that its conclusion that the Appellant had permanent resident status is correct. I also agree that the Appellant's status in XXXX provided him with the same rights and obligations as XXXX nationals. Therefore, had his status not lapsed, he would have been excluded from protection.\n[22] It is unclear whether the simplified process described in the XXXX law would be available to the Appellant, given that it is described as applying \"mostly to persons who have resided in another Member State [of the EU] for their studies\"11. There is insufficient information on file to establish to what extent persons who are not students from an EU country would be eligible to apply using the simplified process.\n[23] Nonetheless, there was another process, available generally to all former permanent residents, which the Appellant could have pursued. The Appellant points out that this is a cumbersome process, which offers no guarantee that he would receive a favourable decision. I do not consider that these factors are adequate reasons to justify his decision not to make an application to XXXX authorities to have his status reinstated.\n[24] I am mindful of the evidence provided by the Appellant that XXXX consular officials in Montreal failed to inform him of the availability of a process to have his status reinstated. Nonetheless, they did not mislead him either - they simply provided incomplete information. The Appellant himself did not ask whether there was an opportunity to have his status reinstated. In the XXXX months between the Appellant's return to Canada (XXXX 2016) and the date of his hearing before the RPD (May 2017), there would have been ample opportunity for the Appellant to fully explore with legal counsel who represented him before the RPD what options existed to have his permanent resident status in XXXX reinstated. He decided that he would prefer instead to pursue his application for refugee determination in Canada.\n[25] The Appellant claims that he cannot avail himself of the reinstatement process because this would require him to travel to XXXX, for which he would need to be granted a visa. While it does appear from article 159 of the applicable XXXX legislation that the determination process could require the Appellant to return to XXXX to complete certain steps of that process, issuance of a visa for that purpose by XXXX consular officials would occur automatically, provided that the fee for the visa procedure was paid. I find that the Appellant has not established that the requirement to obtain a visa to return to XXXX would be an obstacle to his permanent resident status being reinstated. My understanding is that the only obstacles facing applicants is if they have a criminal record or suffer from any quarantinable diseases.\n[26] As a result, I am in agreement with the RPD that the Appelant did not meet his burden of proof with respect to the issue of whether he could reasonably be expected to reacquire his permanent resident status in XXXX had he made an application to that effect.\n[27] One final point which needs to be addressed is the fact that the RPD did not address two of the criteria mentioned in Zeng, which are the risk in the home country, in this case, Pakistan, and Canada's international obligations. At paragraph 37 of its decision, the RPD cited the Federal Court's decision in Osazuwa12 in support of its conclusion that the alleged risk in the home country was not a relevant factor given that there is a procedure in place for the Appellant to recover his permanent residence in XXXX. I consider this conclusion to be a correct interpretation of the case law. For the same reason, no consideration has to be given to Canada's international obligations.\nCONCLUSION\n[28] The RPD did not violate principles of natural justice or procedural fairness when it canvassed the issue of whether the Appellant was excluded from protection under the Act. The Appellant failed to establish that he could not return to XXXX as a permanent resident. As a result, his application does not satisfy the requirements of Zeng. The appeal is therefore dismissed.\n(signed)\n\"Philippe Rabot\"\nPhilippe Rabot\nDecember 9, 2019\nDate\n11RPD-1, Exhibit 10, RPD record: Response to Information Request ESP105326.E, 8 October 2015 - XXXX: Permanent residence, status, including requirements, whether it expires and procedure for renewal; rights for permanent residents, including rights to enter and remain, employment rights, education rights, and access to social services (2014-August 2015), at pages 177 and 178, article 159.\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRAD File \/ Dossier de la SAR : MB7-07740\nRAD.25.02 (April 04, 2019)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n9\nImmigration and Refugee\nBoard of Canada\nRefugee Appeal Division\nCommission de l'immigration\net du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 du Canada\nSection d'appel des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s\nRAD.25.02 (April 04, 2019)\nDisponible en fran\u00e7ais\n",

        "unofficial_text":"REASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (the \"female Appellant\"), XXXX XXXX XXXX (the \"male Appellant\"), XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (the \"minor Appellants\") are citizens of Sudan. They are appealing a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) denying their claim for refugee protection. The Appellants argue that the RPD erred in its internal flight alternative (IFA) analysis and its credibility assessment. After careful review of the evidence in the record, the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) finds that the Appellants have a viable IFA in Port Sudan. Therefore, they are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection.\n[2] For the reasons provided below, this appeal is dismissed.\nBACKGROUND\n[3] The Appellants allege that the female Appellant's family is demanding to conduct female genital mutilation (FGM) on the minor female Appellants. They also claim that the female Appellant's family will physically harm the male Appellant for refusing to allow the FGM on his daughters. The female Appellant further alleges that the minor male Appellant would be targeted by the agent of persecution in order to coerce her into agreeing to the FGM of the minor female Appellants. Further details are provided in their Basis of Claim (BOC) Forms, and their testimony at the RPD hearing.1\nThe RPD's Decision\n[4] The Appellants had a refugee determination hearing on July 11, 2017. In a written decision issued on August 24, 2017, the RPD rejected their claim. The RPD panel found the Appellants had a viable IFA in Port Sudan. Therefore, the RPD concluded that the Appellants do not have a well-founded fear of persecution on a Convention ground, or that they would not personally be subjected to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or a danger of torture upon return to Sudan.\nROLE OF THE RAD\n[5] For questions of fact, mixed fact and law, and law, the RAD applies the standard of correctness in accordance with the Federal Court of Appeal's decision in Huruglica.2 In assessing findings involving the credibility of oral testimony, the RAD may apply the modified standard of reasonableness in situations where the RPD enjoys a meaningful advantage.3 Unless otherwise stated in the reasons, the RAD uses the correctness standard on all findings and will consider the overall refugee determination on a standard of correctness, even where the RAD has deferred on some or all findings.\nADMISSIBILITY OF EVIDENCE SUBMITTED ON APPEAL\n[6] Evidence from the person who is the subject of the appeal is only admissible on appeal if it meets one of the statutory conditions set out in subsection 110(4) of the IRPA, namely that it arose after, or was not reasonably available, or the person could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented the evidence at the time the claim was rejected. If one of these conditions is met, the RAD will then consider if the evidence is credible, relevant, and new as endorsed by the Federal Court of Appeal in Singh.4\n[7] In support of their appeal, the Appellants propose two documents as new evidence:\n1) Permission to Use Tinted Glass Card of the Female Appellant's Brother-in-Law, issue date unknown, valid until 23 March 2008;5 and,\n2) Marriage Certificate of the female Appellant's Sister and her Brother-in-Law, dated XXXX XXXX 1984.6\nThe Appellant's Argument on Admissibility of the New Evidence\n[8] The Appellants argue that the identity document from the female Appellant's brother-in-law regarding the permission to use tinted glass, and the marriage certificate of her sister and brother-in-law were not reasonably available at the time of the RPD's decision. They submit that although she received them on July 18, 2017, after the RPD hearing, they were not reasonably available because the Appellants were not aware of the rules regarding the submission of post-hearing evidence to the RPD and they did not advise their counsel that they received these documents.\n[9] They further argue that these two documents are relevant, probative and corroborate the female Appellant's testimony that her brother-in-law has the ability to reach her daughters in any part of Sudan and supports her testimony that her brother-in-law was a powerful man with connections to the regime that would enable him to find them in any part of Sudan. In regards to the marriage certificate, they submit that it is probative, relevant, and it corroborates the female Appellant's testimony that the agent of persecution married into her family.\nThe RAD's Assessment of the New Evidence\n[10] I reject the Appellants' submissions and find the two documents provided as new evidence are inadmissible.\n[11] I do not accept the Appellants' explanation for why these documents could not have been provided at the time of the RPD's decision. The female Appellant's appeal affidavit states that although she had these documents prior to the RPD's decision, she never informed their counsel of the documents. The affidavit also implies that their former counsel did not advise them that they could provide post-hearing evidence, as he only told them after the RPD hearing that they would wait for the decision.7 However, notice has not been given to their former counsel, and as such, he has not had an opportunity to respond to the allegation that he did not advise the Appellants that they could provide post-hearing evidence to the RPD. Rather, the evidence before me is that the Appellants had nearly six weeks to provide post-hearing evidence and they were represented by competent counsel throughout the proceeding. Furthermore, although the Appellants provide an email from the female Appellant's niece to support that these documents were obtained on July 18, 2017, it is not clear whether any documents were attached to the email received by the female Appellant on July 18, 2017. In this respect, I note that the email chain provided indicates several documents were attached and sent to the female Appellant on May 7, 2017, which was before the RPD hearing. In light of the above, I find that the Appellants have not established that they could not have provided the above documents at the time the RPD rejected their claim. Therefore, I find the two documents submitted as new evidence do not meet the criteria of subsection 110(4).\n[12] Moreover, I note that the identity card of the brother-in-law expired more than 10 years ago and gives him permission to drive with window tinting. The Appellants provide no submissions in accordance with 3(3)(g)(iii) on how this document is relevant or credible with respect to the brother-in-law's power or his ability to locate the Appellants in Port Sudan in 2018. Also, I observe that the marriage certificate submitted is irrelevant to the issue in this appeal. There is no dispute as to whether the alleged agent of persecution is married to the female Appellant's sister, and therefore, it does not meet the relevance criteria in Singh.\n[13] For the above reasons, I find the two documents submitted as new evidence are not admissible as new evidence.\nApplication to Submit Additional Documents (Rule 29 Application)\n[14] The Appellants submit an application under Rule 29 of the Refugee Appeal Division Rules for the admission of documents not previously provided. The Appellants request to submit an affidavit from the female Appellant's niece attesting to how she obtained the documents provided with the Appellant's record and explaining why she wrote a support letter in her mother's name at the RPD hearing.8\n[15] Rule 29 allows the Appellants to make an application to provide a document not previously provided. Such an application must include an explanation of how the document meets the requirements of subsection 110(4) of the IRPA and how that evidence relates to the Appellants.9 In determining the application, the RAD must consider any relevant factors, including: the relevance and probative value of the document, any new evidence the document brings to the appeal, and whether the Appellants could have, with reasonable effort, provided the document with the Appellants' Record.\nThe Appellants' Argument on the Rule 29 Application\n[16] The Appellants argue that the affidavit from the female Appellant's niece should be accepted. They submit that it post-dates the submission of the appeal record, as well as the RPD hearing and RPD's decision. They submit the affidavit was not available at the time the appeal record was submitted because the niece was sick. They also argue that the affidavit is relevant and probative, as it provides an explanation which goes to the negative credibility inference of the RPD about the letter purportedly written by the female Appellant's sister. They further submit that this affidavit should be read in conjunction with the documents provided above, as the affidavit explains how the documents were obtained in Sudan on July 18, 2017.\nThe RAD's Assessment of the Rule 29 Application\n[17] I reject the Rule 29 Application. For the reasons provided above, the two documents allegedly obtained by the female Appellant's niece are inadmissible under subsection 110(4). The content of the niece's affidavit dealing with how she got those two documents does not address or remedy the reasons provided above in finding the documents were inadmissible under 110(4) and for credibility and relevance concerns. Therefore, this portion of the niece's affidavit is not accepted.\n[18] With respect to the niece's explanation for why she forged a document in her mother's name in order to support the Appellants' refugee claim, I also reject this aspect of the niece's affidavit. I find the Appellants have not established that the niece's affidavit could not have been provided at the time the appeal record was submitted. While the female Appellant and niece claim she was too ill to see a commissioner of oaths, the Appellants had more than a few days to provide an affidavit from the niece. The female Appellant's affidavit with the Rule 29 application states that she did not contact her niece until November 8, 2017, which is the day the appeal record was submitted to the RAD, and a day before the appeal record was received by the RAD. I also note that the RPD's decision was sent from the RPD registry on October 3, 2017 and the Appellants have not explained why they waited until the day before the appeal record was submitted to request an explanation from her niece for the fraudulent document, especially considering this was discussed during her RPD hearing and assessed in the RPD's decision. Her illness of a few days does not explain why the affidavit could not have been provided at the time the appeal record was submitted. Therefore, I reject the Appellants' Rule 29 application as the Appellants have not established that with reasonable effort the niece's affidavit could not have been provided with the appeal record.\nRequest for an Oral Hearing\n[19] As there is no new evidence being accepted by the RAD, there can be no oral hearing in accordance to subsection 110(6) of the IRPA. Therefore, the application for an oral hearing is dismissed.\nDETERMINATIVE ISSUE\n[20] The determinative issue is whether the RPD erred in its IFA assessment.\nANALYSIS\nThe RAD find the Appellants have a viable IFA in Port Sudan\n[21] In order to determine whether a viable IFA exists, the RAD must consider the two-prong test outlined in Rasaratnam10 and Thirunavukkarasu.11 From these cases it is clear that the test to be applied in determining whether there is a viable IFA is:\n(a) The RAD must be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that there is no serious possibility of the appellant being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an IFA exists;12 and,\n(b) Conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable, in all circumstances, including those particular to the appellant, for her to seek refuge there.13\n[22] Both prongs must be satisfied to find that the Appellants have an IFA. The Appellants bear the burden of proof to show that they face a serious possibility or reasonable chance of persecution in the entire country and specifically in the potential IFA area. In this case, the proposed IFA area is Port Sudan, Sudan.\nThe Appellants' Argument - 1st Prong of the IFA Test\n[23] The Appellants argue the RPD erred because it placed a lot of weight on the omission in the U.S. claim and the BOC, that the female Appellant's brother-in-law was an agent of persecution. Although the brother-in-law was not specifically mentioned, it was clear that the emphasis in both claims was that they were afraid the female Appellant's family would perform FGM on the female minor Appellants, so it was unreasonable for the RPD to make an adverse credibility finding for failing to specifically name the brother-in-law. They submit that the whole issue of the brother-in-law's participation and advocacy of the practice of FGM arose from the RPD's questioning about the female Appellant's sister. As such, the RPD did not fully appreciate that the risk was not only the brother-in-law as an agent of persecution, but the female Appellant's family, which is what she said in her BOC. However, it was the RPD's questioning that resulted in its conclusion that it was only the brother-in-law who was the agent of persecution.\n[24] The Appellants also argue that the RPD's IFA analysis was heavily premised on the fact that there was no evidence her family could find her there, which was pure speculation. Especially considering the female Appellant testified she did not feel safe anywhere in the country and that her brother-in-law could reach her if he is whom the female Appellant claims. They also submit that the RPD did not deal with the evidence that the female Appellant's family was mad that she and her husband escaped with the children.\n[25] The Appellants submit that the RPD was overzealous in its search for discrepancies between the oral testimony and the BOC, but while the oral testimony and the BOC was not word for word the same, the essence of the claim is clearly conveyed in the BOC. In this case, they argue that it was unreasonable for the RPD to conclude the female minor Appellants did not face more than a minimal chance of persecution, as they are clearly being sought by the female Appellant's family. They argue that the fact that there is no documentary evidence with respect to the brother-in-law's government connections is beside the point.\n[26] With respect to the RPD's finding about the declaration signed by the female Appellant's niece in her mother's name, the Appellants submit that this is adequately explained in the new evidence affidavit from the female Appellant's niece.\nThe RAD's Assessment - 1st Prong of the IFA Test\n[27] I reject the Appellants' argument and find the RPD did not err. Even though the RPD accepted that FGM is prevalent in the country, and there are few legal impediments, this does not factor into the assessment as to whether Port Sudan is a viable IFA for the Appellants based on their circumstances. This is because the RPD found that the Appellants failed to establish that their alleged agents of persecution have the influence or means to locate them in Sudan. In addition, the RPD noted that there is no indication that any other party, including the state, would perform FGM on minors without parental consent. On the latter point, the RPD noted that the male and female Appellants are opposed to the practice.\n[28] First, with respect to the BOC omission about the female Appellant's brother-in-law, I disagree with the Appellants' submission. The BOC clearly informs the Appellants to include in their BOC everything that is important for their claim, such as dates, names and places. The Appellants signed their BOC forms and signed a declaration that it was fully interpreted to them. The omission of a powerful and influential family member who threatened the male Appellant, and allegedly has the ability to locate the Appellants throughout Sudan is not a minor detail, but central to their refugee claim and fear of persecution.\n[29] In their U.S and Canada narratives, the Appellants provided little details about their alleged agents of persecution. In both narratives, the Appellants mention briefly the female Appellant's mother and her family as the agents of persecution. No details are provided in the narratives as to the capacity, reach and influence of these agents, only that they insisted on performing FGM. In the BOC, it merely mentions that the male Appellant would be at risk for allowing his family to escape the practice. It was only at the RPD hearing when the RPD questioned about the female Appellant's meeting with her mother, where they wanted the minor daughters to undergo FGM, that she testified about the specific threat against her husband from her brother-in-law. At this time, the female Appellant also described the brother-in-law's background and why they felt so threatened. This is not an elaborative detail omitted from the BOC, but a significant fact central to their refugee claim. When confronted with the omission, the female Appellant failed to provide an adequate explanation, as she blamed her former U.S. counsel for not including this detail in their documents. I also do not accept this explanation, as it does not explain why the Appellants did not inform their Canadian counsel of this agent and the threat and why it is omitted from her Canadian narrative. The BOC forms the basis of her refugee claim in Canada and they were assisted by counsel in the preparation of their claim. One would expect such details to be included in her BOC. Her explanation does not explain why such information is not in her Canadian narrative. Therefore, I find the RPD did not err and I also draw a negative credibility inference due to the omission of the \"powerful\" and \"influential\" brother-in-law from the Appellants' BOC.\n[30] Second, while I acknowledge the Appellants' argument that the RPD did not adequately consider that the agent of persecution was not just the brother-in-law, but the female Appellant's \"family\", I do not find the RPD erred in this regard. The RPD's questioning, as well as its findings on the brother-in-law as an agent of persecution, was in response to the details provided by the female Appellant at the hearing, as well as the issue of whether Port Sudan was a viable IFA. Considering the Appellants provided scant evidence about how her \"family\" would find them in Port Sudan, and she did not even know if there were any extended family in Port Sudan, it was appropriate for the RPD to focus on the allegations that her brother-in-law was an influential and powerful person who could locate and harm them throughout Sudan. The RPD did what it was required to do by questioning the Appellants on this critical allegation and being responsive to the issues identified at the outset of the hearing. It was necessary for the RPD to assess the viability of the IFA in light of the allegation that there was a member of the family that was powerful and connected enough to locate them in the IFA.\n[31] Moreover, the RPD noted that the Appellants did not establish that anyone in their family, or even persons outside the family, have the influence or means to locate them in Port Sudan. It is the Appellants' burden to establish this fact, which they failed to do in this case. In fact, the female Appellant testified that she was not sure if there were extended family in Port Sudan who could locate her there, and that most of her family are in Khartoum, which is more than 14 hours distance by bus. The only evidence presented of an agent of persecution who could locate them in the IFA was her brother-in-law, evidence the RPD found not credible.\n[32] Third, the RPD found additional reasons to question the credibility of the allegation that their alleged agent of persecution could locate them in Port Sudan. In particular, the RPD found that the Appellants submitted a fraudulent document about who was after them, and it found that they did not provide a reasonable explanation for the lack of documentation about the power and influence of the brother-in-law. Other than providing new evidence to address these findings, which the RAD has found inadmissible, the Appellants provide no submissions about how the RPD erred in this assessment. Considering the Appellants do not contest these findings I see no reason to interfere with them. They are correct and based on the evidence in the record. In particular, I note that the female Appellant acknowledged that the support letter from her sister was not genuine. As well, the female Appellant was inconsistent in her testimony about whether she tried to get documents to support her claim, including documents about her brother-in-law's means and ability to locate them throughout Sudan. I concur with the RPD that the fraudulent document and lack of documentation about the agent of persecution, undermines their credibility regarding the alleged agent of persecution and the ability of her family to locate the Appellants in the IFA.\n[33] Based on the above credibility concerns, I find the Appellants are not credible regarding their alleged agent of persecution. As such, I find they have not established with sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence that their alleged agents of persecution would locate them in Port Sudan.14 Nor have they demonstrated that Port Sudan would not be a safe area to relocate. Therefore, I find the Appellants have not established that they face a serious possibility of persecution nor a risk to life, danger of torture or of cruel and unusual treatment in Port Sudan.\nThe Appellants' Argument - 2nd Prong of the IFA Test\n[34] The Appellants provide no submissions on how the RPD erred in its assessment of the second prong of the IFA test. Rather, the Appellants simply state that the second prong only becomes engaged where the particular claimant does not face a well-founded fear of persecution in the proposed IFA, so they submit that the RPD's assessment that there is no reasonable chance of persecution in the IFA was unreasonable.15\nThe RAD's Assessment - 2nd Prong of the IFA Test\n[35] Considering the Appellants do not contest the RPD's findings about whether it is reasonable for the Appellants to relocate to Port Sudan, I see no reason to interfere with it. It is correct and based on the evidence in the record.16 The Appellants have the burden of establishing that the IFA is not reasonable in their circumstances, but have failed to do so in this case.\n[36] I agree with the RPD's reasons for finding that it would not be unreasonable for the Appellants to relocate to Port Sudan in their circumstances. The Appellants are well-educated possessing 16 and 17 years of education, and possess degrees in engineering and IT. They also have significant work experience with a bank and an oil company and will be able to relocate as a family unit with a male head of the household. Furthermore, they speak the language and practice the religion in Port Sudan, and there is no indication that the Appellants will be deprived of education or healthcare compared to persons in their home city of Khartoum.\n[37] Therefore, I find that the proposed IFA of Port Sudan is not unduly harsh or objectively unreasonable in the Appellants' circumstances.\nCONCLUSION\n[38] Having reviewed the whole record, including the testimony of the Appellants and the documentary evidence, I agree with the RPD for the same reasons, that Port Sudan is a viable IFA within Sudan. Therefore, the Appellants are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection. This appeal is dismissed.\nDETERMINATION\n[39] The RAD dismisses the appeal and confirms the decision of the RPD that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection, pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\n(signed)\n\"G.
